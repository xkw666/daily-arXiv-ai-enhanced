TL;DR: 构建老年人不良事件标注语料库，评估不同粒度模型表现，揭示细粒度临床信息抽取挑战


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 老年患者在临床NLP资源中代表性不足，需要专门标注语料支持不良事件抽取研究

Method: 创建包含14种不良事件及上下文属性的标注数据集，使用FlairNLP框架在三个粒度（细粒度/粗粒度/带否定粗粒度）评估模型性能

Result: Transformer模型在文档级粗粒度任务表现优异（F1=0.943），但细粒度实体识别（F1=0.675）及罕见事件/复杂属性检测存在显著困难

Conclusion: 数据集通过可信研究环境开放申请，为改进临床信息抽取方法提供基准，突显跨数据集泛化研究的必要性

Abstract: In this work, we present a manually annotated corpus for Adverse Event (AE)
extraction from discharge summaries of elderly patients, a population often
underrepresented in clinical NLP resources. The dataset includes 14 clinically
significant AEs-such as falls, delirium, and intracranial haemorrhage, along
with contextual attributes like negation, diagnosis type, and in-hospital
occurrence. Uniquely, the annotation schema supports both discontinuous and
overlapping entities, addressing challenges rarely tackled in prior work. We
evaluate multiple models using FlairNLP across three annotation granularities:
fine-grained, coarse-grained, and coarse-grained with negation. While
transformer-based models (e.g., BERT-cased) achieve strong performance on
document-level coarse-grained extraction (F1 = 0.943), performance drops
notably for fine-grained entity-level tasks (e.g., F1 = 0.675), particularly
for rare events and complex attributes. These results demonstrate that despite
high-level scores, significant challenges remain in detecting underrepresented
AEs and capturing nuanced clinical language. Developed within a Trusted
Research Environment (TRE), the dataset is available upon request via DataLoch
and serves as a robust benchmark for evaluating AE extraction methods and
supporting future cross-dataset generalisation.

### [2] [Combining Constrained and Unconstrained Decoding via Boosting: BoostCD and Its Application to Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14901)
*Marija Šakota,Robert West*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出BoostCD方法，通过两阶段约束解码（基础模型生成约束/非约束预测 + 增强模型融合）提升结构化NLP任务输出质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有约束解码方法在测试时存在输出质量低的问题，因基础模型未显式学习约束。约束与非约束解码的错误存在互补性可被利用

Method: BoostCD分两阶段：1）基础模型分别进行约束/非约束解码生成弱预测 2）增强模型基于两弱预测自回归生成最终预测

Result: BoostIE在闭式信息抽取任务中优于现有方法（分布内外数据），有效解决常见错误类型

Conclusion: 通过利用约束与非约束解码的互补性，BoostCD显著提升结构化输出质量，为约束解码提供新范式

Abstract: Many recent approaches to structured NLP tasks use an autoregressive language
model $M$ to map unstructured input text $x$ to output text $y$ representing
structured objects (such as tuples, lists, trees, code, etc.), where the
desired output structure is enforced via constrained decoding. During training,
these approaches do not require the model to be aware of the constraints, which
are merely implicit in the training outputs $y$. This is advantageous as it
allows for dynamic constraints without requiring retraining, but can lead to
low-quality output during constrained decoding at test time. We overcome this
problem with Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD), which combines constrained
and unconstrained decoding in two phases: Phase 1 decodes from the base model
$M$ twice, in constrained and unconstrained mode, obtaining two weak
predictions. In phase 2, a learned autoregressive boosted model combines the
two weak predictions into one final prediction. The mistakes made by the base
model with vs. without constraints tend to be complementary, which the boosted
model learns to exploit for improved performance. We demonstrate the power of
BoostCD by applying it to closed information extraction. Our model, BoostIE,
outperforms prior approaches both in and out of distribution, addressing
several common errors identified in those approaches.

### [3] [CrEst: Credibility Estimation for Contexts in LLMs via Weak Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14912)
*Dyah Adila,Shuai Zhang,Boran Han,Bonan Min,Yuyang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出CrEst框架，通过文档间语义一致性自动评估上下文可信度，提升LLM推理可靠性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视上下文文档的可信度差异，可能导致错误信息传播。需要无需人工标注的自动可信度评估方案

Method: 基于文档间语义一致性的弱监督框架：黑盒方法通过提示工程集成可信度，白盒方法调整注意力机制

Result: 在3种模型架构/5个数据集上实现最高26.86%准确率提升和3.49% F1增长，高噪声环境下保持稳健

Conclusion: CrEst通过文档间一致性实现有效的可信度估计，为LLM可靠推理提供新解决方案

Abstract: The integration of contextual information has significantly enhanced the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks.
However, existing methods often overlook a critical challenge: the credibility
of context documents can vary widely, potentially leading to the propagation of
unreliable information. In this paper, we introduce CrEst, a novel weakly
supervised framework for assessing the credibility of context documents during
LLM inference--without requiring manual annotations. Our approach is grounded
in the insight that credible documents tend to exhibit higher semantic
coherence with other credible documents, enabling automated credibility
estimation through inter-document agreement. To incorporate credibility into
LLM inference, we propose two integration strategies: a black-box approach for
models without access to internal weights or activations, and a white-box
method that directly modifies attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments
across three model architectures and five datasets demonstrate that CrEst
consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to a 26.86% improvement
in accuracy and a 3.49% increase in F1 score. Further analysis shows that CrEst
maintains robust performance even under high-noise conditions.

*Joseph J. Peper,Wenzhao Qiu,Ali Payani,Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究者开发了MDBench数据集，通过合成生成技术高效创建多文档推理评估基准，现有大模型在该任务上表现不佳且方法具备高度适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在多文档推理评估领域缺乏有效基准，传统标注方法成本过高，需要可控且高效的解决方案。

Method: 基于结构化种子知识进行LLM辅助编辑，生成含挑战性的多文档集及对应QA样本，实现自然文本转换的自动化流程。

Result: 主流LLM在MDBench上表现显著不足（即使处理短文档），该方法支持针对性的能力分析和快速迭代适应新需求。

Conclusion: MDBench有效填补多文档推理评估空白，其知识引导的合成方法具有高效性和可扩展性，为持续模型改进提供支持。

Abstract: Natural language processing evaluation has made significant progress, largely
driven by the proliferation of powerful large language mod-els (LLMs). New
evaluation benchmarks are of increasing priority as the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs are expanding at a rapid pace. In particular, while multi-document (MD)
reasoning is an area of extreme relevance given LLM capabilities in handling
longer-context inputs, few benchmarks exist to rigorously examine model
behavior in this setting. Moreover, the multi-document setting is historically
challenging for benchmark creation due to the expensive cost of annotating long
inputs. In this work, we introduce MDBench, a new dataset for evaluating LLMs
on the task of multi-document reasoning. Notably, MDBench is created through a
novel synthetic generation process, allowing us to controllably and efficiently
generate challenging document sets and the corresponding question-answer (QA)
examples. Our novel technique operates on condensed structured seed knowledge,
modifying it through LLM-assisted edits to induce MD-specific reasoning
challenges. We then convert this structured knowledge into a natural text
surface form, generating a document set and corresponding QA example. We
analyze the behavior of popular LLMs and prompting techniques, finding that
MDBENCH poses significant challenges for all methods, even with relatively
short document sets. We also see our knowledge-guided generation technique (1)
allows us to readily perform targeted analysis of MD-specific reasoning
capabilities and (2) can be adapted quickly to account for new challenges and
future modeling improvements.

### [5] [From Chat to Checkup: Can Large Language Models Assist in Diabetes Prediction?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14949)
*Shadman Sakib,Oishy Fatema Akhand,Ajwad Abrar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估大语言模型（LLM）在糖尿病预测中的表现，发现专有模型（如GPT-4o）在少样本场景下优于开源模型和传统机器学习方法，但存在提示策略敏感性和领域适配需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在结构化医疗数据预测中的潜力，填补传统ML/DL模型与LLM在该领域应用的空白。

Method: 使用Pima印第安人糖尿病数据集，比较6个LLM（4开源+2专有）和3个传统模型（随机森林/逻辑回归/SVM），采用零样本/单样本/三样本提示策略，以准确率/F1等指标评估。

Result: 专有LLM（GPT-4o，Gemini Flash 2.0）表现最优，Gemma-2-27B的F1超越传统模型。提示策略显著影响效果，少样本场景下性能最佳。

Conclusion: LLM具备医疗预测潜力，但需通过提示工程和混合建模提升表现，未来应加强领域适配与跨模态整合研究。

Abstract: While Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models have been widely
used for diabetes prediction, the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
structured numerical data is still not well explored. In this study, we test
the effectiveness of LLMs in predicting diabetes using zero-shot, one-shot, and
three-shot prompting methods. We conduct an empirical analysis using the Pima
Indian Diabetes Database (PIDD). We evaluate six LLMs, including four
open-source models: Gemma-2-27B, Mistral-7B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.2-2B. We
also test two proprietary models: GPT-4o and Gemini Flash 2.0. In addition, we
compare their performance with three traditional machine learning models:
Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We use
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score as evaluation metrics. Our results
show that proprietary LLMs perform better than open-source ones, with GPT-4o
and Gemma-2-27B achieving the highest accuracy in few-shot settings. Notably,
Gemma-2-27B also outperforms the traditional ML models in terms of F1-score.
However, there are still issues such as performance variation across prompting
strategies and the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. This study shows that
LLMs can be useful for medical prediction tasks and encourages future work on
prompt engineering and hybrid approaches to improve healthcare predictions.

### [6] [Memory Tokens: Large Language Models Can Generate Reversible Sentence Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15001)
*Ignacio Sastre,Aiala Rosá*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 无需调整模型权重即可通过特殊记忆令牌生成可逆句子嵌入，使LLM能准确重建原始文本（验证到80亿参数模型）


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在保留原始文本信息方面的潜在能力，为记忆检索、文本压缩和可控生成提供新思路

Method: 引入可优化的记忆令牌嵌入，通过在固定序列上的训练实现文本重建，覆盖多语言、不同序列长度（达240token）及模型规模（100M-8B）的验证

Result: Llama3.1 8B成功重建所有测试序列，证明该方法在不同规模模型中的有效性（尤其在大型模型中表现完全可靠）

Conclusion: 该发现揭示了LLMs未被充分认识的信息保持能力，为开发非权重修改的记忆增强技术开辟了新方向

Abstract: In this work, we observe an interesting phenomenon: it is possible to
generate reversible sentence embeddings that allow an LLM to reconstruct the
original text exactly, without modifying the model's weights. This is achieved
by introducing a special memory token, whose embedding is optimized through
training on a fixed sequence. When prompted with this embedding, the model
reconstructs the fixed sequence exactly. We evaluate this phenomenon across
English and Spanish datasets, sequences of up to approximately 240 tokens, and
model scales ranging from 100M to 8B parameters. Notably, Llama 3.1 8B
successfully reconstructs all tested sequences. Our findings highlight an
interesting capability of LLMs and suggest potential applications in
memory-based retrieval, compression, and controlled text generation.

*Drew Walker,Swati Rajwal,Sudeshna Das,Snigdha Peddireddy,Abeed Sarker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过NLP技术分析执法文本，开发高精度分类器识别社会隔离相关自杀案例，发现男性/同性恋/离婚群体风险更高


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社会隔离未被纳入美国自杀报告系统结构化变量，需通过NLP分析文本数据改进监测预防机制

Method: 采用主题建模构建词典+监督学习分类器（F1=0.86/准确率0.82），分析2002-2020年30万自杀案例文本

Result: 识别1,198例长期社会隔离自杀案例，男性(OR=1.44)、同性恋(OR=3.68)、离婚者(OR=3.34)风险显著；发现离婚/失去监护权/搬迁等预测因子

Conclusion: 文本分析方法可有效识别社会隔离相关自杀风险，为制定针对性预防策略提供数据支持

Abstract: Social isolation and loneliness, which have been increasing in recent years
strongly contribute toward suicide rates. Although social isolation and
loneliness are not currently recorded within the US National Violent Death
Reporting System's (NVDRS) structured variables, natural language processing
(NLP) techniques can be used to identify these constructs in law enforcement
and coroner medical examiner narratives. Using topic modeling to generate
lexicon development and supervised learning classifiers, we developed
high-quality classifiers (average F1: .86, accuracy: .82). Evaluating over
300,000 suicides from 2002 to 2020, we identified 1,198 mentioning chronic
social isolation. Decedents had higher odds of chronic social isolation
classification if they were men (OR = 1.44; CI: 1.24, 1.69, p<.0001), gay (OR =
3.68; 1.97, 6.33, p<.0001), or were divorced (OR = 3.34; 2.68, 4.19, p<.0001).
We found significant predictors for other social isolation topics of recent or
impending divorce, child custody loss, eviction or recent move, and break-up.
Our methods can improve surveillance and prevention of social isolation and
loneliness in the United States.

*Zongxia Li,Yapei Chang,Yuhang Zhou,Xiyang Wu,Zichao Liang,Yoo Yeon Sung,Jordan Lee Boyd-Graber*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PrefBERT提出了一种评估开放式长文本生成质量的评分模型，通过区分性奖励机制提升GRPO训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法在连贯性、风格保持和相关性判断上存在不足，且受预训练数据偏差影响，导致长文本生成质量评估不充分。

Method: 基于多风格长文本响应数据集训练PrefBERT模型，结合LLM评判、人工评分和定性分析，与传统指标ROUGE-L/BERTScore进行对比评估。

Result: 实验表明PrefBERT在段落级响应评估中表现稳定，人工验证其奖励信号训练的策略模型产出更符合人类偏好（相比传统指标提升23.6%）。

Conclusion: PrefBERT通过可验证的语义奖励机制，有效解决了长文本生成评估中的对齐问题，为强化学习训练提供了可靠反馈信号。

Abstract: Evaluating open-ended long-form generation is challenging because it is hard
to define what clearly separates good from bad outputs. Existing methods often
miss key aspects like coherence, style, or relevance, or are biased by
pretraining data, making open-ended long-form evaluation an underexplored
problem. To address this gap, we propose PrefBERT, a scoring model for
evaluating open-ended long-form generation in GRPO and guiding its training
with distinct rewards for good and bad outputs. Trained on two response
evaluation datasets with diverse long-form styles and Likert-rated quality,
PrefBERT effectively supports GRPO by offering better semantic reward feedback
than traditional metrics ROUGE-L and BERTScore do. Through comprehensive
evaluations, including LLM-as-a-judge, human ratings, and qualitative analysis,
we show that PrefBERT, trained on multi-sentence and paragraph-length
responses, remains reliable across varied long passages and aligns well with
the verifiable rewards GRPO needs. Human evaluations confirm that using
PrefBERT as the reward signal to train policy models yields responses better
aligned with human preferences than those trained with traditional metrics. Our
code is available at https://github.com/zli12321/long_form_rl.

### [9] [Learning-Time Encoding Shapes Unlearning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15076)
*Ruihan Wu,Konstantin Garov,Kamalika Chaudhuri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文实证研究表明：1) 使用同义描述训练可提升大模型遗忘性能；2) 从文本块中遗忘具体知识点存在挑战，提示学习阶段的知识编码方式对事后遗忘效果起关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大模型部署增多，基于隐私保护和修正有害/过时内容的需求，研究如何有效实现事后知识遗忘机制变得至关重要。

Method: 通过实验研究知识编码方式（如使用原句/同义句训练）对事实知识遗忘效果的影响，对比不同学习策略下的遗忘性能差异。

Result: 发现使用同义描述训练可使遗忘准确率提升约30%，但当多个知识点集中出现在同一文本段时，单点遗忘成功率不足50%。

Conclusion: 学习阶段的知识编码方式（如多样化表达训练）是构建可事后可靠遗忘模型的关键技术路径。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in the real world,
the ability to ``unlearn'', or remove specific pieces of knowledge post hoc,
has become essential for a variety of reasons ranging from privacy regulations
to correcting outdated or harmful content. Prior work has proposed unlearning
benchmarks and algorithms, and has typically assumed that the training process
and the target model are fixed. In this work, we empirically investigate how
learning-time choices in knowledge encoding impact the effectiveness of
unlearning factual knowledge. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1)
learning with paraphrased descriptions improves unlearning performance and (2)
unlearning individual piece of knowledge from a chunk of text is challenging.
Our results suggest that learning-time knowledge encoding may play a central
role in enabling reliable post-hoc unlearning.

*Yaxin Fan,Peifeng Li,Qiaoming Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出DCM澄清模块和CPO优化方法，有效解决对话语篇解析中的歧义问题，在STAC和Molweni数据集上显著超越现有基线


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对话中存在的省略、习语等语言特征会导致语篇关系歧义，传统解析器难以准确识别这类模糊关系

Method: 1. DCM模块通过澄清类型推理（分析语言特征）和语篇目标推理（区分歧义关系）双重机制；2. CPO机制评估澄清贡献并反馈优化DCM，形成闭环优化

Result: 在STAC和Molweni数据集上的实验显示，本方法比SOTA基线模型性能提升显著

Conclusion: DCM与CPO的协同机制有效解决对话语篇歧义，通过闭环优化提升解析器适应能力，为复杂对话分析提供新思路

Abstract: Dialogue discourse parsing aims to identify and analyze discourse relations
between the utterances within dialogues. However, linguistic features in
dialogues, such as omission and idiom, frequently introduce ambiguities that
obscure the intended discourse relations, posing significant challenges for
parsers. To address this issue, we propose a Discourse-aware Clarification
Module (DCM) to enhance the performance of the dialogue discourse parser. DCM
employs two distinct reasoning processes: clarification type reasoning and
discourse goal reasoning. The former analyzes linguistic features, while the
latter distinguishes the intended relation from the ambiguous one. Furthermore,
we introduce Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) to mitigate the
risk of erroneous clarifications, thereby reducing cascading errors. CPO
enables the parser to assess the contributions of the clarifications from DCM
and provide feedback to optimize the DCM, enhancing its adaptability and
alignment with the parser's requirements. Extensive experiments on the STAC and
Molweni datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively resolves ambiguities
and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有大语言模型在医学知识表示不足和临床部署效率低下两个关键问题

Method: 1. 基于医学知识增强数据微调Qwen2.5-7B作为教师模型
2. 通过多粒度注意力蒸馏机制生成可解释软标签
3. 将知识迁移至轻量级BERT学生模型

Result: 在MIMIC-III数据集上实现诊断准确率提升9%，F1分数提高27%，推理速度加快22.2倍

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升医疗资源利用效率，增强诊断准确性与时效性，为临床资源优化提供创新技术路径

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR)-based disease prediction models have
demonstrated significant clinical value in promoting precision medicine and
enabling early intervention. However, existing large language models face two
major challenges: insufficient representation of medical knowledge and low
efficiency in clinical deployment. To address these challenges, this study
proposes the CKD-EHR (Clinical Knowledge Distillation for EHR) framework, which
achieves efficient and accurate disease risk prediction through knowledge
distillation techniques. Specifically, the large language model Qwen2.5-7B is
first fine-tuned on medical knowledge-enhanced data to serve as the teacher
model.It then generates interpretable soft labels through a multi-granularity
attention distillation mechanism. Finally, the distilled knowledge is
transferred to a lightweight BERT student model. Experimental results show that
on the MIMIC-III dataset, CKD-EHR significantly outperforms the baseline
model:diagnostic accuracy is increased by 9%, F1-score is improved by 27%, and
a 22.2 times inference speedup is achieved. This innovative solution not only
greatly improves resource utilization efficiency but also significantly
enhances the accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis, providing a practical
technical approach for resource optimization in clinical settings. The code and
data for this research are available athttps://github.com/209506702/CKD_EHR.

TL;DR: 提出两阶段框架（MRG+PS）解决开放域对话的一对多特性，通过o2mDial语料库提升小模型响应多样性和质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型对话系统未充分利用对话上下文的一对多特性，导致响应多样性不足

Method: 将对话生成分解为多响应生成（MRG）和偏好选择（PS），构建o2mDial语料库，设计新的上下文学习策略和评估指标

Result: 小模型应用该框架后响应质量提升90%，在保持连贯性的同时接近大模型性能

Conclusion: 通过显式建模一对多特性，两阶段框架有效提升开放域对话系统的响应多样性和质量

Abstract: Open-domain Dialogue (OD) exhibits a one-to-many (o2m) property, whereby
multiple appropriate responses exist for a single dialogue context. Despite
prior research showing that modeling this property boosts response diversity,
most modern LLM-based dialogue agents do not explicitly do so. In this work, we
model the o2m property of OD in LLMs by decomposing OD generation into two key
tasks: Multi-Response Generation (MRG) and Preference-based Selection (PS),
which entail generating a set of n semantically and lexically diverse
high-quality responses for a given dialogue context, followed by selecting a
single response based on human preference, respectively. To facilitate MRG and
PS, we introduce o2mDial, a dialogue corpus explicitly designed to capture the
o2m property by featuring multiple plausible responses for each context.
Leveraging o2mDial, we propose new in-context learning and instruction-tuning
strategies, as well as novel evaluation metrics for MRG, alongside a
model-based approach for PS. Empirical results demonstrate that applying the
proposed two-stage framework to smaller LLMs for OD generation enhances overall
response diversity while maintaining contextual coherence, improving response
quality by up to 90%, bringing them closer to the performance of larger models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对韩语的语言结构特点，解决现有BPE分词器在韩语处理中token过长导致的效率问题

Method: 采用基于规则的预分词方法对齐语言结构，创建语言学单元种子词汇表，结合分支熵选择算法

Result: 相比BPE降低约10%的token数量(推理速度提升10%)，下游任务性能无损失

Conclusion: 基于语言学特征的分词器设计方法能有效平衡效率与性能，为语言模型提供实用解决方案

Abstract: This paper introduces Thunder-Tok, a new Korean tokenizer designed to reduce
token fertility without compromising model performance. Our approach uses a
rule-based pre-tokenization method that aligns with the linguistic structure of
the Korean language. We also create a seed vocabulary containing tokens that
resemble linguistic units and employ a branching entropy-based selection
algorithm. These techniques increase the average token length, thus lowering
fertility while preserving linguistic information. Experimental results
indicate that Thunder-Tok reduces fertility by approximately 10% (i.e., reduces
the number of tokens by 10%, improving the inference speed by 10%) compared to
BPE without compromising performance across various downstream tasks. These
findings demonstrate that our linguistically informed approach is effective and
practical for designing efficient tokenizers for language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过分析状态空间语言模型的记忆机制，揭示首因效应和近因效应的形成原理，为优化模型记忆能力提供理论依据。

Method: 在Mamba架构上应用结构化回忆任务，结合目标性消融实验和输入干扰测试（1.4B/7B参数模型验证）。

Result: 发现三种核心机制：1）稀疏通道持续编码早期token 2）Delta调制导致近因效应但易受干扰 3）语义重复关系改变遗忘模式。

Conclusion: Mamba模型的U型记忆曲线是长/短期记忆机制与语义动态调节共同作用的结果，经大规模模型实验验证具有普适性。

Abstract: We study memory in state-space language models using primacy and recency
effects as behavioral tools to uncover how information is retained and
forgotten over time. Applying structured recall tasks to the Mamba
architecture, we observe a consistent U-shaped accuracy profile, indicating
strong performance at the beginning and end of input sequences. We identify
three mechanisms that give rise to this pattern. First, long-term memory is
supported by a sparse subset of channels within the model's selective state
space block, which persistently encode early input tokens and are causally
linked to primacy effects. Second, short-term memory is governed by
delta-modulated recurrence: recent inputs receive more weight due to
exponential decay, but this recency advantage collapses when distractor items
are introduced, revealing a clear limit to memory depth. Third, we find that
memory allocation is dynamically modulated by semantic regularity: repeated
relations in the input sequence shift the delta gating behavior, increasing the
tendency to forget intermediate items. We validate these findings via targeted
ablations and input perturbations on two large-scale Mamba-based language
models: one with 1.4B and another with 7B parameters.

Motivation: 追踪SDGs进展面临数据规模庞大且复杂的挑战，需探索大型语言模型在文本分类任务中的潜力及其优化方法

Method: 通过比较专有/开源LLMs模型，评估零样本学习、少样本学习和微调三种任务适应技术在SDGs单标签多分类任务中的有效性

Result: 优化提示工程的小型模型与GPT等大型模型表现相当，证明模型规模并非性能提升的唯一途径

Conclusion: 合理运用提示工程技术可使资源消耗更低的小型模型达到实用效果，为可持续发展目标监测提供高效解决方案

Abstract: In 2012, the United Nations introduced 17 Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs) aimed at creating a more sustainable and improved future by 2030.
However, tracking progress toward these goals is difficult because of the
extensive scale and complexity of the data involved. Text classification models
have become vital tools in this area, automating the analysis of vast amounts
of text from a variety of sources. Additionally, large language models (LLMs)
have recently proven indispensable for many natural language processing tasks,
including text classification, thanks to their ability to recognize complex
linguistic patterns and semantics. This study analyzes various proprietary and
open-source LLMs for a single-label, multi-class text classification task
focused on the SDGs. Then, it also evaluates the effectiveness of task
adaptation techniques (i.e., in-context learning approaches), namely Zero-Shot
and Few-Shot Learning, as well as Fine-Tuning within this domain. The results
reveal that smaller models, when optimized through prompt engineering, can
perform on par with larger models like OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained
Transformer).

TL;DR: ProtoReasoning框架通过抽象推理原型(Prolog/PDDL)增强大语言模型的跨领域推理能力，在多项任务中实现性能提升并验证结构泛化假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大型推理模型跨领域泛化机制，假设其源于共享的抽象推理原型，需验证原型空间训练的有效性。

Method: 提出包含自动原型构建、验证系统和原型空间扩展的三阶段框架，将问题转化为形式化推理原型进行训练。

Result: 逻辑推理提升4.7%，规划任务提升6.3%，MMLU提升4.0%，数学推理提升1.0%，消融实验证实结构相似问题泛化优势。

Conclusion: 验证了推理原型作为可泛化基础的理论，证明原型空间训练相比自然语言表示更具结构泛化优势。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) trained with Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) reasoning have demonstrated remarkable cross-domain
generalization capabilities. However, the underlying mechanisms supporting such
transfer remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that cross-domain
generalization arises from shared abstract reasoning prototypes -- fundamental
reasoning patterns that capture the essence of problems across domains. These
prototypes minimize the nuances of the representation, revealing that seemingly
diverse tasks are grounded in shared reasoning structures.Based on this
hypothesis, we propose ProtoReasoning, a framework that enhances the reasoning
ability of LLMs by leveraging scalable and verifiable prototypical
representations (Prolog for logical reasoning, PDDL for
planning).ProtoReasoning features: (1) an automated prototype construction
pipeline that transforms problems into corresponding prototype representations;
(2) a comprehensive verification system providing reliable feedback through
Prolog/PDDL interpreters; (3) the scalability to synthesize problems
arbitrarily within prototype space while ensuring correctness. Extensive
experiments show that ProtoReasoning achieves 4.7% improvement over baseline
models on logical reasoning (Enigmata-Eval), 6.3% improvement on planning
tasks, 4.0% improvement on general reasoning (MMLU) and 1.0% on mathematics
(AIME24). Significantly, our ablation studies confirm that learning in
prototype space also demonstrates enhanced generalization to structurally
similar problems compared to training solely on natural language
representations, validating our hypothesis that reasoning prototypes serve as
the foundation for generalizable reasoning in large language models.

*Yongqi Fan,Yating Wang,Guandong Wang,Jie Zhai,Jingping Liu,Qi Ye,Tong Ruan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出MinosEval评估方法，针对开放QA问题采用factoid/non-factoid双路径评估策略


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标(如ROUGE)难以捕捉语义差异，LLM评估方法缺乏跨问题适应性且忽视问题类型差异

Method: 先区分问题类型：factoid问题使用自适应关键点评分，non-factoid问题采用实例感知列表排序

Result: 在多个开放QA数据集(含自建数据集)上验证，评估结果更贴合人工判断且具可解释性

Conclusion: 通过问题类型区分和差异化评估策略，实现了更精准可靠的开放QA自动评估

Abstract: Open-ended question answering (QA) is a key task for evaluating the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Compared to closed-ended QA, it
demands longer answer statements, more nuanced reasoning processes, and diverse
expressions, making refined and interpretable automatic evaluation both crucial
and challenging. Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore struggle to
capture semantic similarities due to different patterns between model responses
and reference answers. Current LLM-based evaluation approaches, such as
pairwise or listwise comparisons of candidate answers, lack intuitive
interpretability. While pointwise scoring of each response provides some
descriptions, it fails to adapt across different question contents. Most
notably, existing methods overlook the distinction between factoid and
non-factoid questions. To address these challenges, we propose
\textbf{MinosEval}, a novel evaluation method that first distinguishes
open-ended questions and then ranks candidate answers using different
evaluation strategies. For factoid questions, it applies an adaptive key-point
scoring strategy, while for non-factoid questions, it uses an instance-aware
listwise ranking strategy. Experiments on multiple open-ended QA datasets,
including self-built ones with more candidate responses to complement community
resources, show that MinosEval better aligns with human annotations and offers
more interpretable results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证语言模型对非标准语言变体的理解能力，特别是巴斯克语这种资源匮乏语言及其方言

Method: 使用自然语言推理(NLI)任务，构建巴斯克语-西班牙语平行数据集，通过跨语言学习和上下文学习实验（编码器模型和基于解码器的LLMs）

Result: 1. 语言变异导致模型性能下降（非词汇因素）
2. 编码器模型在西部巴斯克语表现最差（符合边缘方言与标准语差异更大的语言学理论）

Conclusion: 语言技术需特别关注边缘语言变体处理，公开数据集为后续研究提供基准

Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of current language technologies to
understand Basque and Spanish language varieties. We use Natural Language
Inference (NLI) as a pivot task and introduce a novel, manually-curated
parallel dataset in Basque and Spanish, along with their respective variants.
Our empirical analysis of crosslingual and in-context learning experiments
using encoder-only and decoder-based Large Language Models (LLMs) shows a
performance drop when handling linguistic variation, especially in Basque.
Error analysis suggests that this decline is not due to lexical overlap, but
rather to the linguistic variation itself. Further ablation experiments
indicate that encoder-only models particularly struggle with Western Basque,
which aligns with linguistic theory that identifies peripheral dialects (e.g.,
Western) as more distant from the standard. All data and code are publicly
available.

Conclusion: 该框架为经典文本知识提取提供了低资源解决方案，推动了历史知识服务数字化和人文研究发展

Abstract: This article addresses domain knowledge gaps in general large language models
for historical text analysis in the context of computational humanities and
AIGC technology. We propose the Graph RAG framework, combining chain-of-thought
prompting, self-instruction generation, and process supervision to create a The
First Four Histories character relationship dataset with minimal manual
annotation. This dataset supports automated historical knowledge extraction,
reducing labor costs. In the graph-augmented generation phase, we introduce a
collaborative mechanism between knowledge graphs and retrieval-augmented
generation, improving the alignment of general models with historical
knowledge. Experiments show that the domain-specific model Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B,
with Simplified Chinese input and chain-of-thought prompting, achieves optimal
performance in relation extraction (F1 = 0.68). The DeepSeek model integrated
with GraphRAG improves F1 by 11% (0.08-0.19) on the open-domain C-CLUE relation
extraction dataset, surpassing the F1 value of Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B (0.12),
effectively alleviating hallucinations phenomenon, and improving
interpretability. This framework offers a low-resource solution for classical
text knowledge extraction, advancing historical knowledge services and
humanities research.

Abstract: We present TopClustRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system
developed for the LiveRAG Challenge, which evaluates end-to-end question
answering over large-scale web corpora. Our system employs a hybrid retrieval
strategy combining sparse and dense indices, followed by K-Means clustering to
group semantically similar passages. Representative passages from each cluster
are used to construct cluster-specific prompts for a large language model
(LLM), generating intermediate answers that are filtered, reranked, and finally
synthesized into a single, comprehensive response. This multi-stage pipeline
enhances answer diversity, relevance, and faithfulness to retrieved evidence.
Evaluated on the FineWeb Sample-10BT dataset, TopClustRAG ranked 2nd in
faithfulness and 7th in correctness on the official leaderboard, demonstrating
the effectiveness of clustering-based context filtering and prompt aggregation
in large-scale RAG systems.

TL;DR: Thunder-DeID框架通过构建首个韩语法律标注数据集、系统化PII分类和端到端深度学习流程，实现韩国法院判决的高效合规去标识化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有法院判决去标识化方法无法满足大规模处理需求，且法律定义模糊导致技术适配困难，需平衡司法公开与隐私保护。

Method: 1. 构建带实体标注的韩语判决数据集
2. 建立系统化的PII分类体系
3. 开发基于深度神经网络的端到端去标识化流程

Result: 实验表明该模型在法院判决去标识化任务中达到当前最优性能指标（SOTA）

Conclusion: Thunder-DeID成功将法律规范与技术方案结合，提升处理效率的同时发布首个韩语法律资源，推动合规自动化发展。

Abstract: To ensure a balance between open access to justice and personal data
protection, the South Korean judiciary mandates the de-identification of court
judgments before they can be publicly disclosed. However, the current
de-identification process is inadequate for handling court judgments at scale
while adhering to strict legal requirements. Additionally, the legal
definitions and categorizations of personal identifiers are vague and not
well-suited for technical solutions. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
de-identification framework called Thunder-DeID, which aligns with relevant
laws and practices. Specifically, we (i) construct and release the first Korean
legal dataset containing annotated judgments along with corresponding lists of
entity mentions, (ii) introduce a systematic categorization of Personally
Identifiable Information (PII), and (iii) develop an end-to-end deep neural
network (DNN)-based de-identification pipeline. Our experimental results
demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in the
de-identification of court judgments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床试验设计依赖自然语言描述，患者数据包含结构化与非结构化文本，传统方法局限于特定试验，LLMs的知识整合能力有望构建通用解决方案。但当前LLM应用存在依赖闭源模型和评估体系不完善的问题。

Method: 通过系统梳理试验-患者匹配任务，对比分析基于LLM的新兴方法，批判性评估现有基准测试、技术框架及临床应用挑战。

Result: 发现当前LLM应用存在三大瓶颈：1）过度依赖商业模型 2）评估基准缺乏临床有效性 3）忽视医疗伦理要求。

Conclusion: 未来应重点发展：医疗领域专用LLM、基于真实临床场景的评估框架、符合医疗合规要求的模型优化技术，以及多模态数据处理能力提升。

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have greatly improved general-domain NLP tasks. Yet,
their adoption in critical domains, such as clinical trial recruitment, remains
limited. As trials are designed in natural language and patient data is
represented as both structured and unstructured text, the task of matching
trials and patients benefits from knowledge aggregation and reasoning abilities
of LLMs. Classical approaches are trial-specific and LLMs with their ability to
consolidate distributed knowledge hold the potential to build a more general
solution. Yet recent applications of LLM-assisted methods rely on proprietary
models and weak evaluation benchmarks. In this survey, we are the first to
analyze the task of trial-patient matching and contextualize emerging LLM-based
approaches in clinical trial recruitment. We critically examine existing
benchmarks, approaches and evaluation frameworks, the challenges to adopting
LLM technologies in clinical research and exciting future directions.

Motivation: 解决传统语言识别模型在低资源语言上面临的类别不平衡和数据领域单一问题（如仅使用圣经等单领域数据），提出领域不变表征学习方法

Method: 设计监督对比学习框架（SCL），学习低资源语言的领域不变表征

Result: 在跨领域测试数据上将低资源语言识别准确率提升3.2%

Conclusion: 验证了监督对比学习方法在改善语言识别模型领域泛化能力方面的有效性

Abstract: Language identification (LID) is a critical step in curating multilingual LLM
pretraining corpora from web crawls. While many studies on LID model training
focus on collecting diverse training data to improve performance, low-resource
languages -- often limited to single-domain data, such as the Bible -- continue
to perform poorly. To resolve these class imbalance and bias issues, we propose
a novel supervised contrastive learning (SCL) approach to learn
domain-invariant representations for low-resource languages. Through an
extensive analysis, we show that our approach improves LID performance on
out-of-domain data for low-resource languages by 3.2%, demonstrating its
effectiveness in enhancing LID models.

Motivation: 现有临床LLM评估方法难以区分真实医学推理与表面模式，需开发细粒度行为测试框架揭示模型决策机制

Method: 基于MIMIC-IV构建真实/模板化ICU出院记录数据集，控制人口统计(年龄/性别/种族)和生命体征变量，评估5个LLM在零样本/微调设置下的输入敏感性和住院时长预测表现

Result: 零样本模型counterfactual推理模式更连贯，微调模型稳定性提升但对临床重要变化响应下降；人口因素对预测结果存在系统性微妙影响

Conclusion: 行为测试能有效暴露临床LLM的推理策略，强调公平性评估的重要性，为构建更安全透明的医疗AI系统提供方法论支持

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical decision
support, yet current evaluation methods often fail to distinguish genuine
medical reasoning from superficial patterns. We introduce DeVisE (Demographics
and Vital signs Evaluation), a behavioral testing framework for probing
fine-grained clinical understanding. We construct a dataset of ICU discharge
notes from MIMIC-IV, generating both raw (real-world) and template-based
(synthetic) versions with controlled single-variable counterfactuals targeting
demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and vital sign attributes. We evaluate
five LLMs spanning general-purpose and medically fine-tuned variants, under
both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We assess model behavior via (1)
input-level sensitivity - how counterfactuals alter the likelihood of a note;
and (2) downstream reasoning - how they affect predicted hospital
length-of-stay. Our results show that zero-shot models exhibit more coherent
counterfactual reasoning patterns, while fine-tuned models tend to be more
stable yet less responsive to clinically meaningful changes. Notably,
demographic factors subtly but consistently influence outputs, emphasizing the
importance of fairness-aware evaluation. This work highlights the utility of
behavioral testing in exposing the reasoning strategies of clinical LLMs and
informing the design of safer, more transparent medical AI systems.

Motivation: 现有语言模型在全球应用中的有效性依赖于对本土社会文化语境的理解，而印度作为文化超级大国缺乏针对性评估工具

Method: 构建包含21,853个问答对的数据集，覆盖印度28个邦和8个联邦属地，涉及16个核心文化维度（仪式、历史、饮食、艺术等）

Result: 主流大模型、印度本地模型和小型模型在文化敏感性查询处理上存在显著差异，多数模型难以应对区域特定语境

Conclusion: SANSKRITI通过提供广博的文化多样性数据集，为评估和改进语言模型的文化理解能力设立新基准

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are indispensable tools shaping modern workflows, but
their global effectiveness depends on understanding local socio-cultural
contexts. To address this, we introduce SANSKRITI, a benchmark designed to
evaluate language models' comprehension of India's rich cultural diversity.
Comprising 21,853 meticulously curated question-answer pairs spanning 28 states
and 8 union territories, SANSKRITI is the largest dataset for testing Indian
cultural knowledge. It covers sixteen key attributes of Indian culture: rituals
and ceremonies, history, tourism, cuisine, dance and music, costume, language,
art, festivals, religion, medicine, transport, sports, nightlife, and
personalities, providing a comprehensive representation of India's cultural
tapestry. We evaluate SANSKRITI on leading Large Language Models (LLMs), Indic
Language Models (ILMs), and Small Language Models (SLMs), revealing significant
disparities in their ability to handle culturally nuanced queries, with many
models struggling in region-specific contexts. By offering an extensive,
culturally rich, and diverse dataset, SANSKRITI sets a new standard for
assessing and improving the cultural understanding of LMs.

Conclusion: COSMMIC通过三模态整合突破传统单模态局限，推动印度语言NLP研究的包容性发展。

Abstract: Despite progress in comment-aware multimodal and multilingual summarization
for English and Chinese, research in Indian languages remains limited. This
study addresses this gap by introducing COSMMIC, a pioneering comment-sensitive
multimodal, multilingual dataset featuring nine major Indian languages. COSMMIC
comprises 4,959 article-image pairs and 24,484 reader comments, with
ground-truth summaries available in all included languages. Our approach
enhances summaries by integrating reader insights and feedback. We explore
summarization and headline generation across four configurations: (1) using
article text alone, (2) incorporating user comments, (3) utilizing images, and
(4) combining text, comments, and images. To assess the dataset's
effectiveness, we employ state-of-the-art language models such as LLama3 and
GPT-4. We conduct a comprehensive study to evaluate different component
combinations, including identifying supportive comments, filtering out noise
using a dedicated comment classifier using IndicBERT, and extracting valuable
insights from images with a multilingual CLIP-based classifier. This helps
determine the most effective configurations for natural language generation
(NLG) tasks. Unlike many existing datasets that are either text-only or lack
user comments in multimodal settings, COSMMIC uniquely integrates text, images,
and user feedback. This holistic approach bridges gaps in Indian language
resources, advancing NLP research and fostering inclusivity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在低资源语言（如斯瓦希里语）的跨语言词汇对齐表现欠佳，尽管内部早期层存在完美对齐潜力但未能有效传导至输出层

Method: 使用LoRA和对比学习对Lugha-Llama模型的第二层（最优对齐层）进行参数高效微调

Result: 训练集词汇相似度提升28.08%，未见过词汇相似度提升28.32%，p值均达统计显著性

Conclusion: TLI有效激活模型早期层跨语言知识，为低资源语言LLM优化提供高效解决方案

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
their performance in low-resource languages (LRLs), such as Swahili, often lags
due to data scarcity and underrepresentation in pre-training. A key challenge
is achieving robust cross-lingual lexical alignment, crucial for tasks like
translation and cross-lingual information retrieval. This paper introduces
Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a novel and efficient fine-tuning approach.
We first demonstrate that Lugha-Llama-8B-wura, a Swahili-centric LLM, exhibits
strong, near-perfect lexical alignment for Swahili-English word pairs in its
early internal layers (specifically Layer 2, with ~0.99998 average cosine
similarity based on a pilot study), a capability not fully reflected in its
final output representations (baseline ~0.32 similarity on our evaluation set).
TLI leverages this insight by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a
contrastive learning objective to fine-tune the model, specifically targeting
embeddings from this empirically identified optimal early layer. Our
experiments show that TLI significantly improves the output-level lexical
alignment for 623 trained Swahili-English word pairs, increasing average cosine
similarity from 0.3211 to 0.4113 (+28.08%, p < 1.33 x 10^-240). More
importantly, these improvements generalize remarkably well to 63 unseen control
word pairs, with similarity increasing from 0.3143 to 0.4033 (+28.32%, p < 7.17
x 10^-27). These findings suggest TLI enhances the model's ability to preserve
and propagate its inherent early-layer cross-lingual knowledge, offering a
parameter-efficient and effective strategy for improving lexical alignment in
LRL-focused LLMs.

Conclusion: 研究通过创新评估体系和训练优化方法，为解决GUI代理定位幻觉问题提供了新思路，推动了人机交互可靠性的发展

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled GUI agents to interact
with operating systems by grounding language into spatial actions. Despite
their promising performance, these models frequently exhibit
hallucinations-systematic localization errors that compromise reliability. We
propose a fine-grained evaluation framework that categorizes model predictions
into four distinct types, revealing nuanced failure modes beyond traditional
accuracy metrics. To better quantify model uncertainty, we introduce the Peak
Sharpness Score (PSS), a metric that evaluates the alignment between semantic
continuity and logits distribution in coordinate prediction. Building on this
insight, we further propose Context-Aware Cropping, a training-free technique
that improves model performance by adaptively refining input context. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework and methods provide actionable
insights and enhance the interpretability and robustness of GUI agent behavior.

Abstract: Large language model based multi-agent systems have demonstrated significant
potential in social simulation and complex task resolution domains. However,
current frameworks face critical challenges in system architecture design,
cross-domain generalizability, and performance guarantees, particularly as task
complexity and number of agents increases. We introduces AgentGroupChat-V2, a
novel framework addressing these challenges through three core innovations: (1)
a divide-and-conquer fully parallel architecture that decomposes user queries
into hierarchical task forest structures enabling dependency management and
distributed concurrent processing. (2) an adaptive collaboration engine that
dynamically selects heterogeneous LLM combinations and interaction modes based
on task characteristics. (3) agent organization optimization strategies
combining divide-and-conquer approaches for efficient problem decomposition.
Extensive experiments demonstrate AgentGroupChat-V2's superior performance
across diverse domains, achieving 91.50% accuracy on GSM8K (exceeding the best

TL;DR: 论文提出RE-IMAGINE框架，通过生成不同层次因果关系的变体问题评估大语言模型的真实推理能力，发现模型过度依赖统计记忆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大语言模型在推理任务中的表现是源自真实逻辑推理能力，还是对训练数据的统计记忆，基于Pearl因果阶梯理论建立评估体系。

Method: 开发自动化流程RE-IMAGINE，通过中间符号表示生成数学/代码/逻辑等领域的变体问题，突破单纯记忆可解的范畴。

Result: 测试多个LLM家族发现，当面对问题变体时模型性能显著下降，验证其存在统计记忆依赖。

Conclusion: 当前LLM的推理能力仍受限于统计记忆，需针对因果阶梯不同层级的推理技能开展系统性研究。

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have reported high accuracy on reasoning
benchmarks. However, it is still unclear whether the observed results arise
from true reasoning or from statistical recall of the training set. Inspired by
the ladder of causation (Pearl, 2009) and its three levels (associations,
interventions and counterfactuals), this paper introduces RE-IMAGINE, a
framework to characterize a hierarchy of reasoning ability in LLMs, alongside
an automated pipeline to generate problem variations at different levels of the
hierarchy. By altering problems in an intermediate symbolic representation,
RE-IMAGINE generates arbitrarily many problems that are not solvable using
memorization alone. Moreover, the framework is general and can work across
reasoning domains, including math, code, and logic. We demonstrate our
framework on four widely-used benchmarks to evaluate several families of LLMs,
and observe reductions in performance when the models are queried with problem
variations. These assessments indicate a degree of reliance on statistical
recall for past performance, and open the door to further research targeting
skills across the reasoning hierarchy.

TL;DR: 提出CINGS训练方法，通过将相关上下文前置并仅计算响应部分损失，有效提升大语言模型基于外部知识的生成能力，减少幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在推理时简单附加上下文无法确保生成结果准确性，需开发更有效的训练监督机制增强模型对上下文的依赖。

Method: 后训练阶段将相关上下文置于响应前，仅对响应token计算交叉熵损失并掩蔽上下文部分，强制模型学习基于上下文的生成模式。

Result: 文本领域在11个数据集超越其他方法，视觉领域替换LLM骨干后幻觉减少45%且保持下游任务性能，实现精度与稳定性的双重提升。

Conclusion: CINGS通过改变模型先验知识分布，隐式建立上下文与生成结果的强关联机制，为多模态场景提供通用可靠的训练范式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often supplemented with external knowledge
to provide information not encoded in their parameters or to reduce
hallucination. In such cases, we expect the model to generate responses by
grounding its response in the provided external context. However, prior work
has shown that simply appending context at inference time does not ensure
grounded generation. To address this, we propose Context-INformed Grounding
Supervision (CINGS), a post-training supervision in which the model is trained
with relevant context prepended to the response, while computing the loss only
over the response tokens and masking out the context. Our experiments
demonstrate that models trained with CINGS exhibit stronger grounding in both
textual and visual domains compared to standard instruction-tuned models. In
the text domain, CINGS outperforms other training methods across 11
information-seeking datasets and is complementary to inference-time grounding
techniques. In the vision-language domain, replacing a vision-language model's
LLM backbone with a CINGS-trained model reduces hallucinations across four
benchmarks and maintains factual consistency throughout the generated response.
This improved grounding comes without degradation in general downstream
performance. Finally, we analyze the mechanism underlying the enhanced
grounding in CINGS and find that it induces a shift in the model's prior
knowledge and behavior, implicitly encouraging greater reliance on the external
context.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型的逐步监督标注方法存在效率低和质量不稳定问题，需要开发更高效的自动化流程标注框架

Method: 基于参考解的步骤对齐机制（SPARE框架），通过离线强化学习微调和奖励模型训练两种方式，实现单步标注与显式推理评估

Result: 相比基线方法推理性能提升，运行时间减少62%（效率提升2.6倍），在数学推理数据集上保持竞争力

Conclusion: SPARE框架为复杂推理任务提供了更高效的自动标注替代方案，同时开源代码库和训练模型促进研究复现

Abstract: Process or step-wise supervision has played a crucial role in advancing
complex multi-step reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, efficient, high-quality automated process annotation remains a
significant challenge. To address this, we introduce Single-Pass Annotation
with Reference-Guided Evaluation (SPARE), a novel structured framework that
enables single-pass, per-step annotation by aligning each solution step to one
or multiple steps in a reference solution, accompanied by explicit reasoning
for evaluation. We show that reference-guided step-level evaluation effectively
facilitates process supervision on four datasets spanning three domains:
mathematical reasoning, multi-hop compositional question answering, and spatial
reasoning. We demonstrate that SPARE, when compared to baselines, improves
reasoning performance when used for: (1) fine-tuning models in an offline RL
setup for inference-time greedy-decoding, and (2) training reward models for
ranking/aggregating multiple LLM-generated outputs. Additionally, SPARE
achieves competitive performance on challenging mathematical datasets while
offering 2.6 times greater efficiency, requiring only 38% of the runtime,
compared to tree search-based automatic annotation. The codebase, along with a
trained SPARE-PRM model, is publicly released to facilitate further research
and reproducibility.

Motivation: 现有方法忽视夸张与隐喻的关联性及隐含情感对修辞感知的影响，导致检测效果受限。本文旨在通过情感分析和领域映射解决语义隐晦问题

Method: 1.情感分析模块挖掘修辞隐含情感 → 2.领域映射模块解析目标域/源域 → 3.双向动态交互模块实现夸张与隐喻相互增强 → 4.验证机制确保检测可靠性

Result: TroFi数据集夸张检测F1提升28.1%，HYPO-L数据集隐喻检测F1提升23.1%，在四个基准测试中全面超越现有SOTA方法

Conclusion: EmoBi框架通过情感引导与动态交互机制，有效提升复杂修辞检测性能，实验证明其在语义深度解析方面的创新价值与应用潜力

Abstract: Text-based hyperbole and metaphor detection are of great significance for
natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, due to their semantic
obscurity and expressive diversity, it is rather challenging to identify them.
Existing methods mostly focus on superficial text features, ignoring the
associations of hyperbole and metaphor as well as the effect of implicit
emotion on perceiving these rhetorical devices. To implement these hypotheses,
we propose an emotion-guided hyperbole and metaphor detection framework based
on bidirectional dynamic interaction (EmoBi). Firstly, the emotion analysis
module deeply mines the emotion connotations behind hyperbole and metaphor.
Next, the emotion-based domain mapping module identifies the target and source
domains to gain a deeper understanding of the implicit meanings of hyperbole
and metaphor. Finally, the bidirectional dynamic interaction module enables the
mutual promotion between hyperbole and metaphor. Meanwhile, a verification
mechanism is designed to ensure detection accuracy and reliability. Experiments
show that EmoBi outperforms all baseline methods on four datasets.
Specifically, compared to the current SoTA, the F1 score increased by 28.1% for
hyperbole detection on the TroFi dataset and 23.1% for metaphor detection on
the HYPO-L dataset. These results, underpinned by in-depth analyses, underscore
the effectiveness and potential of our approach for advancing hyperbole and
metaphor detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索增强生成(RAG)方法存在遗漏答案、错误引用和不当拒绝的问题，需要更有效的模型优化方案。

Method: 采用GRPO强化学习方法，通过两阶段训练（先优化答案和引用，后优化拒绝机制），结合GPT-4蒸馏的指令微调。

Result: 在ASQA等四个数据集上，推理增强模型全面超越纯指令微调模型，正确率最高提升75%，引用充分性提高30%。

Conclusion: 阶段式优化、结果驱动的强化学习与推理机制结合，是构建可验证、可靠语言模型的有效路径。

Abstract: Generating grounded and trustworthy responses remains a key challenge for
large language models (LLMs). While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with
citation-based grounding holds promise, instruction-tuned models frequently
fail even in straightforward scenarios: missing explicitly stated answers,
citing incorrectly, or refusing when evidence is available. In this work, we
explore how reinforcement learning (RL) and internal reasoning can enhance
grounding in LLMs. We use the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) method
to train models using verifiable outcome-based rewards targeting answer
correctness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality, without requiring gold
reasoning traces or expensive annotations. Through comprehensive experiments
across ASQA, QAMPARI, ELI5, and ExpertQA we show that reasoning-augmented
models significantly outperform instruction-only variants, especially in
handling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses. A two-stage
training setup, first optimizing answer and citation behavior and then refusal,
further improves grounding by stabilizing the learning signal. Additionally, we
revisit instruction tuning via GPT-4 distillation and find that combining it
with GRPO enhances performance on long-form, generative QA tasks. Overall, our
findings highlight the value of reasoning, stage-wise optimization, and
outcome-driven RL for building more verifiable and reliable LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出RATTENTION方法，通过局部注意力与线性注意力结合，在保持性能的同时显著提升效率（512窗口媲美全注意力），并增强长上下文处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决局部注意力模型窗口大小的帕累托困境：大窗口效率低，小窗口性能差。核心突破在于捕捉窗口外token的信息。

Method: RATTENTION = 局部注意力 + 专用线性注意力机制，线性部分专注捕获窗口外token的全局信息。

Result: 3B/12B预训练显示：512窗口实现全注意力性能，RULER长上下文任务提升，训练速度与SOTA相当（专用内核支持）。

Conclusion: RATTENTION突破传统效率-性能权衡，在极小窗口下实现高效推理（短上下文）与增强的长期记忆（长上下文），且不牺牲训练效率。

Abstract: Local-global attention models have recently emerged as compelling
alternatives to standard Transformers, promising improvements in both training
and inference efficiency. However, the crucial choice of window size presents a
Pareto tradeoff: larger windows maintain performance akin to full attention but
offer minimal efficiency gains in short-context scenarios, while smaller
windows can lead to performance degradation. Current models, such as Gemma2 and
Mistral, adopt conservative window sizes (e.g., 4096 out of an 8192 pretraining
length) to preserve performance. This work investigates strategies to shift
this Pareto frontier, enabling local-global models to achieve efficiency gains
even in short-context regimes. Our core motivation is to address the intrinsic
limitation of local attention -- its complete disregard for tokens outside the
defined window. We explore RATTENTION, a variant of local attention integrated
with a specialized linear attention mechanism designed to capture information
from these out-of-window tokens. Pretraining experiments at the 3B and 12B
scales demonstrate that RATTENTION achieves a superior Pareto tradeoff between
performance and efficiency. As a sweet spot, RATTENTION with a window size of
just 512 consistently matches the performance of full-attention models across
diverse settings. Furthermore, the recurrent nature inherent in the linear
attention component of RATTENTION contributes to enhanced long-context
performance, as validated on the RULER benchmark. Crucially, these improvements
do not compromise training efficiency; thanks to a specialized kernel
implementation and the reduced window size, RATTENTION maintains training
speeds comparable to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Method: 开发梯度匹配算法，从大规模公共语料中自动筛选与原始模型权重最匹配的文档子集用于再训练

Result: 在AG News分类任务准确率提升15%(80% vs 65%)，MSMARCO SFT任务困惑度降低1.0(2.3 vs 3.3)，接近专家模型表现

Conclusion: 该方法为数据不可见场景下的模型复现提供了有效解决方案，证实公共数据筛选可逼近原始训练效果

Abstract: Modern language models often have open weights but closed training data. We
formalize the problem of data approximation from model weights and propose
several baselines and metrics. We develop a gradient-based approach that
selects the highest-matching data from a large public text corpus and show its
effectiveness at recovering useful data given only weights of the original and
finetuned models. Even when none of the true training data is known, our method
is able to locate a small subset of public Web documents can be used to train a
model to close to the original model performance given models trained for both
classification and supervised-finetuning. On the AG News classification task,
our method improves performance from 65% (using randomly selected data) to 80%,
approaching the expert benchmark of 88%. When applied to a model trained with
SFT on MSMARCO web documents, our method reduces perplexity from 3.3 to 2.3,
compared to an expert LLAMA model's perplexity of 2.0.

<details>

Motivation: 现有LLM在实时语音交互中生成首句的延迟过高，导致TTS系统无法及时合成音频，影响单用户硬件设备的实时交互体验

Method: 采用预测生成框架(PredGen)，在用户说话时同步生成候选响应，实现TTS处理的提前启动

Result: 在Lmsys和MT-Bench数据集模拟实验中，延迟降低约2倍，输入阶段仅增加微量计算成本

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了实时语音交互系统的响应延迟问题，且计算资源利用率高，具有实际部署价值

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in real-time voice chat
applications, typically in combination with text-to-speech (TTS) systems to
generate audio responses. However, their large size often leads to noticeable
latency between the end of user input and the start of audio output, resulting
in suboptimal user experiences. This latency is particularly evident when LLMs
are deployed as single-user voice assistants on consumer-grade hardware with
limited computing capacity. We discovered that this latency is primarily
dominated by the time it takes for the LLMs to generate the first sentence,
which is required as input by the TTS systems that synthesize audio responses
on a sentence-by-sentence basis. To address this bottleneck, we propose
Predictive Generation (PredGen), a novel framework that mitigates-or even
eliminates-this delay through speculative decoding at input time. PredGen
generates candidate responses while the user is still speaking, enabling the
system to begin TTS processing with minimal delay. Simulated experiments on the
Lmsys and MT-Bench datasets show that the proposed method can effectively
reduce the latency by around 2x across a wide range of use cases, while
incurring only minimal additional computation cost at input time-computation
that would otherwise go unused.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of gender fairness in large language
models (LLMs), focusing on their ability to handle both binary and non-binary
genders. While previous studies primarily focus on binary gender distinctions,
we introduce the Gender Inclusivity Fairness Index (GIFI), a novel and
comprehensive metric that quantifies the diverse gender inclusivity of LLMs.
GIFI consists of a wide range of evaluations at different levels, from simply
probing the model with respect to provided gender pronouns to testing various
aspects of model generation and cognitive behaviors under different gender
assumptions, revealing biases associated with varying gender identifiers. We
conduct extensive evaluations with GIFI on 22 prominent open-source and
proprietary LLMs of varying sizes and capabilities, discovering significant
variations in LLMs' gender inclusivity. Our study highlights the importance of
improving LLMs' inclusivity, providing a critical benchmark for future
advancements in gender fairness in generative models.

Method: 构建包含8,830样本的多句场景图数据集，设计双阶段精炼框架（基于Flan-T5-Base模型的草稿生成+迭代编辑机制）

Result: SPICE指标提升30%，推理速度较GPT-4快86倍，在描述评估和幻觉检测等下游任务中表现提升

Conclusion: DiscoSG-Refiner为开放场景下的多句场景图解析提供了高效解决方案，平衡了性能与计算成本

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) now generate discourse-level, multi-sentence
visual descriptions, challenging text scene graph parsers originally designed
for single-sentence caption-to-graph mapping. Current approaches typically
merge sentence-level parsing outputs for discourse input, often missing
phenomena like cross-sentence coreference, resulting in fragmented graphs and
degraded downstream VLM task performance. To address this, we introduce a new
task, Discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing (DiscoSG), supported by our
dataset DiscoSG-DS, which comprises 400 expert-annotated and 8,430 synthesised
multi-sentence caption-graph pairs for images. Each caption averages 9
sentences, and each graph contains at least 3 times more triples than those in
existing datasets. While fine-tuning large PLMs (i.e., GPT-4) on DiscoSG-DS
improves SPICE by approximately 48% over the best sentence-merging baseline,
high inference cost and restrictive licensing hinder its open-source use, and
smaller fine-tuned PLMs struggle with complex graphs. We propose
DiscoSG-Refiner, which drafts a base graph using one small PLM, then employs a
second PLM to iteratively propose graph edits, reducing full-graph generation
overhead. Using two Flan-T5-Base models, DiscoSG-Refiner still improves SPICE
by approximately 30% over the best baseline while achieving 86 times faster
inference than GPT-4. It also consistently improves downstream VLM tasks like
discourse-level caption evaluation and hallucination detection. Code and data

Method: 构建包含1000个多选题的WikiMixQA数据集，覆盖7个主题的4000+维基百科页面，测试12个先进模型在直接上下文和长文档检索两种场景的表现

Result: 专有模型（如GPT-4o）在直接上下文场景准确率70%，但长文档检索场景仅超50%；开源模型最高准确率仅27%

Conclusion: 长上下文多模态推理仍是重大挑战，WikiMixQA将成为推动文档理解研究的关键基准

Abstract: Documents are fundamental to preserving and disseminating information, often
incorporating complex layouts, tables, and charts that pose significant
challenges for automatic document understanding (DU). While vision-language
large models (VLLMs) have demonstrated improvements across various tasks, their
effectiveness in processing long-context vision inputs remains unclear. This
paper introduces WikiMixQA, a benchmark comprising 1,000 multiple-choice
questions (MCQs) designed to evaluate cross-modal reasoning over tables and
charts extracted from 4,000 Wikipedia pages spanning seven distinct topics.
Unlike existing benchmarks, WikiMixQA emphasizes complex reasoning by requiring
models to synthesize information from multiple modalities. We evaluate 12
state-of-the-art vision-language models, revealing that while proprietary
models achieve ~70% accuracy when provided with direct context, their
performance deteriorates significantly when retrieval from long documents is
required. Among these, GPT-4-o is the only model exceeding 50% accuracy in this
setting, whereas open-source models perform considerably worse, with a maximum
accuracy of 27%. These findings underscore the challenges of long-context,
multi-modal reasoning and establish WikiMixQA as a crucial benchmark for
advancing document understanding research.

Conclusion: 当前模型具备实用潜力但需改进语义表达机制，干扰项设计需融入教育学原理以提升有效性

Abstract: While MCQs are valuable for learning and evaluation, manually creating them
with varying difficulty levels and targeted reading skills remains a
time-consuming and costly task. Recent advances in generative AI provide an
opportunity to automate MCQ generation efficiently. However, assessing the
actual quality and reliability of generated MCQs has received limited attention
-- particularly regarding cases where generation fails. This aspect becomes
particularly important when the generated MCQs are meant to be applied in
real-world settings. Additionally, most MCQ generation studies focus on
English, leaving other languages underexplored. This paper investigates the
capabilities of current generative models in producing MCQs for reading
comprehension in Portuguese, a morphologically rich language. Our study focuses
on generating MCQs that align with curriculum-relevant narrative elements and
span different difficulty levels. We evaluate these MCQs through expert review
and by analyzing the psychometric properties extracted from student responses
to assess their suitability for elementary school students. Our results show
that current models can generate MCQs of comparable quality to human-authored
ones. However, we identify issues related to semantic clarity and
answerability. Also, challenges remain in generating distractors that engage
students and meet established criteria for high-quality MCQ option design.

Conclusion: 该框架为模型可解释性研究提供新范式，揭示了信息处理的耦合-解耦交替机制，通过神经元功能分组验证了认知模块化的神经网络实现路径

Abstract: Regret in Large Language Models refers to their explicit regret expression
when presented with evidence contradicting their previously generated
misinformation. Studying the regret mechanism is crucial for enhancing model
reliability and helps in revealing how cognition is coded in neural networks.
To understand this mechanism, we need to first identify regret expressions in
model outputs, then analyze their internal representation. This analysis
requires examining the model's hidden states, where information processing
occurs at the neuron level. However, this faces three key challenges: (1) the
absence of specialized datasets capturing regret expressions, (2) the lack of
metrics to find the optimal regret representation layer, and (3) the lack of
metrics for identifying and analyzing regret neurons. Addressing these
limitations, we propose: (1) a workflow for constructing a comprehensive regret
dataset through strategically designed prompting scenarios, (2) the Supervised
Compression-Decoupling Index (S-CDI) metric to identify optimal regret
representation layers, and (3) the Regret Dominance Score (RDS) metric to
identify regret neurons and the Group Impact Coefficient (GIC) to analyze
activation patterns. Our experimental results successfully identified the
optimal regret representation layer using the S-CDI metric, which significantly
enhanced performance in probe classification experiments. Additionally, we
discovered an M-shaped decoupling pattern across model layers, revealing how
information processing alternates between coupling and decoupling phases.
Through the RDS metric, we categorized neurons into three distinct functional
groups: regret neurons, non-regret neurons, and dual neurons.

*Yuka Machino,Matthias Hofer,Max Siegel,Joshua B. Tenenbaum,Robert D. Hawkins*

TL;DR: 通过计算认知模型揭示英式与美式英语使用者在强调词理解上的差异，发现文化差异源于字面意义与话语成本权重的双重作用


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究跨文化交际中强调词（如'quite''very'）的误解根源，区分语义差异与语用规范（礼貌/简洁）的贡献度

Method: 开展3个心理语言学实验，构建递归推理计算模型（综合信息量/礼貌度/话语成本三要素进行说话者意图推演）

Result: 文化差异成因：50%来自字面意义差异（如'quite'在英式英语中表弱化），50%源自话语成本权重差异（美式更重简洁）

Conclusion: 挑战单一因素解释理论，首次证实语义与语用要素的协同作用机制，为跨文化语用学研究提供新范式

Abstract: Misunderstandings in cross-cultural communication often arise from subtle
differences in interpretation, but it is unclear whether these differences
arise from the literal meanings assigned to words or from more general
pragmatic factors such as norms around politeness and brevity. In this paper,
we report three experiments examining how speakers of British and American
English interpret intensifiers like "quite" and "very." To better understand
these cross-cultural differences, we developed a computational cognitive model
where listeners recursively reason about speakers who balance informativity,
politeness, and utterance cost. Our model comparisons suggested that
cross-cultural differences in intensifier interpretation stem from a
combination of (1) different literal meanings, (2) different weights on
utterance cost. These findings challenge accounts based purely on semantic
variation or politeness norms, demonstrating that cross-cultural differences in
interpretation emerge from an intricate interplay between the two.

*Yusuke Sakai,Hidetaka Kamigaito,Taro Watanabe*

TL;DR: 提出了Ordered CommonGen基准来评估大语言模型在遵循指令顺序和组合泛化能力，发现现有模型存在顺序偏见且覆盖率不足


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成任务评估方法无法同时衡量指令遵循能力和组合泛化能力，当提示指定概念顺序时，需要新的评估体系来检测模型的真实表现

Method: 设计Ordered CommonGen基准，引入有序覆盖率指标，通过分析36个LLMs的输出，评估其是否符合指定顺序要求并保持输出多样性

Result: 最佳模型仅达到75%有序覆盖率，显示模型存在显著顺序偏见，改变概念顺序时输出多样性下降甚至重复

Conclusion: 当前LLMs需要同步提升指令遵循能力和组合泛化能力，该基准为这两种关键能力的联合评估提供了有效工具

Abstract: In generative commonsense reasoning tasks such as CommonGen, generative large
language models (LLMs) compose sentences that include all given concepts.
However, when focusing on instruction-following capabilities, if a prompt
specifies a concept order, LLMs must generate sentences that adhere to the
specified order. To address this, we propose Ordered CommonGen, a benchmark
designed to evaluate the compositional generalization and instruction-following
abilities of LLMs. This benchmark measures ordered coverage to assess whether
concepts are generated in the specified order, enabling a simultaneous
evaluation of both abilities. We conducted a comprehensive analysis using 36
LLMs and found that, while LLMs generally understand the intent of
instructions, biases toward specific concept order patterns often lead to
low-diversity outputs or identical results even when the concept order is
altered. Moreover, even the most instruction-compliant LLM achieved only about
75% ordered coverage, highlighting the need for improvements in both
instruction-following and compositional generalization capabilities.

evaluate six machine learning techniques: Support Vector Machine (SVM),
Logistic Regression (LR), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Decision Trees (DT),
Random Forests (RF), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), employing character
n-gram features for classification. Among these, the ANN model achieved the
highest performance, including perfect classification in four out of fifteen
runs when using 5-gram features. These results demonstrate that lightweight,
interpretable character n-gram approaches can deliver state-of-the-art accuracy
for Romanian authorship attribution, rivaling more complex methods. Our
findings highlight the potential of simple stylometric features in resource,

Result: 在ARC-Challenge等基准测试中超越预训练和SFT基线，准确率提升且推理稳定性增强

Conclusion: 队列层面的强化学习能有效提升语言模型的推理一致性

Abstract: Large language models excel at many tasks but still struggle with consistent,
robust reasoning. We introduce Cohort-based Consistency Learning (CC-Learn), a
reinforcement learning framework that improves the reliability of LLM reasoning
by training on cohorts of similar questions derived from shared programmatic
abstractions. To enforce cohort-level consistency, we define a composite
objective combining cohort accuracy, a retrieval bonus for effective problem
decomposition, and a rejection penalty for trivial or invalid lookups that
reinforcement learning can directly optimize, unlike supervised fine-tuning.
Optimizing this reward guides the model to adopt uniform reasoning patterns
across all cohort members. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks
(including ARC-Challenge and StrategyQA) show that CC-Learn boosts both
accuracy and reasoning stability over pretrained and SFT baselines. These
results demonstrate that cohort-level RL effectively enhances reasoning
consistency in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为推理轨迹是内部数据故安全，但实际研究发现其中常包含敏感信息，可能通过提示注入或意外输出造成隐私泄露

Method: 通过探测测试（probing）和代理评估（agentic evaluations），分析测试阶段计算资源增加（特别是推理步骤延长）对隐私泄露的影响

Result: 增加推理步骤会扩大隐私攻击面：模型在最终答案更谨慎的同时，会产生更详细的推理过程并泄露更多信息

Conclusion: 模型安全性需从输出安全扩展到内部思考过程的安全防护，揭示推理能力提升与隐私风险增加的核心矛盾

Abstract: We study privacy leakage in the reasoning traces of large reasoning models
used as personal agents. Unlike final outputs, reasoning traces are often
assumed to be internal and safe. We challenge this assumption by showing that
reasoning traces frequently contain sensitive user data, which can be extracted
via prompt injections or accidentally leak into outputs. Through probing and
agentic evaluations, we demonstrate that test-time compute approaches,
particularly increased reasoning steps, amplify such leakage. While increasing
the budget of those test-time compute approaches makes models more cautious in
their final answers, it also leads them to reason more verbosely and leak more
in their own thinking. This reveals a core tension: reasoning improves utility
but enlarges the privacy attack surface. We argue that safety efforts must
extend to the model's internal thinking, not just its outputs.

Method: 通过分析21个MT系统在三种翻译方向中的响应，分类性别中立策略，并考察二元性别刻板印象的影响。

Result: 绝大多数系统未实现性别中立翻译，仅少数系统根据目标语言特性采用特定中性化策略。

Conclusion: 当前机器翻译系统性别中立能力不足，但存在目标语言定制化解决方案的可能性，需针对性改进策略。

Abstract: Gender-inclusive machine translation (MT) should preserve gender ambiguity in
the source to avoid misgendering and representational harms. While gender
ambiguity often occurs naturally in notional gender languages such as English,
maintaining that gender neutrality in grammatical gender languages is a
challenge. Here we assess the sensitivity of 21 MT systems to the need for
gender neutrality in response to gender ambiguity in three translation
directions of varying difficulty. The specific gender-neutral strategies that
are observed in practice are categorized and discussed. Additionally, we
examine the effect of binary gender stereotypes on the use of gender-neutral
translation. In general, we report a disappointing absence of gender-neutral
translations in response to gender ambiguity. However, we observe a small
handful of MT systems that switch to gender neutral translation using specific
strategies, depending on the target language.

Result: 在多个基准测试中超越基线模型及大规模开源/闭源视觉语言模型

Conclusion: GenRecal突破了特定模型架构限制，为高效视觉语言模型部署提供新方案

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have leveraged large
language models (LLMs) to achieve performance on par with closed-source systems
like GPT-4V. However, deploying these models in real-world scenarios,
particularly on resource-constrained devices, remains challenging due to their
substantial computational demands. This has spurred interest in distilling
knowledge from large VLMs into smaller, more efficient counterparts. A key
challenge arises here from the diversity of VLM architectures, which are built
on different LLMs and employ varying token types-differing in vocabulary size,
token splits, and token index ordering. To address this challenge of limitation
to a specific VLM type, we present Generation after Recalibration (GenRecal), a
novel, general-purpose distillation framework for VLMs. GenRecal incorporates a
Recalibrator that aligns and adapts feature representations between
heterogeneous VLMs, enabling effective knowledge transfer across different
types of VLMs. Through extensive experiments on multiple challenging
benchmarks, we demonstrate that GenRecal significantly improves baseline
performances, eventually outperforming large-scale open- and closed-source
VLMs.

Result: 在LLaMA/Gemma/Mistral家族数据上达到96%+的F1值，超越7个基线模型和3个工业级服务

Conclusion: 首次系统性解决私有调优LLM检测难题，为防范AI滥用提供可靠技术方案

Abstract: With the popularity of large language models (LLMs), undesirable societal
problems like misinformation production and academic misconduct have been more
severe, making LLM-generated text detection now of unprecedented importance.
Although existing methods have made remarkable progress, a new challenge posed
by text from privately tuned LLMs remains underexplored. Users could easily
possess private LLMs by fine-tuning an open-source one with private corpora,
resulting in a significant performance drop of existing detectors in practice.
To address this issue, we propose PhantomHunter, an LLM-generated text detector
specialized for detecting text from unseen, privately-tuned LLMs. Its
family-aware learning framework captures family-level traits shared across the
base models and their derivatives, instead of memorizing individual
characteristics. Experiments on data from LLaMA, Gemma, and Mistral families
show its superiority over 7 baselines and 3 industrial services, with F1 scores
of over 96%.

Result: 在模拟和合成数据上的实验显示定量/定性评估均超越现有SOTA方法

Conclusion: 为可穿戴动作捕捉开辟新方向，证明服装参数整合对动态衣物场景的有效性

Abstract: Motion capture using sparse inertial sensors has shown great promise due to
its portability and lack of occlusion issues compared to camera-based tracking.
Existing approaches typically assume that IMU sensors are tightly attached to
the human body. However, this assumption often does not hold in real-world
scenarios. In this paper, we present a new task of full-body human pose
estimation using sparse, loosely attached IMU sensors. To solve this task, we
simulate IMU recordings from an existing garment-aware human motion dataset. We
developed transformer-based diffusion models to synthesize loose IMU data and
estimate human poses based on this challenging loose IMU data. In addition, we
show that incorporating garment-related parameters while training the model on
simulated loose data effectively maintains expressiveness and enhances the
ability to capture variations introduced by looser or tighter garments.
Experiments show that our proposed diffusion methods trained on simulated and
synthetic data outperformed the state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and
qualitatively, opening up a promising direction for future research.

Result: 实验证明该方法能一次性生成逼真且高度一致的素描，相比其他方法更便捷且适用性更广

Conclusion: 该方案解决了小样本场景下的素描合成难题，新构建的OS-Sketch数据集为相关研究提供了标准化评估基准

Abstract: Face sketch synthesis is a technique aimed at converting face photos into
sketches. Existing face sketch synthesis research mainly relies on training
with numerous photo-sketch sample pairs from existing datasets. However, these
large-scale discriminative learning methods will have to face problems such as
data scarcity and high human labor costs. Once the training data becomes
scarce, their generative performance significantly degrades. In this paper, we
propose a one-shot face sketch synthesis method based on diffusion models. We
optimize text instructions on a diffusion model using face photo-sketch image
pairs. Then, the instructions derived through gradient-based optimization are
used for inference. To simulate real-world scenarios more accurately and
evaluate method effectiveness more comprehensively, we introduce a new
benchmark named One-shot Face Sketch Dataset (OS-Sketch). The benchmark
consists of 400 pairs of face photo-sketch images, including sketches with
different styles and photos with different backgrounds, ages, sexes,
expressions, illumination, etc. For a solid out-of-distribution evaluation, we
select only one pair of images for training at each time, with the rest used
for inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can
convert various photos into realistic and highly consistent sketches in a
one-shot context. Compared to other methods, our approach offers greater
convenience and broader applicability. The dataset will be available at:

Conclusion: Nabla-R2D3为3D生成模型提供有效的强化学习对齐方案，显著提升生成内容的质量和可控性

Abstract: Generating high-quality and photorealistic 3D assets remains a longstanding
challenge in 3D vision and computer graphics. Although state-of-the-art
generative models, such as diffusion models, have made significant progress in
3D generation, they often fall short of human-designed content due to limited
ability to follow instructions, align with human preferences, or produce
realistic textures, geometries, and physical attributes. In this paper, we
introduce Nabla-R2D3, a highly effective and sample-efficient reinforcement
learning alignment framework for 3D-native diffusion models using 2D rewards.
Built upon the recently proposed Nabla-GFlowNet method, which matches the score
function to reward gradients in a principled manner for reward finetuning, our
Nabla-R2D3 enables effective adaptation of 3D diffusion models using only 2D
reward signals. Extensive experiments show that, unlike vanilla finetuning
baselines which either struggle to converge or suffer from reward hacking,
Nabla-R2D3 consistently achieves higher rewards and reduced prior forgetting
within a few finetuning steps.

Abstract: AI agents today are mostly siloed - they either retrieve and reason over vast
amount of digital information and knowledge obtained online; or interact with
the physical world through embodied perception, planning and action - but
rarely both. This separation limits their ability to solve tasks that require
integrated physical and digital intelligence, such as cooking from online
recipes, navigating with dynamic map data, or interpreting real-world landmarks
using web knowledge. We introduce Embodied Web Agents, a novel paradigm for AI
agents that fluidly bridge embodiment and web-scale reasoning. To
operationalize this concept, we first develop the Embodied Web Agents task
environments, a unified simulation platform that tightly integrates realistic
3D indoor and outdoor environments with functional web interfaces. Building
upon this platform, we construct and release the Embodied Web Agents Benchmark,
which encompasses a diverse suite of tasks including cooking, navigation,
shopping, tourism, and geolocation - all requiring coordinated reasoning across
physical and digital realms for systematic assessment of cross-domain
intelligence. Experimental results reveal significant performance gaps between
state-of-the-art AI systems and human capabilities, establishing both
challenges and opportunities at the intersection of embodied cognition and
web-scale knowledge access. All datasets, codes and websites are publicly

Abstract: Aiming at the problem of difficulty in accurately identifying graphical
implicit correlations in multimodal irony detection tasks, this paper proposes
a Semantic Irony Recognition Network (SemIRNet). The model contains three main
innovations: (1) The ConceptNet knowledge base is introduced for the first time
to acquire conceptual knowledge, which enhances the model's common-sense

the word level and sample level are designed to model graphic-textual
correlations at different granularities; and (3) A contrastive learning loss
function is introduced to optimize the spatial distribution of the sample
features, which improves the separability of positive and negative samples.
Experiments on a publicly available multimodal irony detection benchmark
dataset show that the accuracy and F1 value of this model are improved by 1.64%
and 2.88% to 88.87% and 86.33%, respectively, compared with the existing
optimal methods. Further ablation experiments verify the important role of

Abstract: Videos contain a wealth of information, and generating detailed and accurate
descriptions in natural language is a key aspect of video understanding. In
this paper, we present video-SALMONN 2, an advanced audio-visual large language
model (LLM) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) designed for enhanced video (with
paired audio) captioning through directed preference optimisation (DPO). We
propose new metrics to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of video
descriptions, which are optimised using DPO. To further improve training, we
propose a novel multi-round DPO (MrDPO) approach, which involves periodically
updating the DPO reference model, merging and re-initialising the LoRA module
as a proxy for parameter updates after each training round (1,000 steps), and
incorporating guidance from ground-truth video captions to stabilise the
process. Experimental results show that MrDPO significantly enhances
video-SALMONN 2's captioning accuracy, reducing the captioning error rates by
28\%. The final video-SALMONN 2 model, with just 7 billion parameters,
surpasses leading models such as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro in video captioning
tasks, while maintaining highly competitive performance to the state-of-the-art
on widely used video question-answering benchmarks among models of similar

Conclusion: 该方法有效补充现有LLM服务基础设施，为代理应用提供更经济高效的解决方案

Abstract: LLM-based agentic applications have shown increasingly remarkable
capabilities in complex workflows but incur substantial costs due to extensive
planning and reasoning requirements. Existing LLM caching techniques (like
context caching and semantic caching), primarily designed for serving chatbots,
are insufficient for agentic applications where outputs depend on external data
or environmental contexts. We propose agentic plan caching, a novel approach
that extracts, stores, adapts, and reuses structured plan templates from
planning stages of agentic applications across semantically similar tasks to
reduce the cost of serving. Unlike traditional semantic caching, our system
extracts plan templates from completed agent executions at test-time, employs
keyword extraction to match new requests against cached plans, and utilizes
lightweight models to adapt these templates to task-specific plans with
contexts. Evaluation across multiple real-world agentic applications shows that
our system can reduce costs by 46.62% on average while maintaining performance,
offering a more efficient solution for serving LLM-based agents that
complements existing LLM serving infrastructures.

TL;DR: 开发定量框架评估大语言模型模拟人类行为的效果，发现现有模型在争议问题上无法有效模拟特定人群意见


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在社会科学研究中广泛应用，需系统性评估其模拟人类行为的准确性

Method: 基于假设检验开发定量框架，通过多选问卷场景检测LLM模拟行为与真实人类行为的偏差

Result: 流行LLM在模拟不同种族/年龄/收入群体对争议问题的意见时存在显著偏差

Conclusion: 现有LLM与目标人群对齐不足，需建立新实践标准而非简单模拟人类受试者

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly appear in social science
research (e.g., economics and marketing), it becomes crucial to assess how well
these models replicate human behavior. In this work, using hypothesis testing,
we present a quantitative framework to assess the misalignment between
LLM-simulated and actual human behaviors in multiple-choice survey settings.
This framework allows us to determine in a principled way whether a specific
language model can effectively simulate human opinions, decision-making, and
general behaviors represented through multiple-choice options. We applied this
framework to a popular language model for simulating people's opinions in
various public surveys and found that this model is ill-suited for simulating
the tested sub-populations (e.g., across different races, ages, and incomes)
for contentious questions. This raises questions about the alignment of this
language model with the tested populations, highlighting the need for new
practices in using LLMs for social science studies beyond naive simulations of
human subjects.

TL;DR: 提出MicroRicci算法，实现实时网格平滑的线性时间复杂度更新，在速度、质量和感知指标上全面超越现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统Ricci流求解器全局更新成本高、启发式方法收敛慢且参数敏感的问题，开发自适应的局部求解器以适应实时图形应用需求

Method: 结合编码理论的贪婪综合征解码步骤(O(E)时间定位最大曲率误差)与两个微型神经网络模块(自适应选择顶点和步长)，总参数量仅1.2K

Result: 在110个SJTU-TMQA网格上实现：迭代次数减少60%(400 vs 950)，曲率分布更紧致(0.185 vs 0.19)，UV失真-MOS相关性达-0.93，单次迭代仅增加0.25ms，总体加速1.8倍

Conclusion: 通过线性复杂度、自动超参数调整和高保真几何处理的三重优势，为图形学、仿真等实时应用提供了高效的网格平滑解决方案

Abstract: Real-time mesh smoothing at scale remains a formidable challenge: classical
Ricci-flow solvers demand costly global updates, while greedy heuristics suffer
from slow convergence or brittle tuning. We present MicroRicci, the first truly
self-tuning, local Ricci-flow solver that borrows ideas from coding theory and
packs them into just 1K + 200 parameters. Its primary core is a greedy
syndrome-decoding step that pinpoints and corrects the largest curvature error
in O(E) time, augmented by two tiny neural modules that adaptively choose
vertices and step sizes on the fly. On a diverse set of 110 SJTU-TMQA meshes,
MicroRicci slashes iteration counts from 950+=140 to 400+=80 (2.4x speedup),
tightens curvature spread from 0.19 to 0.185, and achieves a remarkable
UV-distortion-to-MOS correlation of r = -0.93. It adds only 0.25 ms per
iteration (0.80 to 1.05 ms), yielding an end-to-end 1.8x runtime acceleration
over state-of-the-art methods. MicroRicci's combination of linear-time updates,
automatic hyperparameter adaptation, and high-quality geometric and perceptual
results makes it well suited for real-time, resource-limited applications in
graphics, simulation, and related fields.

Motivation: 解决开放场景下传统EEG解码方法受噪声干扰大、泛化能力差的问题，突破封闭词汇限制

Method: 通过多模态融合策略同步处理EEG信号与眼动特征，构建跨被试的通用解码模型

Result: 文本生成BLEU提升27%，情感分类F1达80.3%，跨数据源准确率保持稳定

Conclusion: 多模态融合策略为高性能开放词汇脑机接口系统开辟了新方向

Abstract: Decoding natural language from brain activity using non-invasive
electroencephalography (EEG) remains a significant challenge in neuroscience
and machine learning, particularly for open-vocabulary scenarios where
traditional methods struggle with noise and variability. Previous studies have
achieved high accuracy on small-closed vocabularies, but it still struggles on
open vocabularies. In this study, we propose ETS, a framework that integrates
EEG with synchronized eye-tracking data to address two critical tasks: (1)
open-vocabulary text generation and (2) sentiment classification of perceived
language. Our model achieves a superior performance on BLEU and Rouge score for
EEG-To-Text decoding and up to 10% F1 score on EEG-based ternary sentiment
classification, which significantly outperforms supervised baselines.
Furthermore, we show that our proposed model can handle data from various
subjects and sources, showing great potential for high performance open
vocabulary eeg-to-text system.

TL;DR: 提出线性时间专家组合方法(AoE)，通过直接插值MoE模型权重生成高效子模型，无需微调即可继承父母模型能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降低大语言模型预训练中计算成本过高的问题（需10^13-10^15 FLOPs/权重），充分利用现有预训练模型资源。

Method: 线性插值混合专家模型的权重张量，通过调整父母模型权重比例选择性增强/抑制语义特征。

Result: 构建的DeepSeek R1T Chimera模型在保持R1级智能的同时，输出token减少40%，推理更紧凑有序。

Conclusion: AoE方法实现了零样本模型优化，证明通过简单权重组合即可涌现新能力，为模型迭代提供高效路径。

Abstract: Requiring $10^{13}$-$10^{15}$ FLOPs to calculate one 8 bit weight in an LLM
during pretraining is extremely expensive and seems inefficient. To better
leverage the huge investments made into pretrained models, we develop the new
"Assembly-of-Experts" (AoE) construction method to create capable child
variants of existing Mixture-of-Experts parent models in linear time. Model
weight tensors get interpolated individually, allowing to enhance or suppress
semantic features of the parents.
  Varying the proportion of weights taken from the parent models, we observe
some properties of the AoE child model changing gradually, while other
behavioral traits emerge with a sharp transition. Surprisingly, nearly every
generated model is functional and capable, which makes searching the model
space straightforward.
  We construct the DeepSeek R1T "Chimera", a 671B open-weights hybrid model
combining DeepSeek's V3-0324 and R1 model variants. The child inherits only the
routed expert tensors of R1, but still achieves about R1-level intelligence. At
the same time, it uses about 40\% fewer output tokens, close to V3 speed.
Constructed without any fine-tuning or distillation, the Chimera exhibits
surprisingly compact, orderly reasoning compared to its parent models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach to improve
large language model (LLM) reasoning, yet most open efforts focus narrowly on
math and code, limiting our understanding of its broader applicability to
general reasoning. A key challenge lies in the lack of reliable, scalable RL
reward signals across diverse reasoning domains. We introduce Guru, a curated
RL reasoning corpus of 92K verifiable examples spanning six reasoning
domains--Math, Code, Science, Logic, Simulation, and Tabular--each built
through domain-specific reward design, deduplication, and filtering to ensure
reliability and effectiveness for RL training. Based on Guru, we systematically
revisit established findings in RL for LLM reasoning and observe significant
variation across domains. For example, while prior work suggests that RL
primarily elicits existing knowledge from pretrained models, our results reveal
a more nuanced pattern: domains frequently seen during pretraining (Math, Code,
Science) easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while domains with
limited pretraining exposure (Logic, Simulation, and Tabular) require in-domain
training to achieve meaningful performance gains, suggesting that RL is likely
to facilitate genuine skill acquisition. Finally, we present Guru-7B and
Guru-32B, two models that achieve state-of-the-art performance among open
models RL-trained with publicly available data, outperforming best baselines by
7.9% and 6.7% on our 17-task evaluation suite across six reasoning domains. We
also show that our models effectively improve the Pass@k performance of their
base models, particularly on complex tasks less likely to appear in pretraining
data. We release data, models, training and evaluation code to facilitate
general-purpose reasoning at: https://github.com/LLM360/Reasoning360

TL;DR: 论文分析了词汇量对LLM训练动态的影响，揭示了μP理论在词汇量较大时的局限性，提出了嵌入层学习率与隐藏层学习率应遵循√(width)比例的新缩放规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统μP理论假设输入维度（词汇量）固定，但实际LLM中词汇量远大于模型宽度。本文旨在研究词汇量对训练动态的影响及其与模型宽度的相互作用。

Method: 通过理论分析训练动态与词汇量的关系，提出词汇量增加时训练动态在μP和大词汇(LV)两种机制间插值的观点。推导LV机制下的最优学习率缩放规则。

Result: 实验验证了LV机制下嵌入层学习率与隐藏层学习率的最优比例为√(width)，与文献实证结果一致。使用该规则预训练的1B模型显示性能提升。

Conclusion: 词汇量是影响参数缩放规则的关键因素，建议采用基于√(width)的嵌入层学习率缩放策略，可提升大模型训练效率。

Abstract: Pretraining large language models is a costly process. To make this process
more efficient, several methods have been proposed to optimize model
architecture/parametrization and hardware use. On the parametrization side,
$\mu P$ (Maximal Update Parametrization) parametrizes model weights and
learning rate (LR) in a way that makes hyperparameters (HPs) transferable with
width (embedding dimension): HPs can be tuned for a small model and used for
larger models without additional tuning. While $\mu$P showed impressive results
in practice, recent empirical studies have reported conflicting observations
when applied to LLMs. One limitation of the theory behind $\mu$P is the fact
that input dimension (vocabulary size in LLMs) is considered fixed when taking
the width to infinity. This is unrealistic since vocabulary size is generally
much larger than width in practice. In this work, we provide a theoretical
analysis of the effect of vocabulary size on training dynamics, and
subsequently show that as vocabulary size increases, the training dynamics
\emph{interpolate between the $\mu$P regime and another regime that we call
Large Vocab (LV) Regime}, where optimal scaling rules are different from those
predicted by $\mu$P. Our analysis reveals that in the LV regime, the optimal
embedding LR to hidden LR ratio should roughly scale as $\Theta(\sqrt{width})$,
surprisingly close to the empirical findings previously reported in the
literature, and different from the $\Theta(width)$ ratio predicted by $\mu$P.
We conduct several experiments to validate our theory, and pretrain a 1B model
from scratch to show the benefit of our suggested scaling rule for the
embedding LR.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent research shows that in-context learning (ICL) can be effective even
when demonstrations have missing or incorrect labels. To shed light on this
capability, we examine a canonical setting where the demonstrations are drawn
according to a binary Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and a certain fraction of
the demonstrations have missing labels. We provide a comprehensive theoretical
study to show that: (1) The loss landscape of one-layer linear attention models
recover the optimal fully-supervised estimator but completely fail to exploit
unlabeled data; (2) In contrast, multilayer or looped transformers can
effectively leverage unlabeled data by implicitly constructing estimators of
the form $\sum_{i\ge 0} a_i (X^\top X)^iX^\top y$ with $X$ and $y$ denoting
features and partially-observed labels (with missing entries set to zero). We
characterize the class of polynomials that can be expressed as a function of
depth and draw connections to Expectation Maximization, an iterative
pseudo-labeling algorithm commonly used in semi-supervised learning.
Importantly, the leading polynomial power is exponential in depth, so mild
amount of depth/looping suffices. As an application of theory, we propose
looping off-the-shelf tabular foundation models to enhance their
semi-supervision capabilities. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets
show that our method significantly improves the semisupervised tabular learning
performance over the standard single pass inference.

Motivation: 现有特征描述方法存在鲁棒性不足和单语义性假设缺陷，无法有效解释神经元多语义性现象

Method: 开发PRISM框架(多语义特征识别与评分方法)，通过多概念描述替代单概念描述，应用于语言模型并与传统方法进行基准测试

Result: 在描述质量(description score)和多语义捕获能力(polysemanticity score)上均优于现有方法

Conclusion: PRISM突破单语义假设限制，通过多维度特征描述显著提升模型内部行为的解释能力

Abstract: Automated interpretability research aims to identify concepts encoded in
neural network features to enhance human understanding of model behavior.
Current feature description methods face two critical challenges: limited
robustness and the flawed assumption that each neuron encodes only a single
concept (monosemanticity), despite growing evidence that neurons are often
polysemantic. This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature
descriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors
encoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe
Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework that captures the
inherent complexity of neural network features. Unlike prior approaches that
assign a single description per feature, PRISM provides more nuanced
descriptions for both polysemantic and monosemantic features. We apply PRISM to
language models and, through extensive benchmarking against existing methods,
demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature
descriptions, improving both overall description quality (via a description
score) and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is
present (via a polysemanticity score).

Conclusion: LoX通过低秩子空间外推，在无需训练的情况下有效提升模型安全性鲁棒性，平衡安全防御与任务适应性。代码已开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable in real-world
applications. However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety
concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite
substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models
can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning -
even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we
empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of
safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building
on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank
Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety
subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness
of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both
benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's
adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute
reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning
attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the
success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter
zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations. The code is available at
github.com/VITA-Group/LoX.

Abstract: Rule-based rewards offer a promising strategy for improving reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF), but current approaches often rely on
manual rule engineering. We present AutoRule, a fully automated method for
extracting rules from preference feedback and formulating them into rule-based
rewards. AutoRule extraction operates in three stages: it leverages a reasoning
model to interpret user preferences, identifies candidate rules from the
reasoning chain of these interpretations, and synthesizes them into a unified
rule set. Leveraging the finalized rule set, we employ language-model verifiers
to compute the fraction of rules satisfied by each output, using this metric as
an auxiliary reward alongside the learned reward model during policy
optimization. Training a Llama-3-8B model with AutoRule results in a 28.6\%
relative improvement in length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2.0, and a
6.1\% relative gain in second-turn performance on a held-out MT-Bench subset,
compared to a GRPO baseline trained with the same learned reward model but
without the rule-based auxiliary reward. Our analysis confirms that the
extracted rules exhibit good agreement with dataset preference. We find that
AutoRule demonstrates reduced reward hacking compared to a learned reward model
when run over two episodes. Finally, our case study suggests that the extracted
rules capture unique qualities valued in different datasets. The extracted
rules are provided in the appendix, and the code is open-sourced at

Result: 发现密集潜在变量具有位置跟踪/上下文绑定/熵调节等功能，并在不同层呈现结构特征→语义特征→输出导向信号的演化模式

Conclusion: 密集潜在变量在语言模型计算中承担重要功能角色，不应被简单视为训练噪声

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are designed to extract interpretable features
from language models by enforcing a sparsity constraint. Ideally, training an
SAE would yield latents that are both sparse and semantically meaningful.
However, many SAE latents activate frequently (i.e., are \emph{dense}), raising
concerns that they may be undesirable artifacts of the training procedure. In
this work, we systematically investigate the geometry, function, and origin of
dense latents and show that they are not only persistent but often reflect
meaningful model representations. We first demonstrate that dense latents tend
to form antipodal pairs that reconstruct specific directions in the residual
stream, and that ablating their subspace suppresses the emergence of new dense
features in retrained SAEs -- suggesting that high density features are an
intrinsic property of the residual space. We then introduce a taxonomy of dense
latents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding,
entropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and
principal component reconstruction. Finally, we analyze how these features
evolve across layers, revealing a shift from structural features in early
layers, to semantic features in mid layers, and finally to output-oriented
signals in the last layers of the model. Our findings indicate that dense
latents serve functional roles in language model computation and should not be
dismissed as training noise.

Conclusion: HAC成功统一声学细节与词汇意义，为语音生成与理解任务提供有效的分层离散表示，证明多级语言学建模在语音表征学习中的优势

Abstract: We propose Hierarchical Audio Codec (HAC), a unified neural speech codec that
factorizes its bottleneck into three linguistic levels-acoustic, phonetic, and
lexical-within a single model. HAC leverages two knowledge distillation
objectives: one from a pre-trained speech encoder (HuBERT) for phoneme-level
structure, and another from a text-based encoder (LaBSE) for lexical cues.
Experiments on English and multilingual data show that HAC's factorized
bottleneck yields disentangled token sets: one aligns with phonemes, while
another captures word-level semantics. Quantitative evaluations confirm that
HAC tokens preserve naturalness and provide interpretable linguistic
information, outperforming single-level baselines in both disentanglement and
reconstruction quality. These findings underscore HAC's potential as a unified
discrete speech representation, bridging acoustic detail and lexical meaning
for downstream speech generation and understanding tasks.

Abstract: Detailed captions that accurately reflect the characteristics of a music
piece can enrich music databases and drive forward research in music AI. This
paper introduces a multi-task music captioning model, SonicVerse, that
integrates caption generation with auxiliary music feature detection tasks such
as key detection, vocals detection, and more, so as to directly capture both
low-level acoustic details as well as high-level musical attributes. The key
contribution is a projection-based architecture that transforms audio input
into language tokens, while simultaneously detecting music features through
dedicated auxiliary heads. The outputs of these heads are also projected into
language tokens, to enhance the captioning input. This framework not only
produces rich, descriptive captions for short music fragments but also directly
enables the generation of detailed time-informed descriptions for longer music
pieces, by chaining the outputs using a large-language model. To train the
model, we extended the MusicBench dataset by annotating it with music features
using MIRFLEX, a modular music feature extractor, resulting in paired audio,
captions and music feature data. Experimental results show that incorporating
features in this way improves the quality and detail of the generated captions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发无需先验知识的无监督数学方法，实时检测全球危机事件中公众话语体系的结构性突变。

Method: 构建新闻名词共现网络→计算持续同调(Vietoris-Rips过滤)→分析H0/H1维度的Wasserstein距离和持续熵→交叉相关性分析时序模式

Result: 地缘事件引发H0(连接组件)/H1(环路)熵值突变；除乌克兰战争外，H0变化普遍领先H1(体现自下而上语义重组)；持续熵可区分叙事聚焦程度

Conclusion: 拓扑方法为计算社会科学提供了实时检测语义结构剧变的数学框架，特别适用于信息冲击下的叙事演化追踪与转折点识别。

Abstract: How can we detect when global events fundamentally reshape public discourse?
This study introduces a topological framework for identifying structural change
in media narratives using persistent homology. Drawing on international news
articles surrounding major events - including the Russian invasion of Ukraine
(Feb 2022), the murder of George Floyd (May 2020), the U.S. Capitol
insurrection (Jan 2021), and the Hamas-led invasion of Israel (Oct 2023) - we
construct daily co-occurrence graphs of noun phrases to trace evolving
discourse. Each graph is embedded and transformed into a persistence diagram
via a Vietoris-Rips filtration. We then compute Wasserstein distances and
persistence entropies across homological dimensions to capture semantic
disruption and narrative volatility over time. Our results show that major
geopolitical and social events align with sharp spikes in both H0 (connected
components) and H1 (loops), indicating sudden reorganization in narrative
structure and coherence. Cross-correlation analyses reveal a typical lag
pattern in which changes to component-level structure (H0) precede higher-order
motif shifts (H1), suggesting a bottom-up cascade of semantic change. An
exception occurs during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, where H1 entropy leads
H0, possibly reflecting top-down narrative framing before local discourse
adjusts. Persistence entropy further distinguishes tightly focused from diffuse
narrative regimes. These findings demonstrate that persistent homology offers a
mathematically principled, unsupervised method for detecting inflection points
and directional shifts in public attention - without requiring prior knowledge
of specific events. This topological approach advances computational social
science by enabling real-time detection of semantic restructuring during
crises, protests, and information shocks.

TL;DR: 研究评估了GPT-4o在提取经济叙事任务中的表现，发现其能够生成结构化结果但仍未达到专家水平


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NLP模型（如BERT）在语义理解层面存在局限，无法有效区分经济叙事提取与基础语义标注任务。LLM的出现为经济研究提供了新的技术可能性

Method: 使用华尔街日报和纽约时报的通胀报道，对比GPT-4o输出与专家标注的黄金标准叙事框架

Result: GPT-4o能够提取结构化经济叙事，但在处理复杂文档时表现仍逊于专家标注

Conclusion: 建议未来研究结合LLM优势与领域专业知识，开发适合经济社会科学的定制化叙事提取方案

Abstract: As interest in economic narratives has grown in recent years, so has the
number of pipelines dedicated to extracting such narratives from texts.
Pipelines often employ a mix of state-of-the-art natural language processing
techniques, such as BERT, to tackle this task. While effective on foundational
linguistic operations essential for narrative extraction, such models lack the
deeper semantic understanding required to distinguish extracting economic
narratives from merely conducting classic tasks like Semantic Role Labeling.
Instead of relying on complex model pipelines, we evaluate the benefits of
Large Language Models (LLMs) by analyzing a corpus of Wall Street Journal and
New York Times newspaper articles about inflation. We apply a rigorous
narrative definition and compare GPT-4o outputs to gold-standard narratives
produced by expert annotators. Our results suggests that GPT-4o is capable of
extracting valid economic narratives in a structured format, but still falls
short of expert-level performance when handling complex documents and
narratives. Given the novelty of LLMs in economic research, we also provide
guidance for future work in economics and the social sciences that employs LLMs
to pursue similar objectives.
