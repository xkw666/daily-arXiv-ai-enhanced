The datasets\ngrounded in the Chinese language and culture are scarce. More importantly,\nthese datasets usually only support single evaluation tasks and cannot evaluate\nthe bias from multiple aspects in LLMs. To address these issues, we present a\nMulti-task Chinese Bias Evaluation Benchmark (McBE) that includes 4,077 bias\nevaluation instances, covering 12 single bias categories, 82 subcategories and\nintroducing 5 evaluation tasks, providing extensive category coverage, content\ndiversity, and measuring comprehensiveness.

Our evaluation\naddresses three key questions: (i) how the introduction of reasoning\ncapabilities affects model fairness and robustness; (ii) whether models\nfine-tuned for reasoning exhibit greater safety than those relying on CoT\nprompting at inference time; and (iii) how the success rate of jailbreak\nattacks targeting bias elicitation varies with the reasoning mechanisms\nemployed.

Recently, large\nlanguage models (LLMs) have exhibited state-of-the-art performance in multiple\nnatural language processing tasks, including text summarization and entailment.\nTo support interviewers, we investigate the application of GPT-4o to generate\nfollow-up interview questions during requirements elicitation by building on a\nframework of common interviewer mistake types. In addition, we describe methods\nto generate questions based on interviewee speech. We report a controlled\nexperiment to evaluate LLM-generated and human-authored questions with minimal\nguidance, and a second controlled experiment to evaluate the LLM-generated\nquestions when generation is guided by interviewer mistake types. Our findings\ndemonstrate that, for both experiments, the LLM-generated questions are no\nworse than the human-authored questions with respect to clarity, relevancy, and\ninformativeness. In addition, LLM-generated questions outperform human-authored\nquestions when guided by common mistakes types. This highlights the potential\nof using LLMs to help interviewers improve the quality and ease of requirements\nelicitation interviews in real time."}
