While\nseveral recent works have extended 3DGS to mitigate these approximation errors,\nnone have successfully achieved both exactness and high efficiency\nsimultaneously. In this work, we introduce 3DGEER, an Exact and Efficient\nVolumetric Gaussian Rendering method.

We argue that such systems have\npreviously been unable to represent human meaning because they rely on thin\ndescriptions: numerical representations that enforce standardization and\ntherefore strip human activity of the cultural context that gives it meaning.\nBy contrast, scholars in the humanities and qualitative social sciences have\ndeveloped frameworks for representing meaning through thick description: verbal\nrepresentations that accommodate heterogeneity and retain contextual\ninformation needed to represent human meaning. While these methods can\neffectively codify meaning, they are difficult to deploy at scale. However, the\nverbal capabilities of LLMs now provide a means of (at least partially)\nautomating the generation and processing of thick descriptions, potentially\novercoming this bottleneck. We argue that the problem of rendering human\nmeaning legible is not just about selecting better metrics, but about\ndeveloping new representational formats (based on thick description). We frame\nthis as a crucial direction for the application of generative AI and identify\nfive key challenges: preserving context, maintaining interpretive pluralism,\nintegrating perspectives based on lived experience and critical distance,\ndistinguishing qualitative content from quantitative magnitude, and\nacknowledging meaning as dynamic rather than static.

To achieve this, we first develop a mathematic framework that\ndefines abstract reasoning as the ability to: (i) extract essential patterns\nindependent of surface representations, and (ii) apply consistent rules to\nthese abstract patterns. Based on this framework, we introduce two novel\ncomplementary metrics: \\(\\scoreGamma\\) measures basic reasoning accuracy, while\n\\(\\scoreDelta\\) quantifies a model's reliance on specific symbols rather than\nunderlying patterns - a key indicator of true abstraction versus mere\nmemorization. To implement this measurement, we design a benchmark: systematic\nsymbol remapping in rule-based tasks, which forces models to demonstrate\ngenuine pattern recognition beyond superficial token matching. Extensive LLM\nevaluations using this benchmark (commercial API models, 7B-70B, multi-agent)\nreveal:1) critical limitations in non-decimal arithmetic and symbolic\nreasoning; 2) persistent abstraction gaps despite chain-of-thought prompting;\nand 3) \\(\\scoreDelta\\)'s effectiveness in robustly measuring memory dependence\nby quantifying performance degradation under symbol remapping, particularly\nhighlighting operand-specific memorization.

Prior\nwork has explored confidence estimation as an effective approach to\nhallucination detection, but often relies on post-hoc self-consistency methods\nthat require computationally expensive sampling. Verbalized confidence offers a\nmore efficient alternative, but existing approaches are largely limited to\nshort-form question answering (QA) tasks and do not generalize well to\nopen-ended generation. In this paper, we propose LoVeC (Long-form Verbalized\nConfidence), an on-the-fly verbalized confidence estimation method for\nlong-form generation. Specifically, we use reinforcement learning (RL) to train\nLLMs to append numerical confidence scores to each generated statement, serving\nas a direct and interpretable signal of the factuality of generation. Our\nexperiments consider both on-policy and off-policy RL methods, including DPO,\nORPO, and GRPO, to enhance the model calibration. We introduce two novel\nevaluation settings, free-form tagging and iterative tagging, to assess\ndifferent verbalized confidence estimation methods.

To bridge this gap, we focus on layers and their size, which\nmainly decide the parameter size of Transformers. For this purpose, we first\ntheoretically investigate the layers within the residual stream through a\nbias-diversity decomposition. The decomposition separates (i) bias, the error\nof each layer's output from the ground truth, and (ii) diversity, which\nindicates how much the outputs of each layer differ from each other.

Moreover, LLMs are still limited in their capacity for rigorous and\nrobust proof construction within formal verification frameworks. To mitigate\nissues related to faithfulness and robustness, this paper investigates\nstrategies to (1) alleviate semantic loss during autoformalisation, (2)\nefficiently identify and correct syntactic errors in logical representations,\n(3) explicitly use logical expressions to guide LLMs in generating structured\nproof sketches, and (4) increase LLMs' capacity of interpreting TP's feedback\nfor iterative refinement.

In this paper, we propose to harness\nlarge language models (LLMs) for scientific novelty detection (ND), associated\nwith two new datasets in marketing and NLP domains. To construct the\nconsiderate datasets for ND, we propose to extract closure sets of papers based\non their relationship, and then summarize their main ideas based on LLMs. To\ncapture idea conception, we propose to train a lightweight retriever by\ndistilling the idea-level knowledge from LLMs to align ideas with similar\nconception, enabling efficient and accurate idea retrieval for LLM novelty\ndetection. Experiments show our method consistently outperforms others on the\nproposed benchmark datasets for idea retrieval and ND tasks.

This fast\nweight, akin to recurrent states in RNNs, stores temporary memories of past\ntokens in the current sequence. Existing TTT methods struggled to show\neffectiveness in handling long-context data, due to their inefficiency on\nmodern GPUs. The TTT layers in many of these approaches operate with extremely\nlow FLOPs utilization (often <5%) because they deliberately apply small online\nminibatch sizes (e.g., updating fast weights every 16 or 64 tokens). Moreover,\na small minibatch implies fine-grained block-wise causal dependencies in the\ndata, unsuitable for data beyond 1D ordered sequences, like sets or\nN-dimensional grids such as images or videos. In contrast, we pursue the\nopposite direction by using an extremely large chunk update, ranging from 2K to\n1M tokens across tasks of varying modalities, which we refer to as Large Chunk\nTest-Time Training (LaCT). It improves hardware utilization by orders of\nmagnitude, and more importantly, facilitates scaling of nonlinear state size\n(up to 40% of model parameters), hence substantially improving state capacity,\nall without requiring cumbersome and error-prone kernel implementations. It\nalso allows easy integration of sophisticated optimizers, e.g. Muon for online\nupdates.

To\naddress this, we introduce Agent-X, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating\nvision-centric agents multi-step and deep reasoning capabilities in real-world,\nmultimodal settings. Agent- X features 828 agentic tasks with authentic visual\ncontexts, including images, multi-image comparisons, videos, and instructional\ntext. These tasks span six major agentic environments: general visual\nreasoning, web browsing, security and surveillance, autonomous driving, sports,\nand math reasoning. Our benchmark requires agents to integrate tool use with\nexplicit, stepwise decision-making in these diverse settings. In addition, we\npropose a fine-grained, step-level evaluation framework that assesses the\ncorrectness and logical coherence of each reasoning step and the effectiveness\nof tool usage throughout the task. Our results reveal that even the\nbest-performing models, including GPT, Gemini, and Qwen families, struggle to\nsolve multi-step vision tasks, achieving less than 50% full-chain success.\nThese findings highlight key bottlenecks in current LMM reasoning and tool-use\ncapabilities and identify future research directions in vision-centric agentic\nreasoning models.

While modern multimodal LLM agents have demonstrated\nimpressive performance in static perception tasks, their ability to handle\ninteractive, multi-step reasoning challenges like CAPTCHAs is largely untested.\nTo address this gap, we introduce Open CaptchaWorld, the first web-based\nbenchmark and platform specifically designed to evaluate the visual reasoning\nand interaction capabilities of MLLM-powered agents through diverse and dynamic\nCAPTCHA puzzles. Our benchmark spans 20 modern CAPTCHA types, totaling 225\nCAPTCHAs, annotated with a new metric we propose: CAPTCHA Reasoning Depth,\nwhich quantifies the number of cognitive and motor steps required to solve each\npuzzle. Experimental results show that humans consistently achieve near-perfect\nscores, state-of-the-art MLLM agents struggle significantly, with success rates\nat most 40.0% by Browser-Use Openai-o3, far below human-level performance,\n93.3%. This highlights Open CaptchaWorld as a vital benchmark for diagnosing\nthe limits of current multimodal agents and guiding the development of more\nrobust multimodal reasoning systems.
