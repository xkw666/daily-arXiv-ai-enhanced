These visuals are important because they convey hazard information quickly, reduce reliance on lengthy text, and support decision-making in time-critical situations. However, despite their importance, disaster information graphics do not work equally well for all audiences. In practice, many graphics remain difficult to interpret, and their accessibility for vulnerable populations is still uneven and underexplored. Despite their central role, there has been little empirical work examining how graphics shape disaster communication, what challenges practitioners face in using them, and, most importantly, how inclusive current disaster graphics are in real-world settings. To address this gap, we examine how information graphics are currently produced and used in disaster communication, what issues emerge in practice, and how inclusivity is addressed. We conducted semi-structured interviews with disaster communication practitioners and researchers to examine the role of graphics across preparedness, warning, and response contexts, as well as the barriers experienced by vulnerable communities. Our findings show that graphics are widely expected and heavily relied upon, yet significant accessibility gaps persist for groups such as people with vision impairments, older adults, and culturally and linguistically diverse communities. Participants also highlighted that inclusive adaptations are difficult to achieve during unfolding emergencies due to operational constraints, limited guidance, and resource barriers. Based on these findings, we outline recommendations for disaster management agencies and graphic designers and identify research directions for technological and adaptive support to make disaster graphics more inclusive at scale."}

This result-oriented approach fails to distinguish whether model errors stem from insufficient domain knowledge or deficiencies in cognitive capacity, thereby limiting the diagnostic value. To address this, we propose STEMVerse, a diagnostic framework designed to systematically analyze the STEM reasoning capabilities of LLMs. This framework characterizes model performance across academic specialization and cognitive complexity to map the capability required for reasoning. We re-aggregate over 20,000 STEM problems from mainstream benchmarks into a unified \"Discipline $\\times$ Cognition\" capability space, assigning dual-axis labels to every instance. Utilizing this unified diagnostic framework, we systematically evaluate representative LLM families across varying parameter scales and training paradigms. Our empirical results reveal structural failure patterns in STEM reasoning. By integrating multi-disciplinary coverage and fine-grained cognitive stratification into a unified framework, STEMVerse provides a clear and actionable perspective for understanding the scientific reasoning characteristics of LLMs."}

Detoxification is therefore important for safety and user trust, particularly when we want to reduce harmful content without sacrificing the model's generation quality. Many existing approaches rely on model retraining, gradients, or learned auxiliary components, which can be costly and may not transfer across model families or to truly black-box settings. We introduce a test-time procedure that approximates the gradient of completion toxicity with respect to the input embeddings and uses a small number of descent steps to steer generation toward less toxic continuations. This is achieved with zeroth-order optimization that requires only access to input embeddings, a toxicity scoring function, and forward evaluations of the model. Empirically, the approach delivers robust toxicity reductions across models and prompts and, in most settings, achieves the best overall toxicity-quality trade-off. More broadly, our work positions word embeddings as effective control variables and encourages wider use of black-box optimization to guide autoregressive language models toward scalable, safer text generation, without requiring any training or access to intermediate computations."}

However, in dense and geographically constrained 3D urban environments, visual representations of time-varying building data often suffer from occlusion and visual clutter. To address these two challenges, we introduce an immersive lens visualization that integrates a view-dependent cutaway de-occlusion technique and a temporal display derived from a conformal mapping algorithm. The mapping process first partitions irregular building footprints into smaller, sufficiently regular subregions that serve as structural primitives. These subregions are then seamlessly recombined to form a conformal, layered layout for our temporal lens visualization. The view-responsive cutaway is inspired by traditional architectural illustrations, preserving the overall layout of the building and its surroundings to maintain users' sense of spatial orientation. This lens design enables the occlusion-free embedding of shape-adaptive temporal displays across building facades on demand, supporting rapid time-space association for the discovery, access and interpretation of spatiotemporal urban patterns. Guided by domain and design goals, we outline the rationale behind the lens visual and interaction design choices, such as the encoding of time progression and temporal values in the conforming lens image. A user study compares our approach against conventional juxtaposition and x-ray spatiotemporal designs. Results validate the usage and utility of our lens, showing that it improves task accuracy and completion time, reduces navigation effort, and increases user confidence. From these findings, we distill design recommendations and promising directions for future research on spatially-embedded lenses in 3D visualization and urban analytics."}

Existing efficient attention methods reduce computational complexity, but they typically suffer from a limited coverage of the model state. This paper proposes ROSA-Tuning, a retrieval-and-recall mechanism for enhancing the long-context modeling ability of pretrained models. Beyond the standard attention mechanism, ROSA-Tuning introduces in parallel a CPU-based ROSA (RWKV Online Suffix Automaton) retrieval module, which efficiently locates historical positions in long contexts that are relevant to the current query, and injects the retrieved information into the model state in a trainable manner; subsequent weighted fusion can then be handled by range-restricted attention. To enable end-to-end training, we design a binary discretization strategy and a counterfactual gradient algorithm, and further optimize overall execution efficiency via an asynchronous CPU-GPU pipeline. Systematic evaluations on Qwen3-Base-1.7B show that ROSA-Tuning substantially restores the long-context modeling ability of windowed-attention models, achieving performance close to and in some cases matching global attention on benchmarks such as LongBench, while maintaining computational efficiency and GPU memory usage that are nearly comparable to windowed-attention methods, offering a new technical path for efficient long-context processing.

To address the scarcity of training data, we introduce a scalable engine that bootstraps high-quality supervision from commercial Live2D models, capturing pixel-perfect semantics and hidden geometry. Our methodology couples a diffusion-based Body Part Consistency Module, which enforces global geometric coherence, with a pixel-level pseudo-depth inference mechanism. This combination resolves the intricate stratification of anime characters, e.g., interleaving hair strands, allowing for dynamic layer reconstruction. We demonstrate that our approach yields high-fidelity, manipulatable models suitable for professional, real-time animation applications."}

However, existing models lack a mechanism for smoothly controlling the intensity of text-guided edits. In standard text-conditioned generation, Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) impacts prompt adherence, suggesting it as a potential control for edit intensity in editing models. However, we show that scaling CFG in these models does not produce a smooth transition between the input and the edited result. We attribute this behavior to the unconditional prediction, which serves as the guidance origin and dominates the generation at low guidance scales, while representing an arbitrary manipulation of the input content. To enable continuous control, we introduce Adaptive-Origin Guidance (AdaOr), a method that adjusts this standard guidance origin with an identity-conditioned adaptive origin, using an identity instruction corresponding to the identity manipulation. By interpolating this identity prediction with the standard unconditional prediction according to the edit strength, we ensure a continuous transition from the input to the edited result. We evaluate our method on image and video editing tasks, demonstrating that it provides smoother and more consistent control compared to current slider-based editing approaches. Our method incorporates an identity instruction into the standard training framework, enabling fine-grained control at inference time without per-edit procedure or reliance on specialized datasets."}

This fragility reflects a broader challenge of modern neural language models: small, carefully structured perturbations in high-dimensional input spaces can induce large and unpredictable changes in internal semantic representations and output.\n  We investigate monotonicity as an architectural inductive bias for improving the robustness of Transformer-based language models. Monotonicity constrains semantic transformations so that strengthening information, evidence, or constraints cannot lead to regressions in the corresponding internal representations. Such order-preserving behavior has long been exploited in control and safety-critical systems to simplify reasoning and improve robustness, but has traditionally been viewed as incompatible with the expressivity required by neural language models.\n  We show that this trade-off is not inherent. By enforcing monotonicity selectively in the feed-forward sublayers of sequence-to-sequence Transformers -- while leaving attention mechanisms unconstrained -- we obtain monotone language models that preserve the performance of their pretrained counterparts. This architectural separation allows negation, contradiction, and contextual interactions to be introduced explicitly through attention, while ensuring that subsequent semantic refinement is order-preserving. Empirically, monotonicity substantially improves robustness: adversarial attack success rates drop from approximately 69% to 19%, while standard summarization performance degrades only marginally."}

A multimodal transportation system that integrates both air and ground vehicles can leverage the strengths of each to enhance overall transportation efficiency. This study introduces a constructive greedy heuristic algorithm for multimodal vehicle dispatching for medical transportation. Four different fleet configurations were tested: (i) ambulances only, (ii) ambulances with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, (iii) ambulances with electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft, and (iv) a fully integrated fleet of ambulances, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, and electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft. The algorithm incorporates payload consolidation across compatible routes, accounts for traffic congestion in ground operations and weather conditions in aerial operations, while enabling rapid vehicle dispatching compared to computationally intensive optimization models.

Yet many existing evaluations assume a \"clean interface\" where dynamics are specified and stable, tools and sensors are reliable, and success is captured by a single explicit objective-often overestimating real-world readiness. In practice, agents face underspecified rules, unreliable signals, shifting environments, and implicit, multi-stakeholder goals. The challenge is therefore not just solving tasks, but adapting while solving: deciding what to trust, what is wanted, when to verify, and when to fall back or escalate. We stress-test deployment-relevant robustness under four operational circumstances: partial observability, dynamic environments, noisy signals, and dynamic agent state. We benchmark agentic LLMs in a grid-based game with a simple goal but long-horizon execution. Episodes violate clean-interface assumptions yet remain solvable, forcing agents to infer rules, pay for information, adapt to environmental and internal shifts, and act cautiously under noise. Across five state-of-the-art LLM agents, we find large gaps between nominal task-solving and deployment-like robustness. Performance generally degrades as grid size and horizon increase, but rankings are unstable: weaker models can beat stronger ones when strategy matches the uncertainty regime. Despite no explicit instruction, agents trade off completion, efficiency, and penalty avoidance, suggesting partial objective inference.

Focusing on the expression of meaning -- semantic typology -- the present paper asks what factors are responsible for successful explanations in terms of efficient communication. Using the Information Bottleneck (IB) approach to formalizing this trade-off, we first demonstrate and analyze a correlation between optimality in the IB sense and a novel generalization of convexity to this setting. In a second experiment, we manipulate various modeling parameters in the IB framework to determine which factors drive the correlation between convexity and optimality. We find that the convexity of the communicative need distribution plays an especially important role. These results move beyond showing that efficient communication can explain aspects of semantic typology into explanations for why that is the case by identifying which underlying factors are responsible."}

However, existing routers implicitly assume a single fixed quality and cost per LLM for each query, ignoring that the same LLM's quality varies with its output length. This causes routers to exclude powerful LLMs when their estimated cost exceeds the budget, missing the opportunity that these LLMs could still deliver high quality at reduced cost with shorter outputs. To address this, we introduce R2-Router, which treats output length budget as a controllable variable and jointly selects the best LLM and length budget, enforcing the budget via length-constrained instructions. This enables R2-Router to discover that a powerful LLM with constrained output can outperform a weaker LLM at comparable cost-efficient configurations invisible to prior methods. Together with the router framework, we construct R2-Bench, the first routing dataset capturing LLM behavior across diverse output length budgets. Experiments show that R2-Router achieves state-of-the-art performance at 4-5x lower cost compared with existing routers. This work opens a new direction: routing as reasoning, where routers evolve from reactive selectors to deliberate reasoners that explore which LLM to use and at what cost budget."}

Existing approaches, rooted in Gradient Ascent (GA), often degrade general domain knowledge while relying on retention data or curated contrastive pairs, which can be either impractical or data and computationally prohibitive. Negative Preference Alignment has been explored for unlearning to tackle the limitations of GA, which, however, remains confined by its choice of reference model and shows undermined performance in realistic data settings. These limitations raise two key questions: i) Can we achieve effective unlearning that quantifies model confidence in undesirable knowledge and uses it to calibrate gradient updates more precisely, thus reducing catastrophic forgetting? ii) Can we make unlearning robust to data scarcity and length variation? We answer both questions affirmatively with CATNIP (Calibrated and Tokenized Negative Preference Alignment), a principled method that rescales unlearning effects in proportion to the model's token-level confidence, thus ensuring fine-grained control over forgetting. Extensive evaluations on MUSE and WMDP benchmarks demonstrated that our work enables effective unlearning without requiring retention data or contrastive unlearning response pairs, with stronger knowledge forgetting and preservation tradeoffs than state-of-the-art methods."}

We predict that the decision to ask a CQ depends on both contextual uncertainty and the cost of alternative actions, and that these factors interact: uncertainty should matter most when acting incorrectly is costly. We formalize this interaction in a computational model based on expected regret: how much an agent stands to lose by acting now rather than with full information. We test these predictions in two experiments, one examining purely linguistic responses to questions and another extending to choices between clarification and non-linguistic action. Taken together, our results suggest a rational tradeoff: humans tend to seek clarification proportional to the risk of substantial loss when acting under uncertainty."}

Discourse is highly relevant for open-ended or long-form text generation, yet this connection is under-explored in existing undergraduate curricula. We present a new course, \"Computational Discourse and Natural Language Generation\". The course is collaboratively designed by a team with complementary expertise and was offered for the first time in Fall 2025 as an upper-level undergraduate course, cross-listed between Linguistics and Computer Science. Our philosophy is to deeply integrate the theoretical and empirical aspects, and create an exploratory mindset inside the classroom and in the assignments.

We present HALT (Hallucination Assessment via Log-probs as Time series), a lightweight hallucination detector that leverages only the top-20 token log-probabilities from LLM generations as a time series. HALT uses a gated recurrent unit model combined with entropy-based features to learn model calibration bias, providing an extremely efficient alternative to large encoders. Unlike white-box approaches, HALT does not require access to hidden states or attention maps, relying only on output log-probabilities. Unlike black-box approaches, it operates on log-probs rather than surface-form text, which enables stronger domain generalization and compatibility with proprietary LLMs without requiring access to internal weights. To benchmark performance, we introduce HUB (Hallucination detection Unified Benchmark), which consolidates prior datasets into ten capabilities covering both reasoning tasks (Algorithmic, Commonsense, Mathematical, Symbolic, Code Generation) and general purpose skills (Chat, Data-to-Text, Question Answering, Summarization, World Knowledge). While being 30x smaller, HALT outperforms Lettuce, a fine-tuned modernBERT-base encoder, achieving a 60x speedup gain on HUB. HALT and HUB together establish an effective framework for hallucination detection across diverse LLM capabilities."}

However, equitable access does not ensure equitable interaction quality once a response is provided. In this paper, we conduct a controlled fairness audit examining how LLMs differ in tone, uncertainty, and linguistic framing across demographic identities after access is granted. Using a counterfactual prompt design, we evaluate GPT-4 and LLaMA-3.1-70B on career advice tasks while varying identity attributes along age, gender, and nationality. We assess access fairness through refusal analysis and measure interaction quality using automated linguistic metrics, including sentiment, politeness, and hedging. Identity-conditioned differences are evaluated using paired statistical tests. Both models exhibit zero refusal rates across all identities, indicating uniform access. Nevertheless, we observe systematic, model-specific disparities in interaction quality: GPT-4 expresses significantly higher hedging toward younger male users, while LLaMA exhibits broader sentiment variation across identity groups. These results show that fairness disparities can persist at the interaction level even when access is equal, motivating evaluation beyond refusal-based audits."}

A key capability in such settings is norm-based reference resolution (NBRR), where interpreting referential expressions requires inferring implicit normative expectations grounded in physical and social context. Yet it remains unclear whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can support this kind of reasoning. In this work, we introduce SNIC (Situated Norms in Context), a human-validated diagnostic testbed designed to probe how well state-of-the-art LLMs can extract and utilize normative principles relevant to NBRR. SNIC emphasizes physically grounded norms that arise in everyday tasks such as cleaning, tidying, and serving. Across a range of controlled evaluations, we find that even the strongest LLMs struggle to consistently identify and apply social norms, particularly when norms are implicit, underspecified, or in conflict. These findings reveal a blind spot in current LLMs and highlight a key challenge for deploying language-based systems in socially situated, embodied settings."}

This dependence renders supervision-heavy training paradigms increasingly unsustainable, with signs of diminishing scalability already evident in practice. To overcome this limitation, we introduce CPMöbius (CPMobius), a collaborative Coach-Player paradigm for data-free reinforcement learning of reasoning models. Unlike traditional adversarial self-play, CPMöbius, inspired by real world human sports collaboration and multi-agent collaboration, treats the Coach and Player as independent but cooperative roles. The Coach proposes instructions targeted at the Player's capability and receives rewards based on changes in the Player's performance, while the Player is rewarded for solving the increasingly instructive tasks generated by the Coach. This cooperative optimization loop is designed to directly enhance the Player's mathematical reasoning ability. Remarkably, CPMöbius achieves substantial improvement without relying on any external training data, outperforming existing unsupervised approaches. For example, on Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct, our method improves accuracy by an overall average of +4.9 and an out-of-distribution average of +5.4, exceeding RENT by +1.5 on overall accuracy and R-zero by +4.2 on OOD accuracy."}

To address these limitations, we propose LatentMem, a learnable multi-agent memory framework designed to customize agent-specific memories in a token-efficient manner. Specifically, LatentMem comprises an experience bank that stores raw interaction trajectories in a lightweight form, and a memory composer that synthesizes compact latent memories conditioned on retrieved experience and agent-specific contexts. Further, we introduce Latent Memory Policy Optimization (LMPO), which propagates task-level optimization signals through latent memories to the composer, encouraging it to produce compact and high-utility representations. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and mainstream MAS frameworks show that LatentMem achieves a performance gain of up to $19.36$% over vanilla settings and consistently outperforms existing memory architectures, without requiring any modifications to the underlying frameworks."}

As a hardware-agnostic and highly compatible technique, low-rank compression has been widely adopted. However, existing methods typically compress each layer independently by minimizing per-layer reconstruction error, overlooking a critical limitation: the reconstruction error propagates and accumulates through the network, which leads to amplified global deviations from the full-precision baseline. To address this, we propose Self-Adaptive Error Suppression SVD (SAES-SVD), a LLMs compression framework that jointly optimizes intra-layer reconstruction and inter-layer error compensation. SAES-SVD is composed of two novel components: (1) Cumulative Error-Aware Layer Compression (CEALC), which formulates the compression objective as a combination of local reconstruction and weighted cumulative error compensation. Based on it, we derive a closed-form low-rank solution relied on second-order activation statistics, which explicitly aligns each layer's output with its full-precision counterpart to compensate for accumulated errors. (2) Adaptive Collaborative Error Suppression (ACES), which automatically adjusts the weighting coefficient to enhance the low-rank structure of the compression objective in CEALC. Specifically, the coefficient is optimized to maximize the ratio between the Frobenius norm of the compressed layer's output and that of the compression objective under a fixed rank, thus ensuring that the rank budget is utilized effectively. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures and tasks show that, without fine-tuning or mixed-rank strategies, SAES-SVD consistently improves post-compression performance."}

However, the potential for a bidirectional process--where insights from post-training retroactively improve the pre-trained foundation--remains unexplored. We aim to establish a self-reinforcing flywheel: a cycle in which reinforcement learning (RL)-tuned model strengthens the base model, which in turn enhances subsequent post-training performance, requiring no specially trained teacher or reference model. To realize this, we analyze training dynamics and identify the mid-training (annealing) phase as a critical turning point for model capabilities. This phase typically occurs at the end of pre-training, utilizing high-quality corpora under a rapidly decaying learning rate. Building upon this insight, we introduce ReMiT (Reinforcement Learning-Guided Mid-Training). Specifically, ReMiT leverages the reasoning priors of RL-tuned models to dynamically reweight tokens during the mid-training phase, prioritizing those pivotal for reasoning. Empirically, ReMiT achieves an average improvement of 3\\% on 10 pre-training benchmarks, spanning math, code, and general reasoning, and sustains these gains by over 2\\% throughout the post-training pipeline.

To tackle this longstanding bottleneck and the rising risks, we present Privasis (i.e., privacy oasis), the first million-scale fully synthetic dataset entirely built from scratch--an expansive reservoir of texts with rich and diverse private information--designed to broaden and accelerate research in areas where processing sensitive social data is inevitable. Compared to existing datasets, Privasis, comprising 1.4 million records, offers orders-of-magnitude larger scale with quality, and far greater diversity across various document types, including medical history, legal documents, financial records, calendars, and text messages with a total of 55.1 million annotated attributes such as ethnicity, date of birth, workplace, etc. We leverage Privasis to construct a parallel corpus for text sanitization with our pipeline that decomposes texts and applies targeted sanitization. Our compact sanitization models (<=4B) trained on this dataset outperform state-of-the-art large language models, such as GPT-5 and Qwen-3 235B. We plan to release data, models, and code to accelerate future research on privacy-sensitive domains and agents."}

However, as the sequence length grows, the key-value (KV) cache expands linearly, incurring significant memory and computation costs. Existing KV cache eviction methods mitigate this issue by discarding less important KV pairs, but often fail to capture complex KV dependencies, resulting in performance degradation. To better balance efficiency and performance, we introduce ForesightKV, a training-based KV cache eviction framework that learns to predict which KV pairs to evict during long-text generations. We first design the Golden Eviction algorithm, which identifies the optimal eviction KV pairs at each step using future attention scores. These traces and the scores at each step are then distilled via supervised training with a Pairwise Ranking Loss. Furthermore, we formulate cache eviction as a Markov Decision Process and apply the GRPO algorithm to mitigate the significant language modeling loss increase on low-entropy tokens. Experiments on AIME2024 and AIME2025 benchmarks of three reasoning models demonstrate that ForesightKV consistently outperforms prior methods under only half the cache budget, while benefiting synergistically from both supervised and reinforcement learning approaches."}

Prior acceleration methods either sparsify the attention map with structured patterns or permanently evict tokens at specific layers, which can retain irrelevant tokens or rely on irreversible early decisions despite the layer-/head-wise dynamics of token importance. In this paper, we propose Token Sparse Attention, a lightweight and dynamic token-level sparsification mechanism that compresses per-head $Q$, $K$, $V$ to a reduced token set during attention and then decompresses the output back to the original sequence, enabling token information to be reconsidered in subsequent layers. Furthermore, Token Sparse Attention exposes a new design point at the intersection of token selection and sparse attention. Our approach is fully compatible with dense attention implementations, including Flash Attention, and can be seamlessly composed with existing sparse attention kernels. Experimental results show that Token Sparse Attention consistently improves accuracy-latency trade-off, achieving up to $\\times$3.23 attention speedup at 128K context with less than 1% accuracy degradation. These results demonstrate that dynamic and interleaved token-level sparsification is a complementary and effective strategy for scalable long-context inference."}

ATACompressor employs a selective encoder that compresses only the task-relevant portions of long contexts, ensuring that essential information is preserved while reducing unnecessary content. Its adaptive allocation controller perceives the length of relevant content and adjusts the compression rate accordingly, optimizing resource utilization. We evaluate ATACompressor on three QA datasets: HotpotQA, MSMARCO, and SQUAD-showing that it outperforms existing methods in terms of both compression efficiency and task performance.

By introducing a virtual gate mechanism, our importance analysis reveals that deep layers are critical for next-token prediction (decode) but largely redundant for context encoding (prefill). Leveraging this insight, we propose Prefill-Only Pruning (POP), a stage-aware inference strategy that safely omits deep layers during the computationally intensive prefill stage while retaining the full model for the sensitive decode stage. To enable the transition between stages, we introduce independent Key-Value (KV) projections to maintain cache integrity, and a boundary handling strategy to ensure the accuracy of the first generated token. Extensive experiments on Llama-3.1, Qwen3-VL, and Gemma-3 across diverse modalities demonstrate that POP achieves up to 1.37$\\times$ speedup in prefill latency with minimal performance loss, effectively overcoming the accuracy-efficiency trade-off limitations of existing structured pruning methods."}

Based on this insight, we propose a pre-deployment test that uses a small pilot of 50 tasks to estimate whether intervention is likely to help or harm, without requiring full deployment. Across benchmarks, the test correctly anticipates outcomes: intervention degrades performance on high-success tasks (0 to -26 pp), while yielding a modest improvement on the high-failure ALFWorld benchmark (+2.8 pp, p=0.014). The primary value of our framework is therefore identifying when not to intervene, preventing severe regressions before deployment."}

We characterize distillation-relevant information in teacher outputs using the conditional mutual information (CMI) between teacher logits and input queries conditioned on ground-truth labels. This quantity captures contextual information beneficial for model extraction, motivating us to defend distillation via CMI minimization.

Prior work faces fundamental challenges: outcome-only rewards fail to precisely attribute credit to intermediate steps, estimated step-level rewards introduce systematic noise, and Monte Carlo sampling approaches for step reward estimation incur prohibitive computational cost. Inspired by findings that only a small fraction of high-entropy tokens drive effective RL for reasoning, we propose Critical Step Optimization (CSO), which focuses preference learning on verified critical steps, decision points where alternate actions demonstrably flip task outcomes from failure to success. Crucially, our method starts from failed policy trajectories rather than expert demonstrations, directly targeting the policy model's weaknesses. We use a process reward model (PRM) to identify candidate critical steps, leverage expert models to propose high-quality alternatives, then continue execution from these alternatives using the policy model itself until task completion. Only alternatives that the policy successfully executes to correct outcomes are verified and used as DPO training data, ensuring both quality and policy reachability. This yields fine-grained, verifiable supervision at critical decisions while avoiding trajectory-level coarseness and step-level noise. Experiments on GAIA-Text-103 and XBench-DeepSearch show that CSO achieves 37% and 26% relative improvement over the SFT baseline and substantially outperforms other post-training methods, while requiring supervision at only 16% of trajectory steps. This demonstrates the effectiveness of selective verification-based learning for agent post-training."}

Neither paradigm allows the model to participate in retrieval decisions, preventing efficient scaling with model improvements.

For linguistic acceptability, we adapt existing benchmarks into a minimal-pair format. To assess idiomaticity, we introduce two novel datasets: one contrasting conventionalized idioms with plausible variants, and another contrasting idiomatic Swedish with Translationese. Our findings suggest that idiomatic competence emerges more slowly than other linguistic abilities, including grammatical and lexical correctness. While longer training yields diminishing returns for most tasks, idiom-related performance continues to improve, particularly in the largest model tested (8B). However, instruction tuning on data machine-translated from English -- the common approach for languages with little or no native instruction data -- causes models to rapidly lose their preference for idiomatic language."}

This reveals a mismatch between how often self-verification is activated and how often it is actually useful.

Our method detects the activation of recheck behavior, consults an offline experience pool of past verification outcomes, and estimates whether a recheck is likely unnecessary via efficient retrieval. When historical experience suggests unnecessary, a suppression signal redirects the model to proceed.

We find that training LLMs with popular post-training methods on graphs or code data alone does not reliably generalize to corresponding natural language tasks, while training solely on natural language can lead to inefficient performance gains. To address this gap, we propose a two-stage data curriculum that first trains on symbolic, then natural language data. The curriculum substantially improves model performance across model families and tasks. Remarkably, a 1.5B Qwen model trained by our method can closely match zero-shot GPT-4o in naturalistic planning.

We expand on this line of work by analyzing two large pre-trained multilingual translation models, NLLB-200 and Tower+, which are state-of-the-art representatives of encoder-decoder and decoder-only machine translation, respectively. Based on a broad set of languages, we find that target language typology drives translation quality of both models, even after controlling for more trivial factors, such as data resourcedness and writing script.

This architecture resolves two fundamental limitations of prior sparse attention methods. First, conventional approaches typically rely on additional proxies to predict token importance, introducing extra complexity and potentially suboptimal performance. In contrast, HySparse uses the full attention layer as a precise oracle to identify important tokens. Second, existing sparse attention designs often reduce computation without saving KV cache. HySparse enables sparse attention layers to reuse the full attention KV cache, thereby reducing both computation and memory. We evaluate HySparse on both 7B dense and 80B MoE models. Across all settings, HySparse consistently outperforms both full attention and hybrid SWA baselines.

Graph-augmented RAG (GraphRAG) emerged to enhance contextual reasoning through structured knowledge graphs, yet paradoxically underperforms vanilla RAG in real-world scenarios, exhibiting significant accuracy drops and prohibitive latency despite gains on complex queries. We identify the rigid application of GraphRAG to all queries, regardless of complexity, as the root cause. To resolve this, we propose an efficient and adaptive GraphRAG framework called EA-GraphRAG that dynamically integrates RAG and GraphRAG paradigms through syntax-aware complexity analysis. Our approach introduces: (i) a syntactic feature constructor that parses each query and extracts a set of structural features; (ii) a lightweight complexity scorer that maps these features to a continuous complexity score; and (iii) a score-driven routing policy that selects dense RAG for low-score queries, invokes graph-based retrieval for high-score queries, and applies complexity-aware reciprocal rank fusion to handle borderline cases. Extensive experiments on a comprehensive benchmark, consisting of two single-hop and two multi-hop QA benchmarks, demonstrate that our EA-GraphRAG significantly improves accuracy, reduces latency, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in handling mixed scenarios involving both simple and complex queries."}

In the training of Large Language Models (LLMs) using Actor-Critic methods (e.g., PPO), this baseline is typically estimated by a Value Model (Critic) often as large as the policy model itself. However, as the policy continuously evolves, the value model requires expensive, synchronous incremental training to accurately track the shifting capabilities of the policy. To avoid this overhead, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) eliminates the coupled value model by using the average reward of a group of rollouts as the baseline; yet, this approach necessitates extensive sampling to maintain estimation stability. In this paper, we propose $V_0$, a Generalist Value Model capable of estimating the expected performance of any model on unseen prompts without requiring parameter updates. We reframe value estimation by treating the policy's dynamic capability as an explicit context input; specifically, we leverage a history of instruction-performance pairs to dynamically profile the model, departing from the traditional paradigm that relies on parameter fitting to perceive capability shifts. Focusing on value estimation at State Zero (i.e., the initial prompt, hence $V_0$), our model serves as a critical resource scheduler. During GRPO training, $V_0$ predicts success rates prior to rollout, allowing for efficient sampling budget allocation; during deployment, it functions as a router, dispatching instructions to the most cost-effective and suitable model. Empirical results demonstrate that $V_0$ significantly outperforms heuristic budget allocation and achieves a Pareto-optimal trade-off between performance and cost in LLM routing tasks."}

However, real-world tasks are far more complex and context-dependent: models must learn from task-specific context and leverage new knowledge beyond what is learned during pre-training to reason and resolve tasks. We term this capability context learning, a crucial ability that humans naturally possess but has been largely overlooked. To this end, we introduce CL-bench, a real-world benchmark consisting of 500 complex contexts, 1,899 tasks, and 31,607 verification rubrics, all crafted by experienced domain experts. Each task is designed such that the new content required to resolve it is contained within the corresponding context. Resolving tasks in CL-bench requires models to learn from the context, ranging from new domain-specific knowledge, rule systems, and complex procedures to laws derived from empirical data, all of which are absent from pre-training. This goes far beyond long-context tasks that primarily test retrieval or reading comprehension, and in-context learning tasks, where models learn simple task patterns via instructions and demonstrations. Our evaluations of ten frontier LMs find that models solve only 17.2% of tasks on average. Even the best-performing model, GPT-5.1, solves only 23.7%, revealing that LMs have yet to achieve effective context learning, which poses a critical bottleneck for tackling real-world, complex context-dependent tasks. CL-bench represents a step towards building LMs with this fundamental capability, making them more intelligent and advancing their deployment in real-world scenarios."}

PCSP serves as a generalization of the well-known Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). In the CSP framework, we define a set of variables, a set of constraints, and a finite domain $D$ that encompasses all possible values for each variable. The objective is to assign a value to each variable in such a way that all constraints are satisfied. In the graph variant of CSP, an underlying graph is considered and we have one variable corresponding to each vertex of the graph and one or several constraints corresponding to each edge. In PCSPs, we allow for certain constraints to be violated at a specified cost, aiming to find a solution that minimizes the total cost. Numerous classical compiler optimization tasks can be framed as PCSPs over control-flow graphs. Examples include Register Allocation, Lifetime-optimal Speculative Partial Redundancy Elimination (LOSPRE), and Optimal Placement of Bank Selection Instructions. On the other hand, it is well-known that control-flow graphs of structured programs are sparse and decomposable in a variety of ways. In this work, we rely on the Series-Parallel-Loop (SPL) decompositions as introduced by~\\cite{RegisterAllocation}. Our main contribution is a general algorithm for PCSPs over SPL graphs with a time complexity of \\(O(|G| \\cdot |D|^6)\\), where \\(|G|\\) represents the size of the control-flow graph. Note that for any fixed domain $D,$ this yields a linear-time solution. Our algorithm can be seen as a generalization and unification of previous SPL-based approaches for register allocation and LOSPRE. In addition, we provide experimental results over another classical PCSP task, i.e. Optimal Bank Selection, achieving runtimes four times better than the previous state of the art."}

We introduce three types of optimization content: string-based, reasoning-based, and review-based, demonstrating their effectiveness in shaping output rankings.

In this paper, we propose a pipeline to train human-preference-aligned query-specific rubric generators tailored for DeepResearch report generation. We first construct a dataset of DeepResearch-style queries annotated with human preferences over paired reports, and train rubric generators via reinforcement learning with a hybrid reward combining human preference supervision and LLM-based rubric evaluation. To better handle long-horizon reasoning, we further introduce a Multi-agent Markov-state (MaMs) workflow for report generation. We empirically show that our proposed rubric generators deliver more discriminative and better human-aligned supervision than existing rubric design strategies. Moreover, when integrated into the MaMs training framework, DeepResearch systems equipped with our rubric generators consistently outperform all open-source baselines on the DeepResearch Bench and achieve performance comparable to that of leading closed-source models."}

To address this, we propose Trust Region Entropy (TRE), a method that encourages exploration strictly within the model's trust region. Extensive experiments across mathematical reasoning (MATH), combinatorial search (Countdown), and preference alignment (HH) tasks demonstrate that TRE consistently outperforms vanilla PPO, standard entropy regularization, and other exploration baselines.

It is fundamental to ensuring safety and reliability in real-world deployments. However, the underlying mechanisms governing this decision-making process remain poorly understood. In this paper, we investigate its working mechanism through an information flow lens. Our findings reveal that instruction tokens function as structural anchors for modality arbitration: Shallow attention layers perform non-selective information transfer, routing multimodal cues to these anchors as a latent buffer; Modality competition is resolved within deep attention layers guided by the instruction intent, while MLP layers exhibit semantic inertia, acting as an adversarial force. Furthermore, we identify a sparse set of specialized attention heads that drive this arbitration. Causal interventions demonstrate that manipulating a mere $5\\%$ of these critical heads can decrease the modality-following ratio by $60\\%$ through blocking, or increase it by $60\\%$ through targeted amplification of failed samples.

However, their expressivity remains limited by the size of their hidden state. Previous work proposed interleaving softmax and linear attention layers to reduce computational complexity while preserving expressivity. Nevertheless, the efficiency of these models remains bottlenecked by their softmax attention layers. In this paper, we propose Neural Attention Search Linear (NAtS-L), a framework that applies both linear attention and softmax attention operations within the same layer on different tokens. NAtS-L automatically determines whether a token can be handled by a linear attention model, i.e., tokens that have only short-term impact and can be encoded into fixed-size hidden states, or require softmax attention, i.e., tokens that contain information related to long-term retrieval and need to be preserved for future queries.

A key reason is that retrievers and rerankers optimize solely for relevance, often selecting either trivial, answer-revealing passages or evidence that lacks the critical information required to answer the question, without considering whether the evidence is suitable for the generator. We propose BAR-RAG, which reframes the reranker as a boundary-aware evidence selector that targets the generator's Goldilocks Zone -- evidence that is neither trivially easy nor fundamentally unanswerable for the generator, but is challenging yet sufficient for inference and thus provides the strongest learning signal. BAR-RAG trains the selector with reinforcement learning using generator feedback, and adopts a two-stage pipeline that fine-tunes the generator under the induced evidence distribution to mitigate the distribution mismatch between training and inference. Experiments on knowledge-intensive question answering benchmarks show that BAR-RAG consistently improves end-to-end performance under noisy retrieval, achieving an average gain of 10.3 percent over strong RAG and reranking baselines while substantially improving robustness.

ReQUESTA decomposes MCQ authoring into specialized subtasks and coordinates LLM-powered agents with rule-based components to support planning, controlled generation, iterative evaluation, and post-processing. We evaluated the framework in a large-scale reading comprehension study using academic expository texts, comparing ReQUESTA-generated MCQs with those produced by a single-pass GPT-5 zero-shot baseline. Psychometric analyses of learner responses assessed item difficulty and discrimination, while expert raters evaluated question quality across multiple dimensions, including topic relevance and distractor quality. Results showed that ReQUESTA-generated items were consistently more challenging, more discriminative, and more strongly aligned with overall reading comprehension performance. Expert evaluations further indicated stronger alignment with central concepts and superior distractor linguistic consistency and semantic plausibility, particularly for inferential questions.

In this work, we study soft context compression, where a long context is condensed into a small set of continuous representations. Existing methods typically re-purpose the LLM itself as a trainable compressor, relying on layer-by-layer self-attention to iteratively aggregate information. We argue that this paradigm suffers from two structural limitations: (i) progressive representation overwriting across layers (ii) uncoordinated allocation of compression capacity across tokens. We propose ComprExIT (Context Compression via Explicit Information Transmission), a lightweight framework that formulates soft compression into a new paradigm: explicit information transmission over frozen LLM hidden states. This decouples compression from the model's internal self-attention dynamics. ComprExIT performs (i) depth-wise transmission to selectively transmit multi-layer information into token anchors, mitigating progressive overwriting, and (ii) width-wise transmission to aggregate anchors into a small number of slots via a globally optimized transmission plan, ensuring coordinated allocation of information. Across six question-answering benchmarks, ComprExIT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art context compression methods while introducing only ~1% additional parameters, demonstrating that explicit and coordinated information transmission enables more effective and robust long-context compression."}

Although existing methods can generate full-body talking avatars with simple human motion, extending this task to grounded human-object interaction (GHOI) remains an open challenge, requiring the avatar to perform text-aligned interactions with surrounding objects. This challenge stems from the need for environmental perception and the control-quality dilemma in GHOI generation. To address this, we propose a novel dual-stream framework, InteractAvatar, which decouples perception and planning from video synthesis for grounded human-object interaction. Leveraging detection to enhance environmental perception, we introduce a Perception and Interaction Module (PIM) to generate text-aligned interaction motions. Additionally, an Audio-Interaction Aware Generation Module (AIM) is proposed to synthesize vivid talking avatars performing object interactions. With a specially designed motion-to-video aligner, PIM and AIM share a similar network structure and enable parallel co-generation of motions and plausible videos, effectively mitigating the control-quality dilemma. Finally, we establish a benchmark, GroundedInter, for evaluating GHOI video generation. Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in generating grounded human-object interactions for talking avatars.

Since evaluating the system requires a realistic patient simulator that responds to the system's questions, we adopt a well-established simulator along with patient profiles from MIMIC-IV.

However, these scores often fail to match users' day to day experience, because system prompts, output protocols, and interaction modes evolve under routine iteration, and in agentic multi step pipelines small protocol shifts can trigger disproportionate failures, leaving practitioners uncertain about which model to deploy. We propose CreditAudit, a deployment oriented credit audit framework that evaluates models under a family of semantically aligned and non adversarial system prompt templates across multiple benchmarks, reporting mean ability as average performance across scenarios and scenario induced fluctuation sigma as a stability risk signal, and further mapping volatility into interpretable credit grades from AAA to BBB via cross model quantiles with diagnostics that mitigate template difficulty drift. Controlled experiments on GPQA, TruthfulQA, and MMLU Pro show that models with similar mean ability can exhibit substantially different fluctuation, and stability risk can overturn prioritization decisions in agentic or high failure cost regimes. By providing a 2D and grade based language for regime specific selection, CreditAudit supports tiered deployment and more disciplined allocation of testing and monitoring effort, enabling more objective and trustworthy model evaluation for real world use."}

We propose GraphDancer, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that teaches LLMs to navigate graphs by interleaving reasoning and function execution. To make RL effective for moderate-sized LLMs, we introduce a graph-aware curriculum that schedules training by the structural complexity of information-seeking trajectories using an easy-to-hard biased sampler.

This phenomenon represents a total collapse of the latent manifold (Global Effective Rank 3.62 -> 2.22), where the model discards diverse world knowledge to optimize for statistically safe syntactic templates. To address this, we apply the Multi-Scale Negative Coupled Information Systems (MNCIS) framework recently established in Hou (2026) [arXiv:2601.11594]. We demonstrate that Adaptive Spectral Negative Coupling (ASNC) acts as a topological operator that actively induces \"Manifold Unfolding.\" MNCIS forces the model to expand its effective rank from the anisotropic baseline of 3.62 to a hyper-diverse state of 5.35, effectively constructing an \"Artificial Manifold\" that resists the gravitational pull of semantic attractors and preserves the long-tail distribution of the training data."}

Despite the success of textual safety moderation, its multimodal counterparts remain hindered by a dual sparsity of data and supervision. Conventional reliance on binary labels lead to shortcut learning, which obscures the intrinsic classification boundaries necessary for effective multimodal discrimination. Hence, we propose a novel learning paradigm (UniMod) that transitions from sparse decision-making to dense reasoning traces. By constructing structured trajectories encompassing evidence grounding, modality assessment, risk mapping, policy decision, and response generation, we reformulate monolithic decision tasks into a multi-dimensional boundary learning process. This approach forces the model to ground its decision in explicit safety semantics, preventing the model from converging on superficial shortcuts. To facilitate this paradigm, we develop a multi-head scalar reward model (UniRM). UniRM provides multi-dimensional supervision by assigning attribute-level scores to the response generation stage. Furthermore, we introduce specialized optimization strategies to decouple task-specific parameters and rebalance training dynamics, effectively resolving interference between diverse objectives in multi-task learning. Empirical results show UniMod achieves competitive textual moderation performance and sets a new multimodal benchmark using less than 40\\% of the training data used by leading baselines. Ablations further validate our multi-attribute trajectory reasoning, offering an effective and efficient framework for multimodal moderation.

To overcome these issues, we propose Future-Aware Quantization (FAQ), which leverages future-layer activations to guide quantization. This allows better identification and preservation of important weights, while reducing sensitivity to calibration noise. We further introduce a window-wise preview mechanism to softly aggregate multiple future-layer activations, mitigating over-reliance on any single layer. To avoid expensive greedy search, we use a pre-searched configuration to minimize overhead.

In SALE, agents bid with short strategic plans, which are scored by a systematic cost-value mechanism and refined via a shared auction memory, enabling per-task routing and continual self-improvement without training a separate router or running all models to completion. Across deep search and coding tasks of varying complexity, SALE reduces reliance on the largest agent by 53%, lowers overall cost by 35%, and consistently improves upon the largest agent's pass@1 with only a negligible overhead beyond executing the final trace. In contrast, established routers that rely on task descriptions either underperform the largest agent or fail to reduce cost -- often both -- underscoring their poor fit for agentic workflows. These results suggest that while small agents may be insufficient for complex workloads, they can be effectively \"scaled up\" through coordinated task allocation and test-time self-improvement. More broadly, they motivate a systems-level view of agentic AI in which performance gains come less from ever-larger individual models and more from market-inspired coordination mechanisms that organize heterogeneous agents into efficient, adaptive ecosystems."}

This perspective neglects the temporal complexity in longitudinal datasets, such as electronic health records, where a user contributes an entire (sub) table of sequential events. While practitioners might attempt to model such data by flattening user histories into high-dimensional vectors for use with standard marginal-based mechanisms, we demonstrate that this strategy is insufficient. Flattening fails to preserve temporal coherence even when it maintains valid marginal distributions. We introduce PATH, a novel generative framework that treats the full table as the unit of synthesis and leverages the autoregressive capabilities of privately fine-tuned large language models. Extensive evaluations show that PATH effectively captures long-range dependencies that traditional methods miss. Empirically, our method reduces the distributional distance to real trajectories by over 60% and reduces state transition errors by nearly 50% compared to leading marginal mechanisms while achieving similar marginal fidelity."}

Through comprehensive evaluation on GSM8K, StrategyQA, and bAbI benchmarks using four state-of-the-art models (Gemma-3 27B, LLaMA-3.1 8B, Mistral 7B, and Qwen-2.5 14B), we demonstrate that CoS achieves 71.5% accuracy on GSM8K (1.0% absolute improvement), 90.0% on StrategyQA (2.5% improvement), and 19.0% on bAbI (65.2% relative improvement) compared to the strongest baselines. The analysis reveals that problem-specific mode selection is crucial, with computational mode achieving 81.2% accuracy when correctly applied to mathematical problems, while misrouting leads to 0% accuracy.

The varying sensitivity of LLM sub-blocks to pruning necessitates the identification of optimal non-uniformly pruned models. Existing methods evaluate the importance of layers, attention heads, or weight channels in isolation. Such localized focus ignores the complex global structural dependencies that exist across the model. Training-aware structured pruning addresses global dependencies, but its computational cost can be just as expensive as post-pruning training. To alleviate the computational burden of training-aware pruning and capture global structural dependencies, we propose TraceNAS, a training-free Neural Architecture Search (NAS) framework that jointly explores structured pruning of LLM depth and width. TraceNAS identifies pruned models that maintain a high degree of loss landscape alignment with the pretrained model using a scale-invariant zero-shot proxy, effectively selecting models that exhibit maximal performance potential during post-pruning training. TraceNAS is highly efficient, enabling high-fidelity discovery of pruned models on a single GPU in 8.5 hours, yielding a 10$\\times$ reduction in GPU-hours compared to training-aware methods. Evaluations on the Llama and Qwen families demonstrate that TraceNAS is competitive with training-aware baselines across commonsense and reasoning benchmarks."}

We then propose BenchAlign, the first solution to this problem, which learns preference-aligned weight- ings for benchmark questions using the question-level performance of language models alongside ranked pairs of models that could be collected during deployment, producing new benchmarks that rank previously unseen models according to these preferences.

We propose the WST-X series, a novel family of feature extractors that combines the best of both worlds via the wavelet scattering transform (WST), integrating wavelets with nonlinearities analogous to deep convolutional networks. We investigate 1D and 2D WSTs to extract acoustic details and higher-order structural anomalies, respectively.

To address this problem, we propose RC-GRPO (Reward-Conditioned Group Relative Policy Optimization), which treats exploration as a controllable steering problem via discrete reward tokens. We first fine-tune a Reward-Conditioned Trajectory Policy (RCTP) on mixed-quality trajectories with reward goal special tokens (e.g., <|high_reward|>, <|low_reward|>) injected into the prompts, enabling the model to learn how to generate distinct quality trajectories on demand.

To fill this gap, we present MAS-ProVe, a systematic empirical study of process verification for multi-agent systems (MAS). Our study spans three verification paradigms (LLM-as-a-Judge, reward models, and process reward models), evaluated across two levels of verification granularity (agent-level and iteration-level). We further examine five representative verifiers and four context management strategies, and conduct experiments over six diverse MAS frameworks on multiple reasoning benchmarks. We find that process-level verification does not consistently improve performance and frequently exhibits high variance, highlighting the difficulty of reliably evaluating partial multi-agent trajectories. Among the methods studied, LLM-as-a-Judge generally outperforms reward-based approaches, with trained judges surpassing general-purpose LLMs. We further observe a small performance gap between LLMs acting as judges and as single agents, and identify a context-length-performance trade-off in verification.

Motivated by our formative study of speech referencing patterns, we characterize recurring ways people specify targets (Direct Attribute, Relational, Remembrance, and Chained) and ground them to our object-centric relational graph. Given an utterance, referent cues are parsed and rendered as persistent in-situ AR visual guidance, reducing iterative micro-guidance (\"a bit more to the right\", \"now, stop.\") during remote guidance. We demonstrate the use cases of our system with remote guided assistance and intent disambiguation scenarios. Our evaluation shows that Speechto-Spatial improves task efficiency, reduces cognitive load, and enhances usability compared to a conventional voice-only baseline, transforming disembodied verbal instruction into visually explainable, actionable guidance on a live shared view."}

However, under sparse terminal rewards, GRPO often stalls because rollouts within a group frequently receive identical rewards, causing relative advantages to collapse and updates to vanish. We propose self-hint aligned GRPO with privileged supervision (SAGE), an on-policy reinforcement learning framework that injects privileged hints during training to reshape the rollout distribution under the same terminal verifier reward. For each prompt $x$, the model samples a compact hint $h$ (e.g., a plan or decomposition) and then generates a solution $τ$ conditioned on $(x,h)$. Crucially, the task reward $R(x,τ)$ is unchanged; hints only increase within-group outcome diversity under finite sampling, preventing GRPO advantages from collapsing under sparse rewards. At test time, we set $h=\\varnothing$ and deploy the no-hint policy without any privileged information. Moreover, sampling diverse self-hints serves as an adaptive curriculum that tracks the learner's bottlenecks more effectively than fixed hints from an initial policy or a stronger external model. Experiments over 6 benchmarks with 3 LLMs show that SAGE consistently outperforms GRPO, on average +2.0 on Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, +1.2 on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and +1.3 on Qwen3-4B-Instruct.

To address these limitations, we introduce VALUEFLOW, the first unified framework that spans extraction, evaluation, and steering with calibrated intensity control. The framework integrates three components: (i) HIVES, a hierarchical value embedding space that captures intra- and cross-theory value structure; (ii) the Value Intensity DataBase (VIDB), a large-scale resource of value-labeled texts with intensity estimates derived from ranking-based aggregation; and (iii) an anchor-based evaluator that produces consistent intensity scores for model outputs by ranking them against VIDB panels.

We observe that rigid splitting suffers from significant accuracy degradation (ranging from 5.5% to 55.1%) across different scenarios, owing to the scenario-dependent nature of the semantic boundaries. This highlights the necessity of dynamic semantic splitting to match semantics. To achieve this, we face two challenges. (1) Improper delimiter selection misaligns semantics with the KVCache, resulting in 28.6% accuracy loss. (2) Variable-length blocks after splitting introduce over 73.1% additional inference overhead. To address the above challenges, we propose DynSplit-KV, a KVCache compression method that dynamically identifies delimiters for splitting.

As a result, most existing approaches restrict training to short horizons (typically 5-20 epochs), limiting sustained exploration and hindering further policy improvement. In addition, nearly all prior work relies on a single, fixed reasoning prompt or template during training. In this work, we introduce prompt augmentation, a training strategy that instructs the model to generate reasoning traces under diverse templates and formats, thereby increasing rollout diversity. We show that, without a KL regularization term, prompt augmentation enables stable scaling of training duration under a fixed dataset and allows the model to tolerate low-entropy regimes without premature collapse. Empirically, a Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B model trained with prompt augmentation on the MATH Level 3-5 dataset achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 44.5 per-benchmark accuracy and 51.3 per-question accuracy on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME24, AMC, MATH500, Minerva, and OlympiadBench.

Remarkably, ARM requires only early SFT checkpoints and, through iterative merging, surpasses the fully converged SFT model.

However, as models often learn tasks in a similar order, we hypothesize that easier tasks will be easier regardless of how they are presented to the model. Indeed, in this paper, we show that as models approach high performance on a task, robustness is effectively achieved. Through an empirical analysis of multiple models across diverse datasets and configurations (e.g., paraphrases, different temperatures), we find a strong positive correlation. Moreover, we find that robustness is primarily driven by task-specific competence rather than inherent model-level properties, challenging current approaches that treat robustness as an independent capability. Thus, from a high-level perspective, we may expect that as new tasks saturate, model robustness on these tasks will emerge accordingly. For researchers, this implies that explicit efforts to measure and improve robustness may warrant reduced emphasis, as such robustness is likely to develop alongside performance gains. For practitioners, it acts as a sign that indeed the tasks that the literature deals with are unreliable, but on easier past tasks, the models are reliable and ready for real-world deployment."}

Across few-shot text classification, instruction induction benchmarks, and question answering tasks, GFlowPO consistently outperforms recent discrete prompt optimization baselines."}

However, these strategies are impractical for edge device deployment due to limited RAM and NPU resources. Despite hardware constraints, deploying performant LLM on edge devices such as smartphone remains crucial for user experience. To address this, we propose MeKi (Memory-based Expert Knowledge Injection), a novel system that scales LLM capacity via storage space rather than FLOPs. MeKi equips each Transformer layer with token-level memory experts that injects pre-stored semantic knowledge into the generation process. To bridge the gap between training capacity and inference efficiency, we employ a re-parameterization strategy to fold parameter matrices used during training into a compact static lookup table. By offloading the knowledge to ROM, MeKi decouples model capacity from computational cost, introducing zero inference latency overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MeKi significantly outperforms dense LLM baselines with identical inference speed, validating the effectiveness of memory-based scaling paradigm for on-device LLMs. Project homepage is at https://github.com/ningding-o/MeKi."}

We propose SWE-World, a Docker-free framework that replaces physical execution environments with a learned surrogate for training and evaluating software engineering agents. SWE-World leverages LLM-based models trained on real agent-environment interaction data to predict intermediate execution outcomes and final test feedback, enabling agents to learn without interacting with physical containerized environments. This design preserves the standard agent-environment interaction loop while eliminating the need for costly environment construction and maintenance during agent optimization and evaluation.

Simply asking \"what kind of tone do you want?\" fails when users themselves do not know. We introduce DiscoverLLM, a novel and generalizable framework that trains LLMs to help users form and discover their intents. Central to our approach is a novel user simulator that models cognitive state with a hierarchy of intents that progressively concretize as the model surfaces relevant options -- where the degree of concretization serves as a reward signal that models can be trained to optimize. Resulting models learn to collaborate with users by adaptively diverging (i.e., explore options) when intents are unclear, and converging (i.e., refine and implement) when intents concretize.

Yet many real-world information needs demand more: enforcement of logical constraints, multi-step inference, and synthesis of multiple pieces of evidence. Addressing these requirements is, at its core, a problem of reasoning. Across AI communities, researchers are developing diverse solutions for the problem of reasoning, from inference-time strategies and post-training of LLMs, to neuro-symbolic systems, Bayesian and probabilistic frameworks, geometric representations, and energy-based models. These efforts target the same problem: to move beyond pattern-matching systems toward structured, verifiable inference. However, they remain scattered across disciplines, making it difficult for IR researchers to identify the most relevant ideas and opportunities. To help navigate the fragmented landscape of research in reasoning, this tutorial first articulates a working definition of reasoning within the context of information retrieval and derives from it a unified analytical framework. The framework maps existing approaches along axes that reflect the core components of the definition. By providing a comprehensive overview of recent approaches and mapping current methods onto the defined axes, we expose their trade-offs and complementarities, highlight where IR can benefit from cross-disciplinary advances, and illustrate how retrieval process itself can play a central role in broader reasoning systems. The tutorial will equip participants with both a conceptual framework and practical guidance for enhancing reasoning-capable IR systems, while situating IR as a domain that both benefits and contributes to the broader development of reasoning methodologies."}

However, training these agents via reinforcement learning is hindered by the multi-scale credit assignment problem: existing methods typically rely on sparse, trajectory-level rewards that fail to distinguish between high-quality reasoning and fortuitous guesses, leading to redundant or misleading search behaviors. To address this, we propose Search-R2, a novel Actor-Refiner collaboration framework that enhances reasoning through targeted intervention, with both components jointly optimized during training. Our approach decomposes the generation process into an Actor, which produces initial reasoning trajectories, and a Meta-Refiner, which selectively diagnoses and repairs flawed steps via a 'cut-and-regenerate' mechanism. To provide fine-grained supervision, we introduce a hybrid reward design that couples outcome correctness with a dense process reward quantifying the information density of retrieved evidence. Theoretically, we formalize the Actor-Refiner interaction as a smoothed mixture policy, proving that selective correction yields strict performance gains over strong baselines. Extensive experiments across various general and multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that Search-R2 consistently outperforms strong RAG and RL-based baselines across model scales, achieving superior reasoning accuracy with minimal overhead."}

Inspired by neural network design, where complex models are built from reusable components, we observe that many existing MAS architectures can be decomposed into a small number of recurring internal computation patterns. Based on this observation, we instantiate three primitives: Review, Voting and Selection, and Planning and Execution. All primitives communicate internally via key-value (KV) cache, which improves both robustness and efficiency by mitigating information degradation across multi-stage interactions. To enable automatic system construction, an Organizer agent selects and composes primitives for each query, guided by a lightweight knowledge pool of previously successful configurations, forming a primitive-based MAS.\n  Experiments show that primitives-based MAS improve average accuracy by 12.0-16.5\\% over single-agent baselines, reduce token usage and inference latency by approximately 3$\\times$-4$\\times$ compared to text-based MAS, while incurring only 1.3$\\times$-1.6$\\times$ overhead relative to single-agent inference and providing more stable performance across model backbones."}

To address these limitations, we propose the CoRSA (Conflict-Resolving and Sharpness-Aware Minimization) training framework, a parameter-efficient, holistic approach for knowledge editing with multiple updates. CoRSA tackles multiple challenges simultaneously: it improves generalization to different input forms and enhances stability across multiple updates by minimizing loss curvature, and resolves conflicts by maximizing the margin between new and prior knowledge. Across three widely used fact editing benchmarks, CoRSA achieves significant gains in generalization, outperforming baselines with average absolute improvements of 12.42% over LoRA and 10% over model editing methods.

To appear in ICLR 2026", "summary": "Modern AI agents such as large language models are trained on diverse tasks -- translation, code generation, mathematical reasoning, and text prediction -- simultaneously. A key question is to quantify how each individual training task influences performance on a target task, a problem we refer to as task attribution. The direct approach, leave-one-out retraining, measures the effect of removing each task, but is computationally infeasible at scale. An alternative approach that builds surrogate models to predict a target task's performance for any subset of training tasks has emerged in recent literature. Prior work focuses on linear surrogate models, which capture first-order relationships, but miss nonlinear interactions such as synergy, antagonism, or XOR-type effects. In this paper, we first consider a unified task weighting framework for analyzing task attribution methods, and show a new connection between linear surrogate models and influence functions through a second-order analysis. Then, we introduce kernel surrogate models, which more effectively represent second-order task interactions. To efficiently learn the kernel surrogate, we develop a gradient-based estimation procedure that leverages a first-order approximation of pretrained models; empirically, this yields accurate estimates with less than $2\\%$ relative error without repeated retraining. Experiments across multiple domains -- including math reasoning in transformers, in-context learning, and multi-objective reinforcement learning -- demonstrate the effectiveness of kernel surrogate models. They achieve a $25\\%$ higher correlation with the leave-one-out ground truth than linear surrogates and influence-function baselines. When used for downstream task selection, kernel surrogate models yield a $40\\%$ improvement in demonstration selection for in-context learning and multi-objective reinforcement learning benchmarks."}

Realizing this promise for increasingly complex, long-horizon tasks has driven the rise of a sub-agent-as-tools paradigm for multi-turn task solving.

We address this challenge with a unified, framework-agnostic agent abstraction that models any agent as a tuple Instruction, Context, Tools, Model. This tuple acts as a compositional recipe for capabilities, enabling the system to spawn specialized executors for each task on demand. Building on this abstraction, we introduce an agentic system AOrchestra, where the central orchestrator concretizes the tuple at each step: it curates task-relevant context, selects tools and models, and delegates execution via on-the-fly automatic agent creation. Such designs enable reducing human engineering efforts, and remain framework-agnostic with plug-and-play support for diverse agents as task executors. It also enables a controllable performance-cost trade-off, allowing the system to approach Pareto-efficient.

Cobalt first collects code generation trajectories using a reference LLM and divides them into partial trajectories as contextual prompts.

We introduce antidistillation fingerprinting (ADFP), a principled approach that aligns the fingerprinting objective with the student's learning dynamics. Building upon the gradient-based framework of antidistillation sampling, ADFP utilizes a proxy model to identify and sample tokens that directly maximize the expected detectability of the fingerprint in the student after fine-tuning, rather than relying on the incidental absorption of the un-targeted biases of a more naive watermark.
