However,\nseveral challenges remain for diffusion-based methods: 1) inefficient inference\nand visual artifacts, which arise from the implicit latent space of Variational\nAuto-Encoders (VAE), complicating the diffusion process; 2) authentic facial\nexpressions and head movements, resulting from insufficient multi-modal\ninformation interaction. In this paper, MoDA handle these challenges by 1)\ndefines a joint parameter space to bridge motion generation and neural\nrendering, and leverages flow matching to simplify the diffusion learning\nprocess; 2) introduces a multi-modal diffusion architecture to model the\ninteraction among noisy motion, audio, and auxiliary conditions, ultimately\nenhancing overall facial expressiveness. Subsequently, a coarse-to-fine fusion\nstrategy is adopted to progressively integrate different modalities, ensuring\neffective integration across feature spaces.

However, automated data quality control faces\nunique challenges in collaborative settings where sharing is not allowed\ndirectly between data silos. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a novel\ndata quality control technique based on the notion of data influence on the\ntraining dynamics of LLMs, that high quality data are more likely to have\nsimilar training dynamics to the anchor dataset. We then leverage the influence\nof the training dynamics to select high-quality data from different private\ndomains, with centralized model updates on the server side in a collaborative\ntraining fashion by either model merging or federated learning. As for the data\nquality indicator, we compute the per-sample gradients with respect to the\nprivate data and the anchor dataset, and use the trace of the accumulated inner\nproducts as a measurement of data quality. In addition, we develop a quality\ncontrol evaluation tailored for collaborative settings with heterogeneous\ndomain data. Experiments show that training on the high-quality data selected\nby our method can often outperform other data selection methods for\ncollaborative fine-tuning of LLMs, across diverse private domain datasets, in\nmedical, multilingual and financial settings.

Objective: To develop and evaluate a\nprivacy-preserving, on-device medical transcription system using a fine-tuned\nLlama 3.2 1B model capable of generating structured medical notes from medical\ntranscriptions while maintaining complete data sovereignty entirely in the\nbrowser. Methods: We fine-tuned a Llama 3.2 1B model using Parameter-Efficient\nFine-Tuning (PEFT) with LoRA on 1,500 synthetic medical\ntranscription-to-structured note pairs. The model was evaluated against the\nbase Llama 3.2 1B on two datasets: 100 endocrinology transcripts and 140\nmodified ACI benchmark cases. Evaluation employed both statistical metrics\n(ROUGE, BERTScore, BLEURT) and LLM-as-judge assessments across multiple\nclinical quality dimensions. Results: The fine-tuned OnDevice model\ndemonstrated substantial improvements over the base model. On the ACI\nbenchmark, ROUGE-1 scores increased from 0.346 to 0.496, while BERTScore F1\nimproved from 0.832 to 0.866. Clinical quality assessments showed marked\nreduction in major hallucinations (from 85 to 35 cases) and enhanced factual\ncorrectness (2.81 to 3.54 on 5-point scale).

Nevertheless, such approach leads to inferior performance in various\nNLP tasks when the model is not certain about testing questions. To this end,\nwe propose a brand new training-free decoding strategy, dubbed as Cautious Next\nToken Prediction (CNTP). In the decoding process, if the model has\ncomparatively high prediction entropy at a certain step, we sample multiple\ntrials starting from the step independently and stop when encountering any\npunctuation. Then we select the trial with the lowest perplexity score viewed\nas the most probable and reliable trial path given the model's capacity. The\ntrial number is negatively correlated with the prediction confidence, i.e., the\nless confident the model is, the more trials it should sample. This is\nconsistent with human beings' behaviour: when feeling uncertain or unconfident,\none tends to think more creatively, exploring multiple thinking paths, to\ncautiously select the path one feels most confident about. Extensive\nexperiments on both LLMs and MLLMs show that our proposed CNTP approach\noutperforms existing standard decoding strategies consistently by a clear\nmargin.

Currently, such evaluation relies solely on manual physician\nreview. However, detecting errors in LM-generated text is challenging because\n1) manual review is costly and 2) expert-composed reference outputs are often\nunavailable in real-world settings. While the \"LM-as-judge\" paradigm (a LM\nevaluating another LM) offers scalable evaluation, even frontier LMs can miss\nsubtle but clinically significant errors. To address these challenges, we\npropose MedVAL, a self-supervised framework that leverages synthetic data to\ntrain evaluator LMs to assess whether LM-generated medical outputs are\nfactually consistent with inputs, without requiring physician labels or\nreference outputs. To evaluate LM performance, we introduce MedVAL-Bench, a\ndataset containing 840 outputs annotated by physicians, following a\nphysician-defined taxonomy of risk levels and error categories. Across 6\ndiverse medical tasks and 10 state-of-the-art LMs spanning open-source,\nproprietary, and medically adapted models, MedVAL fine-tuning significantly\nimproves (p < 0.001) alignment with physicians on both seen and unseen tasks,\nincreasing average F1 scores from 66% to 83%, with per-sample safety\nclassification scores up to 86%. MedVAL improves the performance of even the\nbest-performing proprietary LM (GPT-4o) by 8%.

As a result, considerable time\ninvestments and specialist knowledge is often needed to extract actionable\ninsights related to R/S from general archival sources, increasing reliance on\npublished literature and manual desk reviews. To address this challenge, we\npresent SpiritRAG, an interactive Question Answering (Q&A) system based on\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Built using 7,500 United Nations (UN)\nresolution documents related to R/S in the domains of health and education,\nSpiritRAG allows researchers and policymakers to conduct complex,\ncontext-sensitive database searches of very large datasets using an easily\naccessible, chat-based web interface.

However, these approaches pay\nless attention to the spatial continuity and inter-slice correlations in the\nvolumetric CT data, leading to fragmented and imprecise responses. In this\npaper, we propose a novel large language model (LLM)-based framework enhanced\nby a graph representation of salient features. Different from conventional\nmultimodal encoding strategies, our approach constructs a cross-modal graph\nintegrating both visual and textual features, treating individual CT slices and\nquestion tokens as nodes within the graph. We further leverage an attentive\ngraph convolutional network to dynamically fuse information within this\nstructure. The resulting aggregated graph features then serve as a soft prompt\nto guide a large language model in generating accurate answers.

However, we observe that such global length penalty\noften lead to excessive compression of critical reasoning steps while\npreserving unnecessary details in simpler ones, yielding a suboptimal trade-off\nbetween accuracy and efficiency. To address this issue, we propose\nSmartThinker, a two-stage learnable framework designed to enable fine-grained\ncontrol over the length of reasoning chains based on the importance of each\nindividual step. In the first stage, SmartThinker adapts a reasoning model to a\nshort-form reasoning mode through rejection sampling combined with supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, SmartThinker applies Step-Level Length\nControl Policy Optimization (SCPO) to refine the model output distribution,\nwhich increases the proportion of length allocated to critical steps while\nreducing redundancy in less important ones.

A\nprime exemplification is the development of Video Large Language Models\n(Video-LLMs). While numerous advancements have been proposed to enhance the\nvideo understanding capabilities of these models, they are predominantly\ntrained on questions generated directly from video content. However, in\nreal-world scenarios, users often pose questions that extend beyond the\ninformational scope of the video, highlighting the need for Video-LLMs to\nassess the relevance of the question. We demonstrate that even the\nbest-performing Video-LLMs fail to reject unfit questions-not necessarily due\nto a lack of video understanding, but because they have not been trained to\nidentify and refuse such questions. To address this limitation, we propose\nalignment for answerability, a framework that equips Video-LLMs with the\nability to evaluate the relevance of a question based on the input video and\nappropriately decline to answer when the question exceeds the scope of the\nvideo, as well as an evaluation framework with a comprehensive set of metrics\ndesigned to measure model behavior before and after alignment. Furthermore, we\npresent a pipeline for creating a dataset specifically tailored for alignment\nfor answerability, leveraging existing video-description paired datasets."}

Accordingly,\nautonomous vehicles (AuVs) are defined as systems capable of perceiving their\nenvironment and executing preprogrammed tasks independently of external input.\nHowever, both research and real-world deployments increasingly showcase\nvehicles that demonstrate behaviors beyond this definition (including the SAE\nlevels 1 to 6), such as interaction with humans and machines, goal adaptation,\ncontextual reasoning, external tool use, and long-term planning, particularly\nwith the integration of large language models (LLMs) and agentic AI systems.\nThese developments reveal a conceptual gap between technical autonomy and the\nbroader cognitive and social capabilities needed for future human-centered\nmobility systems. To address this, we introduce the concept of agentic vehicles\n(AgVs), referring to vehicles that integrate agentic AI to reason, adapt, and\ninteract within complex environments. This paper presents a systems-level\nframework to characterize AgVs, focusing on their cognitive and communicative\nlayers and differentiating them from conventional AuVs. It synthesizes relevant\nadvances in agentic AI, robotics, multi-agent systems, and human-machine\ninteraction, and highlights how agentic AI, through high-level reasoning and\ntool use, can function not merely as computational tools but as interactive\nagents embedded in mobility ecosystems.

This system is known to be of high complexity, and\ndrowns out finer aspects of the combination of logic and counting. We move to a\nsmall fragment that can represent numerical syllogisms and basic reasoning\nabout comparative size: monadic first-order logic with counting. We provide\nnormal forms that allow for axiomatization, determine which arithmetical\nnotions can be defined on finite and on infinite models, and conversely, we\ndiscuss which logical notions can be defined out of purely arithmetical ones,\nand what sort of (non-)classical logics can be induced.\n  Next, we investigate a series of strengthenings, again using normal form\nmethods. The monadic second-order version is close, in a precise sense, to\nadditive Presburger Arithmetic, while versions with the natural device of tuple\ncounting take us to Diophantine equations, making the logic undecidable.
