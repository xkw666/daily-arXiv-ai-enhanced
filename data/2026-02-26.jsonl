An application of the filter is presented in the context of human animation replay for real-time simulations, where switches in animation clips cause discontinuities that must be hidden by filtering the bone trajectory without introducing noticeable artifacts. The quality of the filtering will be compared with other common animation filtering techniques using an example case drawn fromthe LaFAN1 dataset, showing that the resulting animation is replayed with higher fidelity by evaluating the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Normalized Power Spectrum Similarity (NPSS) for each setup. Performances will be evaluated using both a standard predetermined triggerpoint and blending distance and the automatic blending trigger and recovery system."}

However, enabling VLMs to effectively comprehend structured graphs and perform accurate, efficient QA remains challenging. Existing approaches typically rely on one single graph topology representation (GTR), such as fixed-style visual images or unified text descriptions. This ``one-size-fits-all'' strategy often neglects model-specific and task-specific preferences, resulting in inaccurate or over-lengthy responses to graph-related queries. To address this, we propose the $\\mbox{DynamicGTR}$ framework, which dynamically selects the optimal GTR for each query during inference, thereby enhancing the zero-shot graph QA capabilities of VLMs with a customizable accuracy and brevity trade-off. Extensive experiments show that DynamicGTR not only improves VLM-based graph algorithm QA performance but also successfully transfers the experience trained from synthetic graph algorithm tasks to real-world applications like link prediction and node classification, without any additional training. Additionally, DynamicGTR demonstrates strong transferability across tasks, domains, and models, suggesting its potential as a flexible solution for broad graph scenarios."}

While effective, existing methods rely on dense intervention at every decoding step. This persistent manipulation not only incurs substantial computational overhead but also risks compromising generation quality by excessively drifting from the model's intrinsic distribution. In this work, we show that dense intervention is unnecessary and propose Sparse Inference time Alignment (SIA), which performs sparse junction steering by intervening only at critical decision points along the generation trajectory. Our key insight is that high entropy junctions mark pivotal decision points in the generation trajectory and are particularly susceptible to misalignment, indicating the need to introduce alignment related reward signals at these points. Extensive experiments across different model families and alignment objectives show that steering only 20% to 80% of tokens achieves superior alignment-efficiency trade offs. For strong base models such as Qwen3, intervening on as few as 20% of tokens matches or even surpasses heavily post-trained instruct models. This sparsity enables stronger guidance while better preserving the model's native distribution, integrates seamlessly with search based methods such as Best-of-N, and reduces computational cost by up to 6x."}

In this study, we investigate fine-tuning of general-purpose (BERT) and domain-specific (SciBERT, BioBERT) pre-trained language models (PLMs), enriched with biomedical entity information extracted through scispaCy models for each statement, to improve EQ-5D detection from abstracts. We conduct nine experimental setups, including combining three scispaCy models with three PLMs, and evaluate their performance at both the sentence and study levels. Furthermore, we explore a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approach with attention pooling to aggregate sentence-level information into study-level predictions, where each abstract is represented as a bag of enriched sentences (by scispaCy). The findings indicate consistent improvements in F1-scores (reaching 0.82) and nearly perfect recall at the study-level, significantly exceeding classical bag-of-words baselines and recently reported PLM baselines. These results show that entity enrichment significantly improves domain adaptation and model generalization, enabling more accurate automated screening in systematic reviews."}

We introduce EPSVec, a differentially-private lightweight alternative that steers LLM generation using *dataset vectors*--directions in activation space that capture the distributional gap between private data and public priors. EPSVec extracts and sanitizes steering vectors just once and then performs standard decoding. This decouples the privacy budget from generation, enabling arbitrarily many synthetic samples without additional privacy cost and yielding strong fidelity even in low-data regimes.

To address this challenge, we introduce GraSPer (Graph-based Sparse Personalized Reasoning), a novel framework for enhancing personalized text generation under sparse context. GraSPer first augments user context by predicting items that the user would likely interact with in the future. With reasoning alignment, it then generates texts for these interactions to enrich the augmented context. In the end, it generates personalized outputs conditioned on both the real and synthetic histories, ensuring alignment with user style and preferences. Extensive experiments on three benchmark personalized generation datasets show that GraSPer achieves significant performance gain, substantially improving personalization in sparse user context settings."}

Our approach constructs a task-aware vector database by embedding training examples from 22 datasets spanning commonsense reasoning, question answering, natural language inference, and sentiment analysis. At inference time, we retrieve the most similar training examples, compute task similarity distributions via nucleus sampling, and dynamically merge relevant LoRA adapters using retrieval weighted fusion strategies.

We study this effect as pragmatic framing, contextual cues that shape directive interpretation rather than task specification. While prior work exploits such cues for prompt optimization or probes them as security vulnerabilities, pragmatic framing itself has not been treated as a measurable property of instruction following. Measuring this influence systematically remains challenging, requiring controlled isolation of framing cues. We introduce a framework with three novel components: directive-framing decomposition separating framing context from task specification; a taxonomy organizing 400 instantiations of framing into 13 strategies across 4 mechanism clusters; and priority-based measurement that quantifies influence through observable shifts in directive prioritization. Across five LLMs of different families and sizes, influence mechanisms cause consistent and structured shifts in directive prioritization, moving models from baseline impartiality toward favoring the framed directive. This work establishes pragmatic framing as a measurable and predictable factor in instruction-following systems."}

However, while this paradigm successfully increases the arithmetic intensity of memory-bound inference, it causes significant compute inefficiency: the majority of draft tokens fail verification and are discarded, resulting in waste of computation. Motivated by the goal of recollecting this wasted computation, we propose a novel system that transforms discarded drafts into reusable tokens. Our key insight is to perform auto-regressive prediction at the hidden states level and postpone the integrating token information after the hidden states generation, so the draft hidden states are not contaminated by incorrect tokens, enabling hidden state reuse. To implement such a system, first we introduce a draft model architecture based on auto-regressive hidden states, which preserves richer semantics than token-based drafters to facilitate draft repurposing. Second, we design an efficient token information injection mechanism that leverages our specialized draft model to construct high-quality draft token trees and enables resampling tokens from verification failures. Third, we eliminate the overhead hidden in our design to further maximize hardware utilization. We conducted extensive evaluations against various baselines, demonstrating up to a 3.3x speedup against standard speculative decoding."}

By evaluating BERT (text-only, 110M parameters) and LayoutLMv3 (multimodal, 126M parameters) on the FUNSD and CORD benchmarks, we establish that this schedule reduces wall-clock training time by approximately 33\\%, commensurate with the reduction from 6.67 to 10.0 effective epoch-equivalents of data. To isolate curriculum effects from compute reduction, we introduce matched-compute baselines (Standard-7) that control for total gradient updates. On the FUNSD dataset, the curriculum significantly outperforms the matched-compute baseline for BERT ($Δ$F1 = +0.023, $p=0.022$, $d_z=3.83$), constituting evidence for a genuine scheduling benefit in capacity-constrained models. In contrast, no analogous benefit is observed for LayoutLMv3 ($p=0.621$), whose multimodal representations provide sufficient inductive bias. On the CORD dataset, all conditions converge to equivalent F1 scores ($\\geq$0.947) irrespective of scheduling, indicating a performance ceiling. Schedule ablations comparing progressive, two-phase, reverse, and random pacing confirm that the efficiency gain derives from reduced data volume rather than ordering.

While model routing is effective for single-turn queries, agentic routing is a sequential, path-dependent problem: early mistakes compound, feedback is often at the end of the episode, and deployments often demand strict per-task spending limits. We propose Budget-Aware Agentic Routing, which selects between a cheap and an expensive model at each step to optimize the cost--success frontier and to operate under strict per-task budgets. We propose Boundary-Guided Training, which leverages two boundary policies (always-small vs.\\ always-large) to build a difficulty taxonomy and to anchor learning under sparse rewards. Our approach warms start with boundary-guided SFT data synthesis via stratified sampling of cost-efficient trajectories, then applies Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization (BoPO), combining boundary-relative rewards with a reference-guided advantage to avoid degenerate cheap-failure solutions. Experiment results show that our method improves the efficiency frontier, matching strong routing baselines at substantially lower cost while demonstrating generalization to strict inference-time budget constraints. Overall, our work establishes a foundational framework for agentic routing, shifting the paradigm from static model selection to dynamic, budget-aware sequential decision-making."}

We propose ImpRIF, a method to enhance LLMs' understanding of implicit reasoning instructions, thereby improving its ability to follow complex instructions. We formalize such instructions as verifiable reasoning graphs, enabling programmatic verification and graph-driven chain-of-thought reasoning. Based on this formulation, we synthesize large-scale single- and multi-turn data, propose fine-tuning with graph reasoning, and apply reinforcement learning to explicitly train models to reason along the graph. On five complex instruction following benchmarks, our models substantially outperform their base models.

To address these gaps, we introduce TRACE (Trajectory-Aware Comprehensive Evaluation), a framework that holistically assesses the entire problem-solving trajectory. To counter the \"high-score illusion\", we propose a Hierarchical Trajectory Utility Function that quantifies process efficiency and cognitive quality, including evidence grounding, alongside accuracy. To measure deeper attributes, TRACE introduces a Scaffolded Capability Assessment protocol, quantifying an agent's latent ability by determining the minimum guidance needed for success.

To be useful advisors, LLMs must sift through large amounts of content, written with both benevolent and malicious intent, and then use this information to convince a user to take a specific action. This involves two social capacities: vigilance (the ability to determine which information to use, and which to discard) and persuasion (synthesizing the available evidence to make a convincing argument). While existing work has investigated these capacities in isolation, there has been little prior investigation of how these capacities may be linked. Here, we use a simple multi-turn puzzle-solving game, Sokoban, to study LLMs' abilities to persuade and be rationally vigilant towards other LLM agents. We find that puzzle-solving performance, persuasive capability, and vigilance are dissociable capacities in LLMs. Performing well on the game does not automatically mean a model can detect when it is being misled, even if the possibility of deception is explicitly mentioned. % as part of the prompt. However, LLMs do consistently modulate their token use, using fewer tokens to reason when advice is benevolent and more when it is malicious, even if they are still persuaded to take actions leading them to failure. To our knowledge, our work presents the first investigation of the relationship between persuasion, vigilance, and task performance in LLMs, and suggests that monitoring all three independently will be critical for future work in AI safety."}

It turns math problems into a controlled, correctness-checkable benchmark with tool sets, enabling systematic evaluation of model reliability under (1) large, overlapping tool catalogs and (2) the absence of the intended capability. \\ToolMATH provides actionable diagnostic evidence of failure modes in tool-augmented agents, helping identify the control mechanisms required for robustness. \\ToolMATH roughly contains 8k questions and 12k tools; we provide an additional hard-set \\ToolMATHHard with questions and tools. Our evaluation reveals that the key failure factor is due to the inability to reason, leading to the accumulation of intermediate results' errors and constrain later decisions. Tool-list redundancy do not simply add noise, but amplify small early deviations into irreversible execution drift. The benchmark highlights that when the intended capability is missing, distractor tools can sometimes serve as partial substitutes in solution paths, yet they can also mislead models into ungrounded tool trajectories. Finally, comparisons between tool-use protocols emphasize that improvements come less from local action selection and more from long-range plan coherence and disciplined use of observations."}

However, these LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that disguise harmful intent through indirect or deceptive phrasing. Using causal intervention, we empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from shallow alignment mechanisms that lack deep reasoning, often rejecting harmful prompts without truly understanding why they are harmful. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose enhancing alignment through reasoning-aware post-training. We construct and release a novel Chain-of-Thought (CoT) fine-tuning dataset that includes both utility-oriented and safety-critical prompts with step-by-step rationales. Fine-tuning on this dataset encourages models to produce principled refusals grounded in reasoning, outperforming standard SFT baselines. Furthermore, inspired by failure patterns in CoT fine-tuning, we introduce Alignment-Weighted DPO, which targets the most problematic parts of an output by assigning different preference weights to the reasoning and final-answer segments. This produces finer-grained, targeted updates than vanilla DPO and improves robustness to diverse jailbreak strategies. Extensive experiments across multiple safety and utility benchmarks show that our method consistently improves alignment robustness while maintaining overall model utility."}

To mitigate this problem, we propose to computes word vectors directly from character strings, integrating both semantic and syntactic information. We denote this transformer-based approach Rich Character Embeddings (RCE). Furthermore, we propose a hybrid model that combines transformer and convolutional mechanisms.

We introduce VecGlypher, a single multimodal language model that generates high-fidelity vector glyphs directly from text descriptions or image exemplars. Given a style prompt, optional reference glyph images, and a target character, VecGlypher autoregressively emits SVG path tokens, avoiding raster intermediates and producing editable, watertight outlines in one pass. A typography-aware data and training recipe makes this possible: (i) a large-scale continuation stage on 39K noisy Envato fonts to master SVG syntax and long-horizon geometry, followed by (ii) post-training on 2.5K expert-annotated Google Fonts with descriptive tags and exemplars to align language and imagery with geometry; preprocessing normalizes coordinate frames, canonicalizes paths, de-duplicates families, and quantizes coordinates for stable long-sequence decoding. On cross-family OOD evaluation, VecGlypher substantially outperforms both general-purpose LLMs and specialized vector-font baselines for text-only generation, while image-referenced generation reaches a state-of-the-art performance, with marked gains over DeepVecFont-v2 and DualVector. Ablations show that model scale and the two-stage recipe are critical and that absolute-coordinate serialization yields the best geometry. VecGlypher lowers the barrier to font creation by letting users design with words or exemplars, and provides a scalable foundation for future multimodal design tools."}

We first analyzed interviews from the Corpus of Regional African American Language and TwitterAAE to identify the typical contexts where people use AAVE grammatical features such as ain't. We then prompted the LLMs to produce text in AAVE and compared the model-generated text to human usage patterns. We find that, in many cases, there are substantial differences between AAVE usage in LLMs and humans: LLMs usually underuse and misuse grammatical features characteristic of AAVE. Furthermore, through sentiment analysis and manual inspection, we found that the models replicated stereotypes about African Americans. These results highlight the need for more diversity in training data and the incorporation of fairness methods to mitigate the perpetuation of stereotypes."}

To address this gap, we introduce MixSarc, the first publicly available Bangla-English code-mixed corpus for implicit meaning identification. The dataset contains 9,087 manually annotated sentences labeled for humor, sarcasm, offensiveness, and vulgarity. We construct the corpus through targeted social media collection, systematic filtering, and multi-annotator validation. We benchmark transformer-based models and evaluate zero-shot large language models under structured prompting. Results show strong performance on humor detection but substantial degradation on sarcasm, offense, and vulgarity due to class imbalance and pragmatic complexity. Zero-shot models achieve competitive micro-F1 scores but low exact match accuracy. Further analysis reveals that over 42\\% of negative sentiment instances in an external dataset exhibit sarcastic characteristics. MixSarc provides a foundational resource for culturally aware NLP and supports more reliable multi-label modeling in code-mixed environments."}

A common strategy is to inject additional information at inference time, such as explicit spatial cues, external commonsense knowledge, or chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning instructions. However, it remains unclear when such information genuinely improves reasoning and when it introduces noise. In this paper, we conduct a hypothesis-driven analysis of information injection for VSR across three representative VLMs and two public benchmarks. We examine (i) the type and number of spatial contexts, (ii) the amount and relevance of injected commonsense knowledge, and (iii) the interaction between spatial grounding and CoT prompting. Our results reveal a consistent pattern: more information does not necessarily yield better reasoning. Targeted single spatial cues outperform multi-context aggregation, excessive or weakly relevant commonsense knowledge degrades performance, and CoT prompting improves accuracy only when spatial grounding is sufficiently precise. These findings highlight the importance of selective, task-aligned information injection and provide practical guidance for designing reliable multimodal reasoning pipelines."}

In this paper, we propose Stratified Rubric-based Curriculum Learning (RuCL), a novel framework that reformulates curriculum learning by shifting the focus from data selection to reward design. RuCL generates generalized rubrics for broad applicability and stratifies them based on the model's competence.

Although current NLP research has examined overall counseling quality and general therapeutic skills, it fails to provide granular evaluations of high-stakes moments where clients exhibit resistance. In this work, we present a comprehensive pipeline for the multi-dimensional evaluation of human counselors' interventions specifically targeting client resistance in text-based therapy. We introduce a theory-driven framework that decomposes counselor responses into four distinct communication mechanisms. Leveraging this framework, we curate and share an expert-annotated dataset of real-world counseling excerpts, pairing counselor-client interactions with professional ratings and explanatory rationales. Using this data, we perform full-parameter instruction tuning on a Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct backbone to model fine-grained evaluative judgments of response quality and generate explanations underlying. Experimental results show that our approach can effectively distinguish the quality of different communication mechanisms (77-81% F1), substantially outperforming GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet (45-59% F1). Moreover, the model produces high-quality explanations that closely align with expert references and receive near-ceiling ratings from human experts (2.8-2.9/3.0). A controlled experiment with 43 counselors further confirms that receiving these AI-generated feedback significantly improves counselors' ability to respond effectively to client resistance."}

In this paper, we propose a Speech-guided Machine Translation (SMT) framework that integrates speech and text as fused inputs into an MLLM to improve translation quality. To mitigate reliance on low-resource data, we introduce a Self-Evolution Mechanism. The core components of this framework include a text-to-speech model, responsible for generating synthetic speech, and an MLLM capable of classifying synthetic speech samples and iteratively optimizing itself using positive samples. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework surpasses all existing methods on the Multi30K multimodal machine translation benchmark, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, on general machine translation datasets, particularly the FLORES-200, it achieves average state-of-the-art performance in 108 translation directions.

We empirically investigate the influence of punctuation loss, demonstrating that unpunctuated ASR output significantly degrades translation quality, causing a massive 20.7% relative BLEU drop on the FLORES benchmark. To overcome this, we propose and evaluate an intermediate Punctuation Restoration Module (PRM). The final S2TT pipeline was tested across three configurations on a custom dataset. The optimal configuration, which applied the PRM directly to ASR output, achieved a 4.90 BLEU point gain over the direct ASR-to-NMT baseline (BLEU 36.38 vs. 31.48).

We propose Sparsity Induction, which promotes models toward higher sparsity at both distribution and feature levels before pruning, to push the limits of PTS.

At the token level, DWA-KD maps teacher representations into the student space and vice versa, performing dual-space KD via Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL). The process is modulated by dual-space weights that up-weight tokens where the student is uncertain and the teacher is confident, thereby focusing learning on informative tokens rather than treating all positions equally. At the sequence level, DWA-KD applies Soft Dynamic Time Warping (Soft-DTW) to both the embedding and final hidden-state layers, enabling robust alignment of lexical and contextual semantics between teacher and student sequences.

Following prior work that relates cross-linguistic tendencies to biases in learning, we ask whether regular systems are common because regularity facilitates learning. Adopting methods from the Reinforcement Learning literature, we confirm that highly regular human(-like) systems are easier to learn than unattested but possible irregular systems. This asymmetry emerges under the natural assumption that recursive numeral systems are designed for generalisation from limited data to represent all integers exactly. We also find that the influence of regularity on learnability is absent for unnatural, highly irregular systems, whose learnability is influenced instead by signal length, suggesting that different pressures may influence learnability differently in different parts of the space of possible numeral systems. Our results contribute to the body of work linking learnability to cross-linguistic prevalence."}

However, they naturally confined the reasoning patterns of LLMs within the scope of prior experience or fine-tuning data, limiting their generalizability to out-of-distribution graph reasoning problems. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose Explore-on-Graph (EoG), a novel framework that encourages LLMs to autonomously explore a more diverse reasoning space on KGs. To incentivize exploration and discovery of novel reasoning paths, we propose to introduce reinforcement learning during training, whose reward is the correctness of the reasoning paths' final answers. To enhance the efficiency and meaningfulness of the exploration, we propose to incorporate path information as additional reward signals to refine the exploration process and reduce futile efforts.

A further limitation is that existing methods only predict relations without providing any supporting explanations. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities in both deep language understanding and natural language explanation generation. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective approach to distill the reasoning capabilities of LLMs into lightweight IDRR models to improve both performance and interpretability. Specifically, we first prompt an LLM to generate explanations for each training instance conditioned on its gold label. Then, we introduce a novel classification-generation framework that jointly performs relation prediction and explanation generation, and train it with the additional supervision of LLM-generated explanations. Our framework is plug-and-play, enabling easy integration with most existing IDRR models. Experimental results on PDTB demonstrate that our approach significantly improves IDRR performance, while human evaluation further confirms that the generated explanations enhance model interpretability. Furthermore, we validate the generality of our approach on sentiment classification and natural language inference"}

This evaluation paradigm, on the one hand, entangles semantic assessment with modality generation, leading to ambiguous error attribution, and on the other hand remains constrained by the heavy reliance on human judgment. To this end, we propose MERRY, a semantically decoupled evaluation framework for assessing Multimodal Emotional and Role consistencies of Role-playing agents.

Our empirical results primarily reveal that: (1) Training on synthetic datasets tends to reduce emotional consistency, whereas training on real-world datasets improves it; (2) Existing models suffer from emotional templatization and simplification, exhibiting positive-bias and performance bottleneck in fine-grained negative emotions; (3) Simple prompting method strengthens the weak models but constrains the strong ones, while simple fine-tuning method suffers from poor role generalization.

Part of our architecture is a modular pipeline for continuous personality scoring that evaluates dialogues along latent axes while remaining agnostic to the specific personality models, their dimensions, transition mechanisms, or LLMs used. These scores function as dynamic state variables that systematically reconfigure the system prompt, steering behavioral alignment throughout the interaction.We evaluate this framework by operationalizing the Interpersonal Circumplex (IPC) in a medical education setting.

Although recent models support increasingly long context windows, their accuracy often deteriorates as input length grows.

DySCO leverages retrieval heads--a subset of attention heads specialized for long-context retrieval--to identify task-relevant tokens at each decoding step and explicitly up-weight them. By doing so, DySCO dynamically adjusts attention during generation to better utilize relevant context. The method is training-free and can be applied directly to any off-the-shelf LMs. Across multiple instruction-tuned and reasoning models, DySCO consistently improves performance on challenging long-context reasoning benchmarks, yielding relative gains of up to 25% on MRCR and LongBenchV2 at 128K context length with modest additional compute.

Rumors can continuously emerge across diverse domains and topics, often with the intent to mislead society for personal or commercial gain. Therefore, developing methods that can accurately detect rumors at early stages is crucial to mitigating their negative impact. While existing approaches often specialize in single-domain detection, their performance degrades when applied to new domains due to shifts in data distribution, such as lexical patterns and propagation dynamics. To bridge this gap, this study introduces PerFact, a large-scale multi-domain rumor dataset comprising 8,034 annotated posts from the X platform, annotated into two primary categories: rumor (including true, false, and unverified rumors) and non-rumor. Annotator agreement, measured via Fleiss' Kappa ($κ= 0.74$), ensures high-quality labels.\n  This research further proposes an effective multi-domain rumor detection model that employs a domain gate to dynamically aggregate multiple feature representations extracted through a Mixture-of-Experts method.

By utilizing a disposable LoRA module as a compiler, we distill long contexts into compact buffer tokens -- stateless, portable memory artifacts that are plug-and-play compatible with frozen base models. Crucially, we introduce a self-aligned optimization strategy that eliminates the need for synthetic context-relevant QA pairs. By regularizing context reconstruction task with context-agnostic random queries, we force compressed tokens to reside within the model's existing instruction-following manifold.

Results show that sigma-based routing achieves 55.6 percent accuracy, exceeding the two-model baseline of 54.4 percent while avoiding full ensembling on 54.2 percent of tasks. The routing mechanism is model-agnostic and requires no learned components. We also document negative results. First, retrieval augmentation reduced accuracy by 3.4 percentage points, as median retrieval similarity was only 0.167, demonstrating that experience injection without semantic alignment introduces noise rather than grounding. Second, when models agree on incorrect answers (sigma equals zero), no downstream ensemble can recover; this agreement-but-wrong failure mode is intrinsic to self-consistency and bounds achievable accuracy at approximately eight percentage points below full ensembling. Third, attribution estimates based on proxy signals such as response similarity and entropy showed weak correlation with ground-truth leave-one-out values, indicating that practical attribution requires explicit counterfactual computation.

Despite search's essential role in deep research, black-box web search APIs hinder systematic analysis of search components, leaving the behaviour of established text ranking methods in deep research largely unclear. To fill this gap, we reproduce a selection of key findings and best practices for IR text ranking methods in the deep research setting. In particular, we examine their effectiveness from three perspectives: (i) retrieval units (documents vs. passages), (ii) pipeline configurations (different retrievers, re-rankers, and re-ranking depths), and (iii) query characteristics (the mismatch between agent-issued queries and the training queries of text rankers). We perform experiments on BrowseComp-Plus, a deep research dataset with a fixed corpus, evaluating 2 open-source agents, 5 retrievers, and 3 re-rankers across diverse setups. We find that agent-issued queries typically follow web-search-style syntax (e.g., quoted exact matches), favouring lexical, learned sparse, and multi-vector retrievers; passage-level units are more efficient under limited context windows, and avoid the difficulties of document length normalisation in lexical retrieval; re-ranking is highly effective; translating agent-issued queries into natural-language questions significantly bridges the query mismatch."}

As a result, prior work often relies on manual curation or simple heuristic filters (e.g., accuracy), which can admit incorrect or low-utility problems. We propose GradAlign, a gradient-aligned data selection method for LLM reinforcement learning that uses a small, trusted validation set to prioritize training problems whose policy gradients align with validation gradients, yielding an adaptive curriculum.

However, despite their shared neural origins, extreme discrepancies have traditionally confined these modalities to isolated analysis pipelines, hindering a holistic interpretation of brain activity. To bridge this fragmentation, we introduce \\textbf{NOBEL}, a \\textbf{n}euro-\\textbf{o}mni-modal \\textbf{b}rain-\\textbf{e}ncoding \\textbf{l}arge language model (LLM) that unifies these heterogeneous signals within the LLM's semantic embedding space. Our architecture integrates a unified encoder for EEG and MEG with a novel dual-path strategy for fMRI, aligning non-invasive brain signals and external sensory stimuli into a shared token space, then leverages an LLM as a universal backbone. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that NOBEL serves as a robust generalist across standard single-modal tasks. We also show that the synergistic fusion of electromagnetic and metabolic signals yields higher decoding accuracy than unimodal baselines, validating the complementary nature of multiple neural modalities. Furthermore, NOBEL exhibits strong capabilities in stimulus-aware decoding, effectively interpreting visual semantics from multi-subject fMRI data on the NSD and HAD datasets while uniquely leveraging direct stimulus inputs to verify causal links between sensory signals and neural responses. NOBEL thus takes a step towards unifying non-invasive brain decoding, demonstrating the promising potential of omni-modal brain understanding."}

We present a variable isolation study (n=20 per condition, 6 conditions, 120 total trials) examining which prompt architecture layers in a production system enable correct reasoning. Using Claude 3.5 Sonnet with controlled hyperparameters (temperature 0.7, top_p 1.0), we find that the STAR (Situation-Task-Action-Result) reasoning framework alone raises accuracy from 0% to 85% (p=0.001, Fisher's exact test, odds ratio 13.22). Adding user profile context via vector database retrieval provides a further 10 percentage point gain, while RAG context contributes an additional 5 percentage points, achieving 100% accuracy in the full-stack condition. These results suggest that structured reasoning scaffolds -- specifically, forced goal articulation before inference -- matter substantially more than context injection for implicit constraint reasoning tasks."}

However, enabling VLMs to effectively comprehend structured graphs and perform accurate, efficient QA remains challenging. Existing approaches typically rely on one single graph topology representation (GTR), such as fixed-style visual images or unified text descriptions. This ``one-size-fits-all'' strategy often neglects model-specific and task-specific preferences, resulting in inaccurate or over-lengthy responses to graph-related queries. To address this, we propose the $\\mbox{DynamicGTR}$ framework, which dynamically selects the optimal GTR for each query during inference, thereby enhancing the zero-shot graph QA capabilities of VLMs with a customizable accuracy and brevity trade-off. Extensive experiments show that DynamicGTR not only improves VLM-based graph algorithm QA performance but also successfully transfers the experience trained from synthetic graph algorithm tasks to real-world applications like link prediction and node classification, without any additional training. Additionally, DynamicGTR demonstrates strong transferability across tasks, domains, and models, suggesting its potential as a flexible solution for broad graph scenarios."}

While a wealth of spoken content is accessible in television dramas and online videos, Taiwanese Hokkien exemplifies this issue, with transcriptions often being scarce and the majority of available subtitles provided only in Mandarin. To address this deficiency, we introduce TG-ASR for Taiwanese Hokkien drama speech recognition, a translation-guided ASR framework that utilizes multilingual translation embeddings to enhance recognition performance in low-resource environments. The framework is centered around the parallel gated cross-attention (PGCA) mechanism, which adaptively integrates embeddings from various auxiliary languages into the ASR decoder. This mechanism facilitates robust cross-linguistic semantic guidance while ensuring stable optimization and minimizing interference between languages. To support ongoing research initiatives, we present YT-THDC, a 30-hour corpus of Taiwanese Hokkien drama speech with aligned Mandarin subtitles and manually verified Taiwanese Hokkien transcriptions. Comprehensive experiments and analyses identify the auxiliary languages that most effectively enhance ASR performance, achieving a 14.77% relative reduction in character error rate and demonstrating the efficacy of translation-guided learning for underrepresented languages in practical applications."}

In SWE-Protégé, an SLM remains the sole decision-maker while learning to selectively seek guidance from a strong expert model, recognize stalled states, and follow through on expert feedback. Our approach combines supervised fine-tuning on expert-augmented trajectories with agentic reinforcement learning that explicitly discourages degenerative looping and unproductive expert collaboration. We lightly post-train Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct to achieve 42.4% Pass@1 on SWE-bench Verified, a +25.4% improvement over the prior SLM state of the art, while using expert assistance sparsely (~4 calls per task and 11% of total tokens)."}

A natural question arises from this phenomenon: Which component of the LVLM pipeline primarily contributes to object hallucinations? The vision encoder to perceive visual information, or the language decoder to generate text responses? In this work, we strive to answer this question through designing a systematic experiment to analyze the roles of the vision encoder and the language decoder in hallucination generation. Our observations reveal that object hallucinations are predominantly associated with the strong priors from the language decoder. Based on this finding, we propose a simple and training-free framework, No-Language-Hallucination Decoding, NoLan, which refines the output distribution by dynamically suppressing language priors, modulated based on the output distribution difference between multimodal and text-only inputs. Experimental results demonstrate that NoLan effectively reduces object hallucinations across various LVLMs on different tasks. For instance, NoLan achieves substantial improvements on POPE, enhancing the accuracy of LLaVA-1.5 7B and Qwen-VL 7B by up to 6.45 and 7.21, respectively.

We introduce \"Cultural Ghosting\", the systematic erasure of linguistic markers unique to non-native English varieties during text processing. Through analysis of 22,350 LLM outputs generated from 1,490 culturally marked texts (Indian, Singaporean,& Nigerian English) processed by five models under three prompt conditions, we quantify this phenomenon using two novel metrics: Identity Erasure Rate (IER) & Semantic Preservation Score (SPS). Across all prompts, we find an overall IER of 10.26%, with model-level variation from 3.5% to 20.5% (5.9x range). Crucially, we identify a Semantic Preservation Paradox: models maintain high semantic similarity (mean SPS = 0.748) while systematically erasing cultural markers. Pragmatic markers (politeness conventions) are 1.9x more vulnerable than lexical markers (71.5% vs. 37.1% erasure). Our experiments demonstrate that explicit cultural-preservation prompts reduce erasure by 29% without sacrificing semantic quality."}

This gap stems from two limitations: a shortage of high-quality, action-aligned reasoning data, and the direct adoption of generic post-training pipelines that overlook the unique challenges of GUI agents. We identify two fundamental issues in these pipelines: (i) standard SFT with CoT reasoning often hurts grounding, and (ii) step-wise RLVR-tyle training faces partial verifiability, where multiple actions can be correct but only a single demonstrated action is used for verification. This makes offline step-wise metrics weak predictors of online task success. In this work, we present GUI-Libra, a tailored training recipe that addresses these challenges. First, to mitigate the scarcity of action-aligned reasoning data, we introduce a data construction and filtering pipeline and release a curated 81K GUI reasoning dataset. Second, to reconcile reasoning with grounding, we propose action-aware SFT that mixes reasoning-then-action and direct-action data and reweights tokens to emphasize action and grounding. Third, to stabilize RL under partial verifiability, we identify the overlooked importance of KL regularization in RLVR and show that a KL trust region is critical for improving offline-to-online predictability; we further introduce success-adaptive scaling to downweight unreliable negative gradients. Across diverse web and mobile benchmarks, GUI-Libra consistently improves both step-wise accuracy and end-to-end task completion. Our results suggest that carefully designed post-training and data curation can unlock significantly stronger task-solving capabilities without costly online data collection. We release our dataset, code, and models to facilitate further research on data-efficient post-training for reasoning-capable GUI agents."}
