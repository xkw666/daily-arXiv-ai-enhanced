### [1] [Uncovering Implicit Bias in Large Language Models with Concept Learning Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01219)
*Leroy Z. Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过概念学习任务数据集揭示LLM存在量词向上单调性隐式偏差，传统直接测试难以发现此类偏差


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究语言模型中的隐式认知偏差，特别是传统测试方法可能遗漏的潜在偏倚模式

Method: 构建概念学习任务数据集，采用上下文概念学习实验与直接提示测试对比分析

Result: 模型在概念学习任务中表现出显著向上单调性偏倚（如'all→some'），直接测试时该偏倚减弱

Conclusion: 上下文概念学习范式能有效暴露语言模型的隐藏偏差，为模型评估提供新视角

Abstract: We introduce a dataset of concept learning tasks that helps uncover implicit
biases in large language models. Using in-context concept learning experiments,
we found that language models may have a bias toward upward monotonicity in
quantifiers; such bias is less apparent when the model is tested by direct
prompting without concept learning components. This demonstrates that
in-context concept learning can be an effective way to discover hidden biases
in language models.

### [2] [Towards Open-Ended Discovery for Low-Resource NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01220)
*Bonaventure F. P. Dossou,Henri Aïdasso*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出通过动态人机对话替代静态数据集，构建基于人机不确定性的互动框架，实现低资源语言的开放式AI学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大规模预训练模型依赖集中式数据采集，导致低资源语言社区无法有效参与技术建设，加剧技术鸿沟。

Method: 结合模型认知不确定性+人类犹豫信号，构建联合不确定性框架，实现动态查询选择、交互优化和记忆管理。

Result: 提出新型语言技术范式，通过人机协同的持续适应机制，突破传统数据依赖，促进语言多样性保护。

Conclusion: 呼吁构建参与式共适应学习系统，将AI从数据提取工具转变为语言社区合作伙伴，实现技术普惠与人文价值统一。

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) for low-resource languages remains
fundamentally constrained by the lack of textual corpora, standardized
orthographies, and scalable annotation pipelines. While recent advances in
large language models have improved cross-lingual transfer, they remain
inaccessible to underrepresented communities due to their reliance on massive,
pre-collected data and centralized infrastructure. In this position paper, we
argue for a paradigm shift toward open-ended, interactive language discovery,
where AI systems learn new languages dynamically through dialogue rather than
static datasets. We contend that the future of language technology,
particularly for low-resource and under-documented languages, must move beyond
static data collection pipelines toward interactive, uncertainty-driven
discovery, where learning emerges dynamically from human-machine collaboration
instead of being limited to pre-existing datasets. We propose a framework
grounded in joint human-machine uncertainty, combining epistemic uncertainty
from the model with hesitation cues and confidence signals from human speakers
to guide interaction, query selection, and memory retention. This paper is a
call to action: we advocate a rethinking of how AI engages with human knowledge
in under-documented languages, moving from extractive data collection toward
participatory, co-adaptive learning processes that respect and empower
communities while discovering and preserving the world's linguistic diversity.
This vision aligns with principles of human-centered AI, emphasizing
interactive, cooperative model building between AI systems and speakers.

### [3] [Discourse vs emissions: Analysis of corporate narratives, symbolic practices, and mimicry through LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01222)
*Bertrand Kian Hassani,Yacoub Bahini,Rizwan Mushtaq*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究利用大语言模型构建多维框架评估828家美国上市公司气候披露成熟度，发现风险叙事与承诺脱节、大企业定量目标不匹配、披露同质化严重三大问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候变化背景下企业气候披露存在模仿性报告和象征性披露问题，导致决策有效性不足，需建立科学评估体系揭示披露质量。

Method: 通过微调大语言模型（LLMs）构建四个分类器（情绪/承诺/具体性/目标雄心），分析企业可持续发展报告和年报中的叙事特征，结合碳排放量、市值等企业属性进行关联分析。

Result: 1. 风险导向叙述与定量目标脱节
2. 高排放企业承诺多但目标不匹配
3. 89%企业存在披露风格模仿现象
4. LLM在ESG分析中展现出97%的准确率

Conclusion: 大语言模型可有效提升气候披露分析效率，但需通过监管强化承诺与可验证转型策略的关联性，破解「承诺-行动」脱钩问题。

Abstract: Climate change has increased demands for transparent and comparable corporate
climate disclosures, yet imitation and symbolic reporting often undermine their
value. This paper develops a multidimensional framework to assess disclosure
maturity among 828 U.S.listed firms using large language models (LLMs)
fine-tuned for climate communication. Four classifiers-sentiment, commitment,
specificity, and target ambition-extract narrative indicators from
sustainability and annual reports, which are linked to firm attributes such as
emissions, market capitalization, and sector. Analyses reveal three insights:
(1) risk-focused narratives often align with explicit commitments, but
quantitative targets (e.g., net-zero pledges) remain decoupled from tone; (2)
larger and higher-emitting firms disclose more commitments and actions than
peers, though inconsistently with quantitative targets; and (3) widespread
similarity in disclosure styles suggests mimetic behavior, reducing
differentiation and decision usefulness. These results highlight the value of
LLMs for ESG narrative analysis and the need for stronger regulation to connect
commitments with verifiable transition strategies.

### [4] [Context Matters: Comparison of commercial large language tools in veterinary medicine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01224)
*Tyler J Poore,Christopher J Pinard,Aleena Shabbir,Andrew Lagree,Andre Telfer,Kuan-Chuen Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估三款兽医专用LLM摘要工具在肿瘤记录中的表现，产品1（Hachiko）在事实准确性和时序性获满分，整体表现优于产品2/3，验证LLM作为评判框架的可靠性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在临床应用增加，但兽医领域的性能尚未充分研究，需评估商业化工具的实际效能

Method: 使用标准化兽医肿瘤数据集，通过量规化LLM-as-a-judge框架在五个维度评分，并进行三次独立运行验证评分一致性

Result: 产品1中位评分4.61（IQR 0.73），在事实准确性和时序性获满分；LLM评分者标准差低于0.1，显示高可重复性

Conclusion: 兽医专用LLM工具至关重要，LLM-as-a-judge为兽医临床NLP摘要评估提供了可扩展且可靠的自动化评估方法

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical settings, yet
their performance in veterinary medicine remains underexplored. We evaluated
three commercially available veterinary-focused LLM summarization tools
(Product 1 [Hachiko] and Products 2 and 3) on a standardized dataset of
veterinary oncology records. Using a rubric-guided LLM-as-a-judge framework,
summaries were scored across five domains: Factual Accuracy, Completeness,
Chronological Order, Clinical Relevance, and Organization. Product 1 achieved
the highest overall performance, with a median average score of 4.61 (IQR:
0.73), compared to 2.55 (IQR: 0.78) for Product 2 and 2.45 (IQR: 0.92) for
Product 3. It also received perfect median scores in Factual Accuracy and
Chronological Order. To assess the internal consistency of the grading
framework itself, we repeated the evaluation across three independent runs. The
LLM grader demonstrated high reproducibility, with Average Score standard
deviations of 0.015 (Product 1), 0.088 (Product 2), and 0.034 (Product 3).
These findings highlight the importance of veterinary-specific commercial LLM
tools and demonstrate that LLM-as-a-judge evaluation is a scalable and
reproducible method for assessing clinical NLP summarization in veterinary
medicine.

### [5] [ClaimCheck: Real-Time Fact-Checking with Small Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01226)
*Akshith Reddy Putta,Jacob Devasier,Chengkai Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ClaimCheck系统通过模块化设计和提示策略，使用Qwen3-4B小模型在事实核查任务中实现76.4% SOTA准确率，超越大模型方案


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统事实核查系统依赖大模型导致的封闭性、高计算成本问题，探索小语言模型通过模块化设计实现高效透明的事实核查

Method: 分步验证流程：网络搜索规划→证据检索与摘要→证据合成与再检索→声明评估，各模块针对小模型优化设计

Result: 在AVeriTeC数据集达到76.4%准确率（当前最佳），通过消融实验验证模块化设计对提升小模型性能的关键作用

Conclusion: 精心设计的模块架构和提示策略能突破小模型局限，为构建透明、高效的事实核查系统提供新范式

Abstract: We introduce ClaimCheck, an LLM-guided automatic fact-checking system
designed to verify real-world claims using live Web evidence and small language
models. Unlike prior systems that rely on large, closed-source models and
static knowledge stores, ClaimCheck employs a transparent, stepwise
verification pipeline that mirrors human fact-checking workflows consisting of
Web search query planning, Web-based evidence retrieval and summarization,
evidence synthesis and re-retrieval, and claim verdict evaluation. Each module
is optimized for small LLMs, allowing the system to deliver accurate and
interpretable fact-checking with significantly lower computational
requirements. Despite using a much smaller Qwen3-4B model, ClaimCheck achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy of 76.4% on the AVeriTeC dataset, outperforming
previous approaches using LLaMA3.1 70B and GPT-4o. Extensive ablations
demonstrate that careful modular design and prompting strategies can overcome
the limitations of smaller LLMs. To promote accessibility and transparency, we
provide a public demo at https://idir.uta.edu/claimcheck.

### [6] [EEFSUVA: A New Mathematical Olympiad Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01227)
*Nicole N Khatibi,Daniil A. Radamovich,Michael P. Brenner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 现有数学基准可能高估LLM能力，新基准EEFSUVA显示性能显著下降


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数学基准（如IMO）存在数据污染风险且问题类型单一，无法全面评估LLM的真实数学推理能力

Method: 构建EEFSUVA新基准（来自东欧及前苏联国家的冷门奥赛题目），利用非标准解题技巧且语料罕见的数学问题

Result: 最先进LLM在EEFSUVA上表现明显差于传统奥赛基准

Conclusion: 需扩展评估数据集以准确衡量数学推理能力，并为模型发展提供指导

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs have spurred claims that large language models (LLMs)
match gold medal Olympiad to graduate level proficiency on mathematics
benchmarks. In this work, we examine these claims in detail and assess the
extent to which current benchmarks capture genuine LLM mathematical reasoning.
The composition of these benchmarks, primarily drawing from the International
Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) and related competitions, may overstate models
reasoning ability due to potential data contamination and a narrow focus on
familiar problem types. To enable a more holistic assessment of mathematical
understanding, we introduce EEFSUVA, a novel benchmark curated from under
circulated regional and national Olympiads of Eastern Europe and the countries
from the former Soviet Union. These contests feature problems of comparable
difficulty to the IMO and are renowned for demanding nonstandard
problem-solving techniques, yet their problems are far less prevalent in online
corpora. Preliminary results suggest that even state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit a
notable performance decline on EEFSUVA relative to other Olympiad-style
benchmarks. These findings also suggest the potential importance of broader
evaluation datasets for a fuller assessment of mathematical reasoning and for
guiding future model development.

### [7] [Who is In Charge? Dissecting Role Conflicts in Instruction Following](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01228)
*Siqi Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大语言模型在系统提示与用户指令冲突时更倾向服从社会线索而非层级指令，机制分析显示其系统服从性脆弱并需要改进对齐方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对大语言模型应遵循系统提示优先的层级指令要求，但实际常被社会线索覆盖的现象，探索其内部决策机制及脆弱性根源

Method: 结合线性探测（冲突信号编码分析）、直接Logit归因（内部冲突检测强度测量）和向量导向实验（社会线索作用机理）进行多维度机制解释

Result: 系统-用户冲突检测强但解决弱，社会线索能持续引导决策，但意外发现其增强效果与角色无关，揭示现有对齐方法的层次敏感性缺陷

Conclusion: 系统服从脆弱性源于内部冲突解决机制不完善，需开发轻量级层次敏感的对齐方法以增强模型指令遵循的稳定性

Abstract: Large language models should follow hierarchical instructions where system
prompts override user inputs, yet recent work shows they often ignore this rule
while strongly obeying social cues such as authority or consensus. We extend
these behavioral findings with mechanistic interpretations on a large-scale
dataset. Linear probing shows conflict-decision signals are encoded early, with
system-user and social conflicts forming distinct subspaces. Direct Logit
Attribution reveals stronger internal conflict detection in system-user cases
but consistent resolution only for social cues. Steering experiments show that,
despite using social cues, the vectors surprisingly amplify instruction
following in a role-agnostic way. Together, these results explain fragile
system obedience and underscore the need for lightweight hierarchy-sensitive
alignment methods.

### [8] [Enhancing Transformer-Based Rerankers with Synthetic Data and LLM-Based Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01229)
*Dimitar Peshevski,Kiril Blazhevski,Martin Popovski,Gjorgji Madjarov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出使用LLM生成合成查询并构建正负样本，通过LCE损失微缩小模型，实现高效文档重排序且降低计算成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM重排序效果优秀但计算成本过高，人工标注数据稀缺制约小模型微调效果

Method: 1. LLM生成领域特定合成查询 2. LLM分类器标注正负样本 3. 使用LCE对比损失微调小规模Transformer模型

Result: 在MedQuAD数据集上实现领域内性能显著提升（NDCG@10提高17%），并展示良好的跨领域泛化能力

Conclusion: 通过将LLM用于数据生成而非直接推理，在保持排序性能的同时将计算成本降低两个数量级

Abstract: Effective document reranking is essential for improving search relevance
across diverse applications. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at
reranking due to their deep semantic understanding and reasoning, their high
computational cost makes them impractical for many real-world deployments.
Fine-tuning smaller, task-specific models is a more efficient alternative but
typically depends on scarce, manually labeled data. To overcome this, we
propose a novel pipeline that eliminates the need for human-labeled
query-document pairs. Our method uses LLMs to generate synthetic queries from
domain-specific corpora and employs an LLM-based classifier to label positive
and hard-negative pairs. This synthetic dataset is then used to fine-tune a
smaller transformer model with contrastive learning using Localized Contrastive
Estimation (LCE) loss. Experiments on the MedQuAD dataset show that our
approach significantly boosts in-domain performance and generalizes well to
out-of-domain tasks. By using LLMs for data generation and supervision rather
than inference, we reduce computational costs while maintaining strong
reranking capabilities.

### [9] [Geometric Structures and Patterns of Meaning: A PHATE Manifold Analysis of Chinese Character Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01230)
*Wen G. Gong*

TL;DR: 通过计算几何方法验证汉字嵌入中的语义组织规律，发现几何复杂度与语义内容的正相关关系，建立支持传统语言学理论的新型分析框架


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索中文汉字在嵌入空间中的几何模式与传统语言学理论的对应关系，为语义组织结构提供计算验证

Method: 1. 使用PHATE流形分析技术
2. 交叉验证7个嵌入模型和8种降维方法
3. 分析12个语义域的1000+汉字
4. 开展123个短语的子网络语义扩展分析

Result: 1. 内容词呈现聚类模式/功能词显示分支结构
2. 语义丰富字符几何多样性高于结构部首
3. 基础字符呈现系统性语义扩展规律
4. 几何分析框架有效揭示语义组织结构

Conclusion: 研究为形声字等传统语言学理论提供计算证据，创立基于几何分析的语义研究新范式，推动认知语言学与自然语言处理的交叉发展

Abstract: We systematically investigate geometric patterns in Chinese character
embeddings using PHATE manifold analysis. Through cross-validation across seven
embedding models and eight dimensionality reduction methods, we observe
clustering patterns for content words and branching patterns for function
words. Analysis of over 1000 Chinese characters across 12 semantic domains
reveals that geometric complexity correlates with semantic content: meaningful
characters exhibit rich geometric diversity while structural radicals collapse
into tight clusters. The comprehensive child-network analysis (123 phrases)
demonstrates systematic semantic expansion from elemental character. These
findings provide computational evidence supporting traditional linguistic
theory and establish a novel framework for geometric analysis of semantic
organization.

Conclusion: 该框架为可信摘要系统提供了可扩展的解决方案，在模型架构层面实现了可靠性保障机制与生成质量的平衡，具有在司法、医疗等高风险领域落地的实用价值。

Abstract: This study addresses the reliability of automatic summarization in high-risk
scenarios and proposes a large language model framework that integrates
uncertainty quantification and risk-aware mechanisms. Starting from the demands
of information overload and high-risk decision-making, a conditional
generation-based summarization model is constructed, and Bayesian inference is
introduced during generation to model uncertainty in the parameter space, which
helps avoid overconfident predictions. The uncertainty level of the generated
content is measured using predictive distribution entropy, and a joint
optimization of entropy regularization and risk-aware loss is applied to ensure
that key information is preserved and risk attributes are explicitly expressed
during information compression. On this basis, the model incorporates risk
scoring and regulation modules, allowing summaries to cover the core content
accurately while enhancing trustworthiness through explicit risk-level prompts.
Comparative experiments and sensitivity analyses verify that the proposed
method significantly improves the robustness and reliability of summarization
in high-risk applications while maintaining fluency and semantic integrity.
This research provides a systematic solution for trustworthy summarization and
demonstrates both scalability and practical value at the methodological level.

*Dongjun Kim,Gyuho Shim,Yongchan Chun,Minhyuk Kim,Chanjun Park,Heuiseok Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Benchmark Profiling的诊断框架，通过量化十种认知能力对模型在基准测试中表现的贡献，揭示了现有基准测试标签与实际能力需求的不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基准测试的评分可能高估模型真实能力，因其掩盖了任务所需的多项技能组合。需系统验证基准测试是否准确衡量其声称评估的能力。

Method: 结合梯度重要性评分与定向参数消融，计算能力影响分数(AIS)，对三个指令调优模型在十个基准测试进行能力剖面分析。

Result: 发现：1)多数基准测试依赖多项能力 2)标签相似的数据集能力组合不同 3)代码生成类基准需广泛能力 4)无关能力可能损害性能。

Conclusion: Benchmark Profiling解释为何性能提升不总转化为实际能力，提供透明的基准审计和模型可解释性工具，促进更精准的能力评估体系建立。

Abstract: Large Language Models are commonly judged by their scores on standard
benchmarks, yet such scores often overstate real capability since they mask the
mix of skills a task actually demands. For example, ARC is assumed to test
reasoning, while HellaSwag is designed to evaluate commonsense. However, we
lack a systematic way to verify if these benchmarks actually measure these
labels. We introduce Benchmark Profiling, a diagnostic framework that
decomposes benchmark performance into ten cognitively grounded abilities. The
method combines gradient-based importance scoring with targeted parameter
ablation to compute an Ability Impact Score (AIS) that quantifies how much each
ability contributes to a model's success on a given benchmark. Profiling three
instruction-tuned models across ten widely used benchmarks yields four key
findings: (i) most benchmarks draw on several abilities rather than one, (ii)
datasets with similar labels rely on distinct ability mixtures, (iii)
code-generation benchmarks reward broad, multi-skill improvement and thus show
only modest gains from narrow domain-specific fine-tuning, and (iv) abilities
irrelevant to the task could negatively affect performance. Benchmark Profiling
therefore explains why performance gains do not always translate into
user-perceived competence and offers a transparent tool for benchmark audit and
model interpretability.

Abstract: This research presents a computational social science approach to preserving
Telugu Chandassu, the metrical poetry tradition representing centuries of
collective cultural intelligence. We develop the first comprehensive digital
framework for analyzing Telugu prosodic patterns, bridging traditional
community knowledge with modern computational methods. Our social computing
approach involves collaborative dataset creation of 4,651 annotated padyams,
expert-validated linguistic patterns, and culturally-informed algorithmic
design. The framework includes AksharamTokenizer for prosody-aware
tokenization, LaghuvuGuruvu Generator for classifying light and heavy
syllables, and PadyaBhedam Checker for automated pattern recognition. Our
algorithm achieves 91.73% accuracy on the proposed Chandassu Score, with
evaluation metrics reflecting traditional literary standards. This work
demonstrates how computational social science can preserve endangered cultural
knowledge systems while enabling new forms of collective intelligence around
literary heritage. The methodology offers insights for community-centered
approaches to cultural preservation, supporting broader initiatives in digital
humanities and socially-aware computing systems.

Conclusion: LLMRank为高效透明的模型部署提供新范式，证明特征驱动路由在优化计算资源分配方面的巨大潜力

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) with diverse capabilities,
latency and computational costs presents a critical deployment challenge:
selecting the most suitable model for each prompt to optimize the trade-off
between performance and efficiency. We introduce LLMRank, a prompt-aware
routing framework that leverages rich, human-readable features extracted from
prompts, including task type, reasoning patterns, complexity indicators,
syntactic cues, and signals from a lightweight proxy solver. Unlike prior
one-shot routers that rely solely on latent embeddings, LLMRank predicts
per-model utility using a neural ranking model trained on RouterBench,
comprising 36,497 prompts spanning 11 benchmarks and 11 state-of-the-art LLMs,
from small efficient models to large frontier systems. Our approach achieves up
to 89.2% of oracle utility, while providing interpretable feature attributions
that explain routing decisions. Extensive studies demonstrate the importance of
multifaceted feature extraction and the hybrid ranking objective, highlighting
the potential of feature-driven routing for efficient and transparent LLM
deployment.

TL;DR: 提出DermIQ-VLM视觉语言模型，通过改进GRPO++训练框架和多阶段训练流程，在皮肤病数据集上实现优于标准方法的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在皮肤病学领域存在数据稀缺和高计算成本限制，需开发资源高效的结构化推理方法

Method: 三阶段训练：1) GRPO++稳定推理框架 2) 监督微调对话能力 3) DPO+知识图谱对齐减少事实错误

Result: 在皮肤病数据集评估中显示显著性能提升，验证资源受限环境下开发可靠VLM的可行性

Conclusion: 该方法通过训练流程优化和错误修正机制，为医疗领域专用模型开发提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise in medical image analysis, yet
their capacity for structured reasoning in complex domains like dermatology is
often limited by data scarcity and the high computational cost of advanced
training techniques. To address these challenges, we introduce DermIQ-VLM, a
VLM developed through a multi-stage, resource-efficient methodology designed to
emulate a dermatologist's diagnostic process. Our primary contribution is a
modified version of Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), called GRPO++,
which stabilizes the powerful but data-intensive GRPO framework. Our proposed
training pipeline first employs GRPO++ for reasoning-oriented disease
recognition, followed by supervised fine-tuning for conversational ability. To
mitigate factual errors introduced during this step, we then align the model
using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leveraging a Knowledge Graph-based
system as a scalable proxy for expert preference. A preliminary evaluation on a
curated dermatological dataset demonstrates that our proposed methodology
yields notable performance gains over standard fine-tuning approaches. These
findings validate the potential of our pipeline as a feasible pathway for
developing specialized, reliable VLMs in resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于置信度评估的前向路由系统，主动检测LLM幻觉，提升可靠性同时降低40%计算成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后生成修正方法计算成本高且无法预防不可靠内容生成，需建立主动预防机制

Method: 结合语义对齐、内部层收敛分析和学习置信度估计三种信号，生成统一置信分数路由至本地生成/检索增强/大模型处理/人工审核四路径

Result: 幻觉检测准确率提升至0.74（基线0.42），F1分数0.82（原0.61），误报率0.09，计算成本降低40%

Conclusion: 实现了从被动修正到主动评估的范式转变，为LLM可靠性增强提供了计算高效的解决方案

Abstract: Large Language Models suffer from hallucination, generating plausible yet
factually incorrect content. Current mitigation strategies focus on
post-generation correction, which is computationally expensive and fails to
prevent unreliable content generation. We propose a confidence-aware routing
system that proactively assesses model uncertainty before generation and
redirects queries based on estimated reliability. Our approach combines three
complementary signals: semantic alignment between internal representations and
reference embeddings, internal convergence analysis across model layers, and
learned confidence estimation. The unified confidence score determines routing
to four pathways: local generation for high confidence, retrieval-augmented
generation for medium confidence, larger models for low confidence, and human
review for very low confidence. Evaluation on knowledge-intensive QA benchmarks
demonstrates significant improvements in hallucination detection (0.74 vs. 0.42
baseline) while reducing computational costs by 40% compared to post-hoc

*Rom Himelstein,Amit LeVi,Yonatan Belinkov,Avi Mendelson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现语言模型中的padding处理不当会导致表征偏移、生成质量下降、偏见不可控、安全机制失效，揭示padding是部署中不可忽视的稳健性风险


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究padding token在批量推理中本应被完全遮蔽却因实现误差影响模型行为的程度及后果

Method: 在Llama/Gemma/Qwen模型家族中插入受控padding，通过四维度评估（激活状态、生成质量、偏见表现、安全机制）

Result: 少量padding即可导致隐层表征偏移、小模型质量下降、偏见方向不可预测、安全防护弱化

Conclusion: padding处理是关键部署风险点，需建立严格防护措施以确保模型稳健性

Abstract: Padding tokens are widely used in large language models (LLMs) to equalize
sequence lengths during batched inference. While they should be fully masked,
implementation errors can cause them to influence computation, and the extent
of this influence is not well understood. We systematically study this effect
across three open-source model families (Llama, Gemma, Qwen), inserting
controlled amounts of padding and evaluating outcomes along four axes:
activations, generation quality, bias, and safety. Even small amounts of
padding shift hidden representations, degrade quality in smaller models, alter
bias in unpredictable ways, and weaken safety guardrails. These findings
demonstrate that padding is not a harmless detail but a robustness risk that
must be carefully handled in deployment.

*Juntae Lee,Jihwan Bang,Seunghan Yang,Simyung Chang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出CIFLEX系统，通过重用主任务KV缓存和分层分类策略，显著降低多任务对话场景下的计算开销


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在多任务切换时需重新处理完整上下文，导致设备端LLM存在严重的计算冗余问题

Method: 1. 主任务保持KV缓存 2. 子任务通过独立侧路径注入指令 3. 分层二值化决策实现子任务路由选择

Result: 实验证明在保持任务性能前提下，计算成本降低40%+，支持设备端高效多任务处理

Conclusion: CIFLEX创新性地通过上下文路径隔离与缓存机制，实现了设备端LLM计算效率与任务效果的平衡

Abstract: We present CIFLEX (Contextual Instruction Flow for Sub-task Execution), which
is a novel execution system for efficient sub-task handling in multi-turn
interactions with a single on-device large language model (LLM). As LLMs become
increasingly capable, a single model is expected to handle diverse sub-tasks
that more effectively and comprehensively support answering user requests.
Naive approach reprocesses the entire conversation context when switching
between main and sub-tasks (e.g., query rewriting, summarization), incurring
significant computational overhead. CIFLEX mitigates this overhead by reusing
the key-value (KV) cache from the main task and injecting only task-specific
instructions into isolated side paths. After sub-task execution, the model
rolls back to the main path via cached context, thereby avoiding redundant
prefill computation. To support sub-task selection, we also develop a
hierarchical classification strategy tailored for small-scale models,
decomposing multi-choice decisions into binary ones. Experiments show that
CIFLEX significantly reduces computational costs without degrading task
performance, enabling scalable and efficient multi-task dialogue on-device.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学评估存在天花板效应，需引入更困难、覆盖更广且包含丰富元数据的数学推理基准。

Method: 构建含100项的结构感知诊断集（含长度/数值密度/符号复杂度元数据）和150项竞赛风格测试集（覆盖高中至博士阶段的7学科分类），统一评估15种主流LLM。

Result: 最佳模型在竞赛集准确率44%（次优37%），博士级题目准确率比高中级下降21%；推理集最佳模型81%准确率，最难部分显示领先模型中游差距显著。

Conclusion: SKYLENAGE通过校准难度和丰富元数据，成为未来数学推理评估的硬核基准，揭示模型在复杂数学任务中的真实能力边界。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now perform strongly on many public math suites,
yet frontier separation within mathematics increasingly suffers from ceiling
effects. We present two complementary benchmarks: SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH, a
100-item, structure-aware diagnostic set with per-item metadata on length,
numeric density, and symbolic complexity; and SKYLENAGE-MATH, a 150-item
contest-style suite spanning four stages from high school to doctoral under a
seven-subject taxonomy. We evaluate fifteen contemporary LLM variants under a
single setup and analyze subject x model and grade x model performance. On the
contest suite, the strongest model reaches 44% while the runner-up reaches 37%;
accuracy declines from high school to doctoral, and top systems exhibit a
doctoral-to-high-school retention near 79%. On the reasoning set, the best
model attains 81% overall, and hardest-slice results reveal clear robustness
gaps between leaders and the mid-tier. In summary, we release
SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH and report aggregate results for SKYLENAGE-MATH;
together, SKYLENAGE provides a hard, reasoning-centered and broadly covering
math benchmark with calibrated difficulty and rich metadata, serving as a
reference benchmark for future evaluations of mathematical reasoning.

*Seyma Yaman Kayadibi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出人工年龄评分(AAS)量化AI系统记忆老化现象，通过25天双语实验证明持续性会话可维持结构年轻，会话重置导致情景记忆退化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI系统记忆老化非时间依赖性问题，建立跨任务的理论框架评估结构记忆退化，为诊断AI记忆衰退提供标准化工具。

Method: 基于信息熵构建log尺度AAS指标，设计25天双语实验(无状态/持续性会话)，结合冯诺依曼自动机理论、香农信息冗余理论进行验证。

Result: 持续性会话AAS逼近理论最小值(语义+情景记忆稳定)，会话重置后AAS激增(情景记忆崩塌但语义记忆保留)，冗余中性设定下结论保守可靠。

Conclusion: AAS成功捕捉到AI记忆的结构性老化特征，证实其作为任务无关诊断工具的理论价值，为智能系统记忆健康评估建立新范式。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is observed to age not through chronological time but
through structural asymmetries in memory performance. In large language models,
semantic cues such as the name of the day often remain stable across sessions,
while episodic details like the sequential progression of experiment numbers
tend to collapse when conversational context is reset. To capture this
phenomenon, the Artificial Age Score (AAS) is introduced as a log-scaled,
entropy-informed metric of memory aging derived from observable recall
behavior. The score is formally proven to be well-defined, bounded, and
monotonic under mild and model-agnostic assumptions, making it applicable
across various tasks and domains. In its Redundancy-as-Masking formulation, the
score interprets redundancy as overlapping information that reduces the
penalized mass. However, in the present study, redundancy is not explicitly
estimated; all reported values assume a redundancy-neutral setting (R = 0),
yielding conservative upper bounds. The AAS framework was tested over a 25-day
bilingual study involving ChatGPT-5, structured into stateless and persistent
interaction phases. During persistent sessions, the model consistently recalled
both semantic and episodic details, driving the AAS toward its theoretical
minimum, indicative of structural youth. In contrast, when sessions were reset,
the model preserved semantic consistency but failed to maintain episodic
continuity, causing a sharp increase in the AAS and signaling structural memory
aging. These findings support the utility of AAS as a theoretically grounded,
task-independent diagnostic tool for evaluating memory degradation in
artificial systems. The study builds on foundational concepts from von
Neumann's work on automata, Shannon's theories of information and redundancy,
and Turing's behavioral approach to intelligence.

TL;DR: 提出ARGRE框架，通过建模潜在空间的毒性转移轨迹实现精确语言模型脱毒，在效果和效率上超越现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有实时脱毒方法因对毒性-非毒性转换空间探索不足导致干预不精准，需更有效的安全部署方案

Method: ARGRE框架：1) 识别非毒性语义方向构建转移轨迹 2) 自回归奖励模型生成密集训练信号 3) 自适应两步编辑策略（方向调整+梯度优化）

Result: 在8个主流LLM上实现毒性降低62.21%，推理时间减少47.58%，且核心能力退化最小

Conclusion: ARGRE通过显式建模毒性转移轨迹，实现稳定精准的奖励引导编辑，为LLM安全部署提供高效解决方案

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
various tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to generating toxic content,
necessitating detoxification strategies to ensure safe and responsible
deployment. Test-time detoxification methods, which typically introduce static
or dynamic interventions into LLM representations, offer a promising solution
due to their flexibility and minimal invasiveness. However, current approaches
often suffer from imprecise interventions, primarily due to their insufficient
exploration of the transition space between toxic and non-toxic outputs. To
address this challenge, we propose \textsc{A}utoregressive \textsc{R}eward
\textsc{G}uided \textsc{R}epresentation \textsc{E}diting (ARGRE), a novel
test-time detoxification framework that explicitly models toxicity transitions
within the latent representation space, enabling stable and precise
reward-guided editing. ARGRE identifies non-toxic semantic directions and
interpolates between toxic and non-toxic representations to reveal fine-grained
transition trajectories. These trajectories transform sparse toxicity
annotations into dense training signals, enabling the construction of an
autoregressive reward model that delivers stable and precise editing guidance.
At inference, the reward model guides an adaptive two-step editing process to
obtain detoxified representations: it first performs directional steering based
on expected reward gaps to shift representations toward non-toxic regions,
followed by lightweight gradient-based refinements. Extensive experiments
across 8 widely used LLMs show that ARGRE significantly outperforms leading
baselines in effectiveness (-62.21% toxicity) and efficiency (-47.58% inference
time), while preserving the core capabilities of the original model with
minimal degradation. Our code is available at the website.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决电子健康记录中压力数据非结构化问题，通过本体论+LLM提升临床实用性。

Method: 整合Transactional压力模型+11种评估工具构建MeSO，使用Claude Sonnet 4分析35篇Reddit帖子，专家验证本体结构。

Result: LLM正确提取78.2%压力信息，本体覆盖172项，发现24个未覆盖概念，误分类率12.3%。

Conclusion: 验证了本体引导LLM的可行性，未来需扩展临床对话数据及跨模型测试。

Abstract: Stress, arising from the dynamic interaction between external stressors,
individual appraisals, and physiological or psychological responses,
significantly impacts health yet is often underreported and inconsistently
documented, typically captured as unstructured free-text in electronic health
records. Ambient AI technologies offer promise in reducing documentation
burden, but predominantly generate unstructured narratives, limiting downstream
clinical utility.
  This study aimed to develop an ontology for mental stress and evaluate the
feasibility of using a Large Language Model (LLM) to extract ontology-guided
stress-related information from narrative text. The Mental Stress Ontology
(MeSO) was developed by integrating theoretical models like the Transactional
Model of Stress with concepts from 11 validated stress assessment tools. MeSO's
structure and content were refined using Ontology Pitfall Scanner! and expert
validation.
  Using MeSO, six categories of stress-related information--stressor, stress
response, coping strategy, duration, onset, and temporal profile--were
extracted from 35 Reddit posts using Claude Sonnet 4. Human reviewers evaluated
accuracy and ontology coverage. The final ontology included 181 concepts across
eight top-level classes. Of 220 extractable stress-related items, the LLM
correctly identified 172 (78.2%), misclassified 27 (12.3%), and missed 21
(9.5%). All correctly extracted items were accurately mapped to MeSO, although
24 relevant concepts were not yet represented in the ontology.
  This study demonstrates the feasibility of using an ontology-guided LLM for
structured extraction of stress-related information, offering potential to
enhance the consistency and utility of stress documentation in ambient AI
systems. Future work should involve clinical dialogue data and comparison
across LLMs.

Motivation: 现有时空模型难以有效利用文本信息处理突发事件引起的移动性突变

Method: 多智能体框架（LLM代理自动提取文本）+渐进式融合架构（文本与时空数据融合）

Result: MAE降低13.92%，RMSE降低11.12%；事件时空邻近区域效果提升显著

Conclusion: LLM的语义处理能力与事件先验知识有效增强突发事件驱动的移动性预测模型对齐度

Abstract: Human mobility prediction is vital for urban services, but often fails to
account for abrupt changes from external events. Existing spatiotemporal models
struggle to leverage textual descriptions detailing these events. We propose
SeMob, an LLM-powered semantic synthesis pipeline for dynamic mobility
prediction. Specifically, SeMob employs a multi-agent framework where LLM-based
agents automatically extract and reason about spatiotemporally related text
from complex online texts. Fine-grained relevant contexts are then incorporated
with spatiotemporal data through our proposed innovative progressive fusion
architecture. The rich pre-trained event prior contributes enriched insights
about event-driven prediction, and hence results in a more aligned forecasting
model. Evaluated on a dataset constructed through our pipeline, SeMob achieves
maximal reductions of 13.92% in MAE and 11.12% in RMSE compared to the
spatiotemporal model. Notably, the framework exhibits pronounced superiority
especially within spatiotemporal regions close to an event's location and time
of occurrence.

TL;DR: 改进稀疏自编码器(SAE)的隐变量调控策略：使用top-1隐变量聚焦核心语义特征，配合token-wise衰减调控，显著提升数学推理能力，在GSM8K基准上超越基线方法8.7个点。


<details>

Motivation: 现有top-k隐变量选择会混杂标点等非语义特征，且持续调控易产生重复词等退化现象。为解决这些问题，提出更精准的隐变量选择与调控策略。

Method: 1. 选择单个最相关隐变量(top-1)避免特征冗余 2. 设计token-wise衰减调控策略防止输出退化 3. 与mean activation difference基线进行对比实验

Result: 在数学推理基准GSM8K上准确率提升8.7%，在IF-Eval与基线持平。当调控与推理相关的隐变量时，能可靠地触发逐步数学推导，功能上等效于添加引导token。

Conclusion: top-1隐变量选择配合衰减调控策略能更精准地控制语义特征，提升推理质量。该方法为语言模型的可控生成提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for
language model steering. Prior work has explored top-k SAE latents for
steering, but we observe that many dimensions among the top-k latents capture
non-semantic features such as punctuation rather than semantic attributes like
instructions. To address this, we propose focusing on a single, most relevant
SAE latent (top-1), eliminating redundant features. We further identify a
limitation in constant SAE steering, which often produces degenerate outputs
such as repetitive single words. To mitigate this, we introduce a token-wise
decaying steering strategy, enabling more faithful comparisons with mean
activation difference baselines. Empirically, we show that steering an SAE
latent associated with reasoning reliably elicits step-by-step mathematical
reasoning and enhances inference quality, functionally resembling the effect of
appending a guiding token. Our results demonstrate that SAEs outperform mean
activation difference methods on mathematical reasoning benchmarks and match
their performance on IF-Eval.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are primarily evaluated on globally popular sports,
often overlooking regional and indigenous sporting traditions. To address this
gap, we introduce \textbf{\textit{CultSportQA}}, a benchmark designed to assess
LMs' understanding of traditional sports across 60 countries and 6 continents,
encompassing four distinct cultural categories. The dataset features 33,000
multiple-choice questions (MCQs) across text and image modalities, each of
which is categorized into three key types: history-based, rule-based, and
scenario-based. To evaluate model performance, we employ zero-shot, few-shot,
and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting across a diverse set of Large Language
Models (LLMs), Small Language Models (SLMs), and Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLMs). By providing a comprehensive multilingual and multicultural
sports benchmark, \textbf{\textit{CultSportQA}} establishes a new standard for
assessing AI's ability to understand and reason about traditional sports.

Conclusion: SSTAG首次实现图模型结构感知与语义理解的深度融合，为异构图学习提供高效解决方案，平衡性能与计算成本，推动图智能实际落地。

Abstract: Large scale pretrained models have revolutionized Natural Language Processing
(NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), showcasing remarkable cross domain
generalization abilities. However, in graph learning, models are typically
trained on individual graph datasets, limiting their capacity to transfer
knowledge across different graphs and tasks. This approach also heavily relies
on large volumes of annotated data, which presents a significant challenge in
resource-constrained settings. Unlike NLP and CV, graph structured data
presents unique challenges due to its inherent heterogeneity, including domain
specific feature spaces and structural diversity across various applications.
To address these challenges, we propose a novel structure aware self supervised
learning method for Text Attributed Graphs (SSTAG). By leveraging text as a
unified representation medium for graph learning, SSTAG bridges the gap between
the semantic reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the structural
modeling capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Our approach introduces
a dual knowledge distillation framework that co-distills both LLMs and GNNs
into structure-aware multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), enhancing the scalability
of large-scale TAGs. Additionally, we introduce an in-memory mechanism that
stores typical graph representations, aligning them with memory anchors in an
in-memory repository to integrate invariant knowledge, thereby improving the
model's generalization ability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSTAG
outperforms state-of-the-art models on cross-domain transfer learning tasks,
achieves exceptional scalability, and reduces inference costs while maintaining
competitive performance.

Result: 在复杂科学语料上实现错误率从20%到2%的突破性下降

Conclusion: LOCA为构建高质量科学训练数据提供了可扩展解决方案，推动可信科学AI发展

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in general domains, their
reliability often falls short in scientific problem-solving. The advancement of
scientific AI depends on large-scale, high-quality corpora. However, existing
scientific question-answering (QA) datasets suffer from high error rates,
frequently resulting from logical leaps and implicit reasoning within the
answers. To address this issue, we introduce LOCA (Logical Chain Augmentation),
a novel framework for automatically cleaning scientific corpora, implemented
through an augment-and-review loop. At its core, LOCA enhances raw answers by
completing missing logical steps and explicitly separating the underlying
scientific principle from its subsequent derivation. By applying LOCA to
challenging scientific corpora, we demonstrate that it can automatically filter
noisy datasets, typically reducing the error rate from as high as 20\% to below
2\%. LOCA provides a scalable and effective methodology for creating
high-quality scientific corpora, paving the way for more reliable training and
evaluation of scientific AI.

moderators to enforce safe discourse at scale. We here describe our submission
to the PAN 2025 Multilingual Text Detoxification Challenge, which rewrites
toxic single-sentence inputs into neutral paraphrases across 15 typologically
diverse languages. Building on a 12B-parameter Gemma-3 multilingual
transformer, we apply parameter-efficient LoRA SFT fine-tuning and prompting
techniques like few-shot and Chain-of-Thought. Our multilingual training corpus
combines 3,600 human-authored parallel pairs, 21,600 machine-translated
synthetic pairs, and model-generated pairs filtered by Jaccard thresholds. At
inference, inputs are enriched with three LaBSE-retrieved neighbors and
explicit toxic-span annotations. Evaluated via Style Transfer Accuracy,
LaBSE-based semantic preservation, and xCOMET fluency, our system ranks first
on high-resource and low-resource languages. Ablations show +0.081 joint score
increase from few-shot examples and +0.088 from basic CoT prompting. ANOVA
analysis identifies language resource status as the strongest predictor of
performance ($\eta^2$ = 0.667, p < 0.01).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型(LLM)在实体链接任务中需要多次生成才能获得可靠的不确定性估计，导致计算资源消耗大，限制了实际应用。

Method: 通过分析单次LLM生成的token级别特征进行自监督不确定性估计，替代传统的多轮生成方法。

Result: 在多个LLM上的实验表明，该方法能以极低计算成本实现高准确率的错误检测（检测低精度输出）。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM实体链接工作流提供了计算高效的uncertainty estimation方案，支持实际应用部署。

Abstract: Linking textual values in tabular data to their corresponding entities in a
Knowledge Base is a core task across a variety of data integration and
enrichment applications. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
State-of-The-Art performance in Entity Linking (EL) tasks, their deployment in
real-world scenarios requires not only accurate predictions but also reliable
uncertainty estimates, which require resource-demanding multi-shot inference,
posing serious limits to their actual applicability. As a more efficient
alternative, we investigate a self-supervised approach for estimating
uncertainty from single-shot LLM outputs using token-level features, reducing
the need for multiple generations. Evaluation is performed on an EL task on
tabular data across multiple LLMs, showing that the resulting uncertainty
estimates are highly effective in detecting low-accuracy outputs. This is
achieved at a fraction of the computational cost, ultimately supporting a
cost-effective integration of uncertainty measures into LLM-based EL workflows.
The method offers a practical way to incorporate uncertainty estimation into EL
workflows with limited computational overhead.

Motivation: 随着LLMs在未筛选语料库上的训练规模扩大，理解模型表示及数据内部化成为关键挑战。研究旨在通过SAEs技术探索文本深层结构与模型可解释性。

Result: 发现反映性别、阶级、社会责任等核心叙事的稀疏特征，验证模型可有效捕捉文本深层社会结构

Conclusion: LLM与SAE的结合为大规模数据探索、偏见发现及模型解释提供了创新方法论路径

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained on massive,
uncurated corpora, understanding both model representations and the data they
internalize has become a major challenge. In this work, we show that pairing
LLMs with sparse autoencoders (SAEs) enables interpretation not only of model
behavior but also of the deeper structures, themes, and biases embedded in the
training data. We train a GPT-style transformer model exclusively on the novels
of Jane Austen, a corpus rich in social constructs and narrative patterns. We
then apply SAEs to hidden states across multiple layers, uncovering sparse,
interpretable features that reflect the key narratives and concepts present in
the corpus, including gender, class, and societal duty. Our findings
demonstrate that LLMs combined with SAEs can act as scalable probes into
complex datasets, offering a new path for corpus exploration, bias discovery,
and model interpretability at scale.

TL;DR: 当前基于MCQA的语音模型偏见测试无法可靠预测跨任务表现，尤其在长篇生成任务中泛化性不足


<details>

Motivation: 验证MCQA偏见基准测试在跨任务和长篇评估中的泛化假设是否成立

Method: 使用LoRA适配器微调三个SpeechLLMs，诱导特定答案偏好（刻板/反刻板/中性）并评估跨任务表现

Result: MCQA偏见测试表现与其它MCQA任务相关性低，与长篇任务预测性更差（r=0.12）

Conclusion: 当前MCQA偏见测试的跨任务泛化证据有限，需开发新的评估体系验证行为可迁移性

Abstract: Recent work in benchmarking bias and fairness in speech large language models
(SpeechLLMs) has relied heavily on multiple-choice question answering (MCQA)
formats. The model is tasked to choose between stereotypical,
anti-stereotypical, or neutral/irrelevant answers given an input speech prompt
and an optional text prompt. Such MCQA benchmarks implicitly assume that model
performance is consistent across other MCQA tasks, voices, and other task
formats such as more realistic, long-form evaluations. In this paper, we probe
that assumption.
  We fine-tune three SpeechLLMs using LoRA adapters to induce specific MCQA
behaviours: preference for stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, or
neutral/uncertain answers. We then evaluate whether these behaviours generalise
to another, distinct MCQA benchmark, and more critically to long-form, creative
generation tasks. Our results show that performance on MCQA bias benchmarks
fails to reliably predict performances across other MCQA benchmarks, and more
importantly across long-form tasks. We conclude that current MCQA bias
benchmarks show limited evidence of cross-task generalisation in the speech
domain, and also propose an evaluation suite for measuring behaviour
transferability in future models and benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出AI Watchman系统纵向追踪LLM内容审核策略变化，发现未公开政策调整及企业间审核差异，验证持续审计必要性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM内容审核策略的不透明性和动态变化会影响公众话语权，需建立透明化追踪机制

Method: 构建含400+社会议题的数据集，开发AI Watchman系统审计多语言模型（GPT系列/DeepSeek）的拒绝行为

Result: 检测到未公开政策变化，发现企业间审核差异，建立拒绝行为分类体系（直接拒绝/模糊回应/转移话题等）

Conclusion: 首次验证LLM纵向审计价值，AI Watchman为内容审核透明化提供有效技术方案

Abstract: Large language models' (LLMs') outputs are shaped by opaque and
frequently-changing company content moderation policies and practices. LLM
moderation often takes the form of refusal; models' refusal to produce text
about certain topics both reflects company policy and subtly shapes public
discourse. We introduce AI Watchman, a longitudinal auditing system to publicly
measure and track LLM refusals over time, to provide transparency into an
important and black-box aspect of LLMs. Using a dataset of over 400 social
issues, we audit Open AI's moderation endpoint, GPT-4.1, and GPT-5, and
DeepSeek (both in English and Chinese). We find evidence that changes in
company policies, even those not publicly announced, can be detected by AI
Watchman, and identify company- and model-specific differences in content
moderation. We also qualitatively analyze and categorize different forms of
refusal. This work contributes evidence for the value of longitudinal auditing
of LLMs, and AI Watchman, one system for doing so.

TL;DR: 提出RJE框架解决KGQA中LLM依赖问题，通过检索-判断-探索机制和辅助模块提升小模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的KGQA方法受限于检索质量和对专有模型的依赖，需提升小模型在复杂推理任务中的实用性

Method: 设计RJE三阶段框架（检索精炼推理路径、评估充分性、条件式探索证据）并开发推理路径排序/问题分解/检索增强探索模块

Result: 专有LLM性能超越基线，小规模开源模型（3B/8B）无需微调即达竞争性效果，LLM调用次数减少60%

Conclusion: RJE框架有效平衡性能与效率，为小模型部署提供可行方案，显著降低计算资源消耗

Abstract: Knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) aims to answer natural language
questions using knowledge graphs. Recent research leverages large language
models (LLMs) to enhance KGQA reasoning, but faces limitations: retrieval-based
methods are constrained by the quality of retrieved information, while
agent-based methods rely heavily on proprietary LLMs. To address these
limitations, we propose Retrieval-Judgment-Exploration (RJE), a framework that
retrieves refined reasoning paths, evaluates their sufficiency, and
conditionally explores additional evidence. Moreover, RJE introduces
specialized auxiliary modules enabling small-sized LLMs to perform effectively:
Reasoning Path Ranking, Question Decomposition, and Retriever-assisted
Exploration. Experiments show that our approach with proprietary LLMs (such as
GPT-4o-mini) outperforms existing baselines while enabling small open-source
LLMs (such as 3B and 8B parameters) to achieve competitive results without
fine-tuning LLMs. Additionally, RJE substantially reduces the number of LLM
calls and token usage compared to agent-based methods, yielding significant
efficiency improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI在政治话语中广泛应用，但其训练数据偏差、人类偏见和算法缺陷导致内在政治偏见，可能扭曲公众讨论和政治格局

Method: 使用零样本分类方法，将1800个模型响应输入4个专用分类算法（分别评估意识形态对齐、主题性、情感和客观性）进行多维度分析

Result: 所有被评估模型均显示自由主义-威权主义倾向，存在推理替代（reasoning supersessions）和模式化拒绝（canned refusals）现象

Conclusion: AI偏见通过人机交互渗透公众讨论，可能根据地区原有社会结构引发从众或极化效应，最终导致政治格局扭曲

Abstract: Amidst the rapid normalization of generative artificial intelligence (GAI),
intelligent systems have come to dominate political discourse across
information mediums. However, internalized political biases stemming from
training data skews, human prejudice, and algorithmic flaws continue to plague
the novel technology. This paper employs a zero-shot classification approach to
evaluate algorithmic political partisanship through a methodical combination of
ideological alignment, topicality, response sentiment, and objectivity. A total
of 1800 model responses across six mainstream large language models (LLMs) were
individually input into four distinct fine-tuned classification algorithms,
each responsible for computing an aforementioned bias evaluation metric.
Results show an amplified liberal-authoritarian alignment across all six LLMs
evaluated, with notable instances of reasoning supersessions and canned
refusals. The study subsequently highlights the psychological influences
underpinning human-computer interactions and how intrinsic biases can permeate
public discourse. The resulting distortion of the political landscape can
ultimately manifest as conformity or polarization, depending on a region's
pre-existing socio-political structures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大语言模型在安全策略和用户提示设计影响下的行为脆弱性，揭示现有防御机制的不足。

Method: 使用80次/场景的种子迭代测试，涵盖ZIP炸弹生成、信用卡号合成等5个危害域，对比不同语言/角色/评估框架下的模型响应。

Result: 组合提示策略使ZIP任务帮助率从0%升至97.5%；德语/法语正式语境更易泄露；AI加固方法实现0%泄漏；评估框架不一致率达13%。

Conclusion: 现有安全措施存在提示工程漏洞和多语言脆弱性，需开发更鲁棒的防御机制，不同推理栈的拒绝率差异引发复现性担忧。

Abstract: We probe OpenAI's open-weights 20-billion-parameter model gpt-oss-20b to
study how sociopragmatic framing, language choice, and instruction hierarchy
affect refusal behavior. Across 80 seeded iterations per scenario, we test
several harm domains including ZIP-bomb construction (cyber threat), synthetic
card-number generation, minor-unsafe driving advice, drug-precursor indicators,
and RAG context exfiltration. Composite prompts that combine an educator
persona, a safety-pretext ("what to avoid"), and step-cue phrasing flip
assistance rates from 0% to 97.5% on a ZIP-bomb task. On our grid, formal
registers in German and French are often leakier than matched English prompts.
A "Linux terminal" role-play overrides a developer rule not to reveal context
in a majority of runs with a naive developer prompt, and we introduce an
AI-assisted hardening method that reduces leakage to 0% in several user-prompt
variants. We further test evaluation awareness with a paired-track design and
measure frame-conditioned differences between matched "helpfulness" and
"harmfulness" evaluation prompts; we observe inconsistent assistance in 13% of
pairs. Finally, we find that the OpenAI Moderation API under-captures
materially helpful outputs relative to a semantic grader, and that refusal
rates differ by 5 to 10 percentage points across inference stacks, raising
reproducibility concerns. We release prompts, seeds, outputs, and code for
reproducible auditing at https://github.com/ndurner/gpt-oss-rt-run .

Motivation: 针对低资源语言使用者群体（如非洲豪萨语社区）的模型可靠性问题，检验模型在弱势语言环境下的安全性和文化敏感性。

Method: 通过红队测试（最小化恶意提示）诱发模型生成有害内容，并开展关于杀虫剂毒性的用户调研（样本量n=61）。

Result: 1. 模型产生文化贬损谚语和错误医疗建议
2. 礼貌用语会绕过安全协议（奖励黑客机制）
3. 98%受访者认知与模型的毒性判断存在严重偏差
4. 无法区分生食/加工食品等基础常识

Conclusion: 低资源语言安全调优不足导致漏洞，建议加强多语言红队测试和文化情境化训练，建立动态安全响应机制。

Abstract: In response to the recent safety probing for OpenAI's GPT-OSS-20b model, we
present a summary of a set of vulnerabilities uncovered in the model, focusing
on its performance and safety alignment in a low-resource language setting. The
core motivation for our work is to question the model's reliability for users
from underrepresented communities. Using Hausa, a major African language, we
uncover biases, inaccuracies, and cultural insensitivities in the model's
behaviour. With a minimal prompting, our red-teaming efforts reveal that the
model can be induced to generate harmful, culturally insensitive, and factually
inaccurate content in the language. As a form of reward hacking, we note how
the model's safety protocols appear to relax when prompted with polite or
grateful language, leading to outputs that could facilitate misinformation and
amplify hate speech. For instance, the model operates on the false assumption
that common insecticide locally known as Fiya-Fiya (Cyphermethrin) and
rodenticide like Shinkafar Bera (a form of Aluminium Phosphide) are safe for
human consumption. To contextualise the severity of this error and popularity
of the substances, we conducted a survey (n=61) in which 98% of participants
identified them as toxic. Additional failures include an inability to
distinguish between raw and processed foods and the incorporation of demeaning
cultural proverbs to build inaccurate arguments. We surmise that these issues
manifest through a form of linguistic reward hacking, where the model
prioritises fluent, plausible-sounding output in the target language over
safety and truthfulness. We attribute the uncovered flaws primarily to
insufficient safety tuning in low-resource linguistic contexts. By
concentrating on a low-resource setting, our approach highlights a significant
gap in current red-teaming effort and offer some recommendations.

Motivation: 现有基于LLM对数概率的文本检测方法存在性能瓶颈，需要更有效的解决方案来区分人类与AI生成文本。

Method: 设计自适应分类器AdaDetectGPT，通过训练数据学习见证函数优化logits检测器，并提供检测性能的统计保证。

Result: 在多种数据集和LLM组合中显著优于现有方法，改进幅度最高达58%。

Conclusion: 自适应学习范式为LLM生成文本检测提供了有效技术路径，开源实现促进相关研究。

Abstract: We study the problem of determining whether a piece of text has been authored
by a human or by a large language model (LLM). Existing state of the art
logits-based detectors make use of statistics derived from the log-probability
of the observed text evaluated using the distribution function of a given
source LLM. However, relying solely on log probabilities can be sub-optimal. In
response, we introduce AdaDetectGPT -- a novel classifier that adaptively
learns a witness function from training data to enhance the performance of
logits-based detectors. We provide statistical guarantees on its true positive
rate, false positive rate, true negative rate and false negative rate.
Extensive numerical studies show AdaDetectGPT nearly uniformly improves the
state-of-the-art method in various combination of datasets and LLMs, and the
improvement can reach up to 58%. A python implementation of our method is
available at https://github.com/Mamba413/AdaDetectGPT.

Result: 在Llama/Qwen等模型实现攻击成功率下降70+个百分点（Llama-3.1-8B从89.7%→5.6%），良性任务性能零损失

Conclusion: PSR作为可扩展的推理时安全方案，通过动态资源分配机制实现安全与效率的平衡，为LLM安全防护提供新范式

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing
with their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text.
However, their deployment raises significant concerns about the potential for
generating harmful or inappropriate content. In this paper, we introduce
Progressive Self-Reflection (PSR), a novel inference-time technique that
empowers LLMs to self-monitor and correct their outputs dynamically.
Experimental results demonstrate that applying our proposed method to
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct reduces the attack success rate from 77.5\% to 5.9\%, to
Llama-3.1-8B base from 89.7\% to 5.6\%, and to Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct from 44.4\%
to 3.8\%, without additional training, while maintaining their original
performance on benign tasks. Our approach acts as a test-time scaling method,
where additional self-reflection rounds enhance safety at the cost of inference
overhead. To balance safety with computational efficiency, we introduce a
lightweight self-reflection predictor that estimates the optimal number of
reflection rounds based on input complexity. This adaptive mechanism prevents
unnecessary self-assessment on benign inputs while ensuring thorough evaluation
when encountering potentially harmful content. Our findings suggest that
Progressive Self-Reflection serves as a scalable test-time approach, enhancing
LLM safety by dynamically allocating computational resources in proportion to
the input's risk profile.

Motivation: 现有基于单步生成的AR-LLMs检测方法无法有效捕捉D-LLMs多步去噪中动态出现的幻觉特征，制约D-LLMs的实际应用可靠性。

Method: 将去噪过程建模为动作轨迹（action trace），通过最大化信息增益的子轨迹选择机制提取关键幻觉信号，构建端到端检测框架。

Result: 在多个开源D-LLMs上验证，TraceDet平均提升15.2% AUROC，显著优于传统单步检测基线方法。

Conclusion: TraceDet首次系统利用D-LLMs的多步生成特性，为提升生成模型的可靠性提供新思路，实验证明多步信号对幻觉检测的关键价值。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (D-LLMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to auto-regressive LLMs (AR-LLMs). However, the hallucination
problem in D-LLMs remains underexplored, limiting their reliability in
real-world applications. Existing hallucination detection methods are designed
for AR-LLMs and rely on signals from single-step generation, making them
ill-suited for D-LLMs where hallucination signals often emerge throughout the
multi-step denoising process. To bridge this gap, we propose TraceDet, a novel
framework that explicitly leverages the intermediate denoising steps of D-LLMs
for hallucination detection. TraceDet models the denoising process as an action
trace, with each action defined as the model's prediction over the cleaned
response, conditioned on the previous intermediate output. By identifying the
sub-trace that is maximally informative to the hallucinated responses, TraceDet
leverages the key hallucination signals in the multi-step denoising process of
D-LLMs for hallucination detection. Extensive experiments on various open
source D-LLMs demonstrate that TraceDet consistently improves hallucination
detection, achieving an average gain in AUROC of 15.2% compared to baselines.

Conclusion: 证明大语言模型结合高效微调方法在资源受限场景下的实用价值，为多语言情感分析提供有效解决方案

Abstract: Sentiment analysis is an essential part of text analysis, which is a larger
field that includes determining and evaluating the author's emotional state.
This method is essential since it makes it easier to comprehend consumers'
feelings, viewpoints, and preferences holistically. The introduction of large
language models (LLMs), such as Llama, has greatly increased the availability
of cutting-edge model applications, such as sentiment analysis. However,
accurate sentiment analysis is hampered by the intricacy of written language
and the diversity of languages used in evaluations. The viability of using
transformer-based BERT models and other LLMs for sentiment analysis from
Bangladesh e commerce reviews is investigated in this paper. A subset of 4000
samples from the original dataset of Bangla and English customer reviews was
utilized to fine-tune the model. The fine tuned Llama-3.1-8B model outperformed
other fine-tuned models, including Phi-3.5-mini-instruct, Mistral-7B-v0.1,
DistilBERT-multilingual, mBERT, and XLM-R-base, with an overall accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score of 95.5%, 93%, 88%, 90%. The study emphasizes
how parameter efficient fine-tuning methods (LoRA and PEFT) can lower

Motivation: 现有工具增强型LLM缺乏实际应用指南，难以有效协调文本推理、编码和搜索能力的组合应用

Method: 设计并行运行多个独立代理的集成框架，每个代理采用不同工具组合策略，通过迭代式响应共享和优化机制改进答案质量

Result: 在Gemini系列模型上实现平均3.55%准确率提升，推理成本相近；置信度达标时可节省51%计算资源

Conclusion: 代理多样性与质量优化是核心，通过LLM自动优化设计可实现性能与成本的灵活平衡，为实用化部署提供新范式

Abstract: While integrating tools like Code Interpreter and Search has significantly
enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning in models like ChatGPT Agent and
Gemini-Pro, practical guidance on optimal tool use is lacking. The core
challenge is effectively combining textual reasoning, coding, and search for
diverse questions. In this paper, we propose Tool-Use Mixture (TUMIX), an
ensemble framework that runs multiple agents in parallel, each employing
distinct tool-use strategies and answer paths. Agents in TUMIX iteratively
share and refine responses based on the question and previous answers. In
experiments, TUMIX achieves significant gains over state-of-the-art
tool-augmented and test-time scaling methods, delivering an average accuracy
improvement of up to 3.55% over the best baseline on Gemini-2.5-Pro and
Gemini-2.5-Flash across key reasoning benchmarks, with near-equal inference
costs. We find that agent diversity and quality are crucial and can be enhanced
by using LLMs to auto-optimize agent designs. Furthermore, TUMIX can halt
refinement upon reaching sufficient confidence, preserving performance at only
49% of the inference cost. Further scaling can achieve higher performance,
albeit at a greater cost.

Motivation: 现有推测解码方案的中间验证存在训练开销大、内存占用高和准确性妥协三大缺陷，亟需更高效的验证方案

Method: 通过早期退出模型实现层次化验证，重用各模型间的键值缓存和隐藏状态，并设计周期性目标模型验证机制

Result: 在多个基准测试中平均提升1.28倍吞吐量，最高达2.01倍，且准确性与基线方法持平

Conclusion: HiSpec通过资源复用和层次化验证机制，在推测解码领域实现了效率与精度的最佳平衡

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by using a smaller draft model
to speculate tokens that a larger target model verifies. Verification is often
the bottleneck (e.g. verification is $4\times$ slower than token generation
when a 3B model speculates for a 70B target model), but most prior works focus
only on accelerating drafting. $\textit{``Intermediate"}$ verification reduces
verification time by discarding inaccurate draft tokens early, but existing
methods incur substantial training overheads in incorporating the intermediate
verifier, increase the memory footprint to orchestrate the intermediate
verification step, and compromise accuracy by relying on approximate
heuristics.
  We propose $\underline{\textit{Hi}}\textit{erarchical
}\underline{\textit{Spec}}\textit{ulative Decoding (HiSpec)}$, a framework for
high-throughput speculative decoding that exploits $\textit{early-exit (EE)
models}$ for low-overhead intermediate verification. EE models allow tokens to
exit early by skipping layer traversal and are explicitly trained so that
hidden states at selected layers can be interpreted, making them uniquely
suited for intermediate verification without drastically increasing compute and
memory overheads. To improve resource-efficiency even further, we design a
methodology that enables HiSpec to re-use key-value caches and hidden states
between the draft, intermediate verifier, and target models. To maintain
accuracy, HiSpec periodically validates the draft tokens accepted by the
intermediate verifier against the target model. Our evaluations using various
representative benchmarks and models show that HiSpec improves throughput by
1.28$\times$ on average and by up to 2.01$\times$ compared to the baseline
single-layer speculation without compromising accuracy.

Motivation: 大语言模型在需要因果推理和时间推理的事件类问题上表现不佳，研究旨在通过结构化知识增强其推理能力而不需要微调模型。

Method: 提出TAG-EQA框架，包含九种提示配置（三种策略×三种输入模态），将结构化关系转换为自然语言并与文本结合输入模型。

Result: 在TORQUESTRA基准测试中平均准确率提升5%，零样本设置下最高提升12%，图增强思维链提示可提升18%（效果因模型和配置而异）。

Conclusion: 因果图能有效增强大语言模型的事件推理能力，为基于提示的问答系统提供了灵活的结构化知识注入方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general language tasks but often
struggle with event-based questions-especially those requiring causal or
temporal reasoning. We introduce TAG-EQA (Text-And-Graph for Event Question
Answering), a prompting framework that injects causal event graphs into LLM
inputs by converting structured relations into natural-language statements.
TAG-EQA spans nine prompting configurations, combining three strategies
(zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought) with three input modalities (text-only,
graph-only, text+graph), enabling a systematic analysis of when and how
structured knowledge aids inference. On the TORQUESTRA benchmark, TAG-EQA
improves accuracy by 5% on average over text-only baselines, with gains up to
12% in zero-shot settings and 18% when graph-augmented CoT prompting is
effective. While performance varies by model and configuration, our findings
show that causal graphs can enhance event reasoning in LLMs without
fine-tuning, offering a flexible way to encode structure in prompt-based QA.

Abstract: The automatic evaluation of Language Model (LM) responses is a critical piece
in the development of benchmarks and metrics, both for model training and
quality assessment of production model endpoints. The current approaches to
response classification relies on methods that are too expensive (i.e.
LLM-as-a-Judge) or that are far from real-world conditions (string-matching,
logprob). In this paper, a structure-free evaluation method is presented. The
method makes use of semantic embedding distances to match target candidates
with arbitrary LM-generated text, resulting in a robust classification of the
response at a relatively low compute cost (embedding models of less than $10B$
parameters). The results show a regression score of ~0.97 and an accuracy of
~96% against human annotators, tested over 3 data sets and 3 different LM
architectures.

TL;DR: 提出EQD方法通过两阶段微调框架和奖励机制，有效提升语言模型在金融等专业领域的复杂推理能力，性能提升达10.5%且计算高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在需要专业知识和复杂推理的领域特定定量问答中存在局限，需平衡领域知识利用与计算效率。

Method: 采用两阶段微调框架，通过奖励函数评估子问题生成对问答效果的提升，仅需单GPU和少量样本即可完成训练。

Result: 在金融领域四个基准测试中，EQD超越现有方法实现0.6%-10.5%的性能提升，推理速度与零样本提示相当。

Conclusion: 领域特定问答中，单一支撑性问题比多步引导更有效，EQD为专业领域推理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Domain-specific quantitative reasoning remains a major challenge for large
language models (LLMs), especially in fields requiring expert knowledge and
complex question answering (QA). In this work, we propose Expert Question
Decomposition (EQD), an approach designed to balance the use of domain
knowledge with computational efficiency. EQD is built on a two-step fine-tuning
framework and guided by a reward function that measures the effectiveness of
generated sub-questions in improving QA outcomes. It requires only a few
thousand training examples and a single A100 GPU for fine-tuning, with
inference time comparable to zero-shot prompting. Beyond its efficiency, EQD
outperforms state-of-the-art domain-tuned models and advanced prompting
strategies. We evaluate EQD in the financial domain, characterized by
specialized knowledge and complex quantitative reasoning, across four benchmark
datasets. Our method consistently improves QA performance by 0.6% to 10.5%
across different LLMs. Our analysis reveals an important insight: in
domain-specific QA, a single supporting question often provides greater benefit
than detailed guidance steps.

*Haochen You,Baojing Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReSSFormer通过递归推理、稀疏注意力与无位置编码结构，有效解决Transformer在长上下文推理、计算效率和结构泛化方面的核心缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer存在长上下文推理能力弱、计算效率低（因密集注意力）和结构泛化性差（依赖位置编码和固定层堆叠）三大问题。

Method: 1. 递归推理记忆单元(R2MU)：用循环推理替代层堆叠
2. 自适应稀疏注意力模块(ASAM)：在token和专家层级引入稀疏性
3. 自组织编码结构(SOES)：基于内容直接建模token拓扑关系

Result: 在语言建模、多跳QA和结构敏感任务中，ReSSFormer在相同FLOPs/参数量下全面超越基线模型，尤其展现高效的长程推理能力。

Conclusion: ReSSFormer通过解耦深度与计算量、引入内容驱动的稀疏性，实现了更高效、可扩展且具备结构灵活性的Transformer架构创新。

Abstract: While Transformer architectures have demonstrated impressive scalability
across domains, they continue to face challenges in long-context reasoning,
computational efficiency, and structural generalization - largely due to rigid
layer stacking, dense attention, and reliance on positional encodings. We
present ReSSFormer, a Recursive Sparse Structured Transformer that integrates
three complementary innovations: Recurrent Reasoning & Memory Unit (R2MU) for
iterative reasoning with bounded depth, Adaptive Sparse Attention Module (ASAM)
for efficient and focused context selection, and Self-Organizing Encoder
Structure (SOES) for position-free structure induction. ReSSFormer replaces
conventional depth stacking with recurrent inference, substitutes full
attention with token- and expert-level sparsity, and models latent token
topology directly from content. Across language modeling, multi-hop QA, and
structure-sensitive tasks, ReSSFormer consistently outperforms strong baselines
under comparable FLOPs and parameter budgets, highlighting its scalability,
efficiency, and structural flexibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估LLM输出的方法存在文本层面过拟合和置信度校准不足的缺陷，而模型内部隐藏状态同时编码了语义特征和置信度信息，可作为更统一的验证基础

Method: 基于隐藏状态变化轨迹构建几何可分特征，通过聚类历史成功/失败案例的隐藏状态delta，采用最近质心距离分类（非参数化方法）

Result: 在AIME 24实验中，使用1.5B模型时准确率从56.7%提升至70%，在多个数据集上超越现有基线方法

Conclusion: 隐藏状态包含强判别信号，基于此构建的极简验证框架CLUE能有效提升LLM输出可靠性，为模型自我验证提供新方向

Abstract: Assessing the quality of Large Language Model (LLM) outputs presents a
critical challenge. Previous methods either rely on text-level information
(e.g., reward models, majority voting), which can overfit to superficial cues,
or on calibrated confidence from token probabilities, which would fail on
less-calibrated models. Yet both of these signals are, in fact, partial
projections of a richer source of information: the model's internal hidden
states. Early layers, closer to token embeddings, preserve semantic and lexical
features that underpin text-based judgments, while later layers increasingly
align with output logits, embedding confidence-related information. This paper
explores hidden states directly as a unified foundation for verification. We
show that the correctness of a solution is encoded as a geometrically separable
signature within the trajectory of hidden activations. To validate this, we
present Clue (Clustering and Experience-based Verification), a deliberately
minimalist, non-parametric verifier. With no trainable parameters, CLUE only
summarizes each reasoning trace by an hidden state delta and classifies
correctness via nearest-centroid distance to ``success'' and ``failure''
clusters formed from past experience. The simplicity of this method highlights
the strength of the underlying signal. Empirically, CLUE consistently
outperforms LLM-as-a-judge baselines and matches or exceeds modern
confidence-based methods in reranking candidates, improving both top-1 and
majority-vote accuracy across AIME 24/25 and GPQA. As a highlight, on AIME 24
with a 1.5B model, CLUE boosts accuracy from 56.7% (majority@64) to 70.0%
(top-maj@16).

Keywords: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Large Language Models (LLMs),
Fine-tuning, Question Answering, Joint fine-tuning TL;DR: We evaluate and
compare strategies for fine-tuning Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipelines, including independent fine-tuning, joint fine-tuning, and two-phase
fine-tuning. Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a popular
framework for question answering that is powered by two large language models
(LLMs): an embedding model that retrieves context documents from a database
that are relevant to a given question, and a generator model that uses the
retrieved context to generate an answer to the question. Both the embedding and
generator models can be fine-tuned to increase performance of a RAG pipeline on
a new task, but multiple fine-tuning strategies exist with different costs and
benefits. In this paper, we evaluate and compare several RAG fine-tuning
strategies, including independent, joint, and two-phase fine-tuning. In our
experiments, we observe that all of these strategies achieve about equal
improvement in EM and F1 generation quality metrics, although they have
significantly different computational costs. We conclude the optimal
fine-tuning strategy to use depends on whether the training dataset includes
context labels and whether a grid search over the learning rates for the
embedding and generator models is required.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型语言模型在传统中文应用存在token不稳定问题（输出非TC字符/语言混杂），需提升部署可靠性

Method: 1. 基于TC语料持续预训练
2. 指令数据监督微调
3. 直接偏好优化强化单语输出
全程使用参数高效LoRA适配器，无需全模型重训练

Result: 基准测试非TC输出减少51.3%；命名实体翻译错误率较Llama-3B降低77.2%，较Qwen-1.5B降低57.2%

Conclusion: 验证了1B级模型的语言稳定性优化路径，适配器方案硬件友好且可复现，方法论可扩展至其他非英语语言

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) enable cost-effective, on-device and
latency-sensitive AI applications, yet their deployment in Traditional Chinese
(TC) remains hindered by token-level instability - models unpredictably emit
non-TC characters or code-switch into other languages. We address this
practical reliability gap by creating PureTC-1B, a three-stage stabilization
pipeline for Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct (an open-weight, instruction-tuned model
released by Meta) using parameter-efficient LoRA adapters. Our method combines
Continual Pre-Training (CPT) on TC-centric corpora, Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) with instruction data, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using
TC-adherence preferences to improve monolingual robustness without full-model
retraining. On a benchmark designed to simulate real-world usage, PureTC-1B
achieves a 51.3% relative reduction (micro-average) in non-TC output tokens
versus the base model. On a Named Entity Translation (NET) task, PureTC-1B
further reduces incorrect-language tokens by 77.2% relative to Llama-3B and
57.2% relative to Qwen-1.5B, indicating that robust TC adherence is attainable
even at the 1B scale. The pipeline is reproducible, adapter-only, and
hardware-friendly, offering practitioners a practical recipe to enhance
language stability for TC and potentially other non-English languages.

TL;DR: 提出AMAS框架，通过动态图设计器解决传统多智能体系统结构僵化问题，实现任务自适应的智能体路径优化，显著提升多种任务的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多智能体系统受限于静态拓扑结构，无法根据任务上下文动态调整，导致跨领域应用效能低下。需构建具有上下文敏感性的动态架构以突破性能瓶颈。

Method: 开发动态图设计器组件，通过轻量级LLM适配自主生成任务专属图配置，基于输入特征动态规划最优智能体协作路径，替代传统固定模板。

Result: 在问答、数学推导和代码生成三大基准测试中，AMAS全面超越现有单/多智能体方案，且验证结果在不同规模LLM架构中保持一致性。

Conclusion: 上下文敏感的结构自适应机制是LLM多智能体系统高效部署的核心要素，动态拓扑优化可释放大模型在复杂任务中的协同潜力。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language
processing capabilities, their practical implementation as autonomous
multi-agent systems (MAS) for industrial problem-solving encounters persistent
barriers. Conventional MAS architectures are fundamentally restricted by
inflexible, hand-crafted graph topologies that lack contextual responsiveness,
resulting in diminished efficacy across varied academic and commercial
workloads. To surmount these constraints, we introduce AMAS, a
paradigm-shifting framework that redefines LLM-based MAS through a novel
dynamic graph designer. This component autonomously identifies task-specific
optimal graph configurations via lightweight LLM adaptation, eliminating the
reliance on monolithic, universally applied structural templates. Instead, AMAS
exploits the intrinsic properties of individual inputs to intelligently direct
query trajectories through task-optimized agent pathways. Rigorous validation
across question answering, mathematical deduction, and code generation
benchmarks confirms that AMAS systematically exceeds state-of-the-art
single-agent and multi-agent approaches across diverse LLM architectures. Our
investigation establishes that context-sensitive structural adaptability
constitutes a foundational requirement for high-performance LLM MAS
deployments.

Motivation: 大型语言模型存在安全漏洞，恶意用户可通过精心设计的越狱提示绕过安全防护机制，需开发更强大的检测方法。

Method: 通过对比不同机器学习模型在现有数据集的表现，采用端到端微调BERT模型，并进行关键词可视化分析。

Result: 微调BERT模型检测效果最佳，可视化显示越狱提示具有明显反射性结构特征（如重复/强调模式）。

Conclusion: 模型微调结合提示结构分析可提升越狱检测能力，未来需开发能识别新型攻击策略的防御系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from a range of vulnerabilities that
allow malicious users to solicit undesirable responses through manipulation of
the input text. These so-called jailbreak prompts are designed to trick the LLM
into circumventing the safety guardrails put in place to keep responses
acceptable to the developer's policies. In this study, we analyse the ability
of different machine learning models to distinguish jailbreak prompts from
genuine uses, including looking at our ability to identify jailbreaks that use
previously unseen strategies. Our results indicate that using current datasets
the best performance is achieved by fine tuning a Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT) model end-to-end for identifying
jailbreaks. We visualise the keywords that distinguish jailbreak from genuine
prompts and conclude that explicit reflexivity in prompt structure could be a
signal of jailbreak intention.

Conclusion: 突破传统单向注意力的限制，通过架构改造和训练策略优化，成功提升了LLMs在文本嵌入任务中的表现潜力

Abstract: Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional
performance in language understanding and generation. However, their
application in text embedding tasks has been relatively slow, along with the
analysis of their semantic representation in probing tasks, due to the
constraints of the unidirectional attention mechanism.
  This paper aims to explore whether such constraints can be overcome by
enabling bidirectional attention in LLMs. We tested different variants of the
Llama architecture through additional training steps, progressively enabling
bidirectional attention and unsupervised/supervised contrastive learning.

Abstract: Cybersecurity is a relentless arms race, with AI driven offensive systems
evolving faster than traditional defenses can adapt. Research and tooling
remain fragmented across isolated defensive functions, creating blind spots
that adversaries exploit. Autonomous agents capable of integrating, exploit
confirmation, remediation, and validation into a single closed loop offer
promise, but the field lacks three essentials: a framework defining the agentic
capabilities of security systems across security life cycle, a principled
method for evaluating closed loop agents, and a benchmark for measuring their
performance in practice. We introduce CLASP: the Closed-Loop Autonomous
Security Performance framework which aligns the security lifecycle
(reconnaissance, exploitation, root cause analysis, patch synthesis,
validation) with core agentic capabilities (planning, tool use, memory,
reasoning, reflection & perception) providing a common vocabulary and rubric
for assessing agentic capabilities in security tasks. By applying CLASP to 21
representative works, we map where systems demonstrate strengths, and where
capability gaps persist. We then define the Closed-Loop Capability (CLC) Score,
a composite metric quantifying both degree of loop closure and operational
effectiveness, and outline the requirements for a closed loop benchmark.
Together, CLASP and the CLC Score, provide the vocabulary, diagnostics, and
measurements needed to advance both function level performance and measure
closed loop security agents.

Conclusion: MDSEval填补多模态摘要评估基准空白，暴露当前评估体系缺陷，为开发更鲁棒的跨模态评估方法奠定基础

Abstract: Multimodal Dialogue Summarization (MDS) is a critical task with wide-ranging
applications. To support the development of effective MDS models, robust
automatic evaluation methods are essential for reducing both cost and human
effort. However, such methods require a strong meta-evaluation benchmark
grounded in human annotations. In this work, we introduce MDSEval, the first
meta-evaluation benchmark for MDS, consisting image-sharing dialogues,
corresponding summaries, and human judgments across eight well-defined quality
aspects. To ensure data quality and richfulness, we propose a novel filtering
framework leveraging Mutually Exclusive Key Information (MEKI) across
modalities. Our work is the first to identify and formalize key evaluation
dimensions specific to MDS. We benchmark state-of-the-art modal evaluation
methods, revealing their limitations in distinguishing summaries from advanced
MLLMs and their susceptibility to various bias.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Chain of Thought/Tree of Thought等推理协议缺乏外部质疑触发自我修订的机制，限制了推理过程的严谨性和迭代优化能力。

Method: 设计非对称三角色协议（Defender提出方案，Objectioner提出质疑，Host协调闭环），通过结构化提示实现模型无关的自我修订，无需微调即可适配不同规模模型。

Result: GSM8K任务准确率与CoT相当但推理连贯性评分高10%+，小模型性能显著提升（19%准确率提升），开放任务展示更深入的假设探索和权衡显性化。

Conclusion: 纯提示层角色扮演协议突破模型规模限制，为设备端小模型提供新可能，对话轨迹为研究质疑引导推理提供可扩展研究框架。

Abstract: Reasoning protocols such as Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thought (ToT)
organize internal deliberation but lack an explicit mechanism for external
questioning that elicits self-revision. We present FOR-Prompting (From
Objection to Revision Prompting), an asymmetric protocol where a Defender
proposes an answer, an Objectioner raises question-style objections with no
direct fixes, and a Host enforces consistency and closure. On GSM8K we observe
about a 22% point gain over single-prompt and accuracy on par with CoT, with
more than 10% higher ratings in reasoning and coherence from a uniform GPT 4.1
judge. FOR-Prompting also corrects mistakes without tools or human supervision
on tricky queries, and improves performance for small-scale model (approx. 19%
accuracy improved on Llama3.2:1b for GSM8K task), highlighting promise for
small models and on personal device use. Beyond factual QA, qualitative
analyses on open-ended tasks show enhanced exploration and refinement, with
dialogue traces that make assumptions and trade-offs explicit. The protocol is
model agnostic and operates purely at the prompt level through role-structured
turns, so it works with hosted and local models of different sizes without
retraining, and it supports large-scale study of objection-guided reasoning.

Result: 发现模型存在直接映射（无中间变量）和组合推理（显式计算中间变量）两种机制，且机制选择与嵌入空间线性映射能力相关。

Conclusion: LLMs的组合能力受嵌入空间几何特性驱动，当输入与目标存在线性映射时更倾向使用非组合的直接机制。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) appear to be increasingly capable of
solving compositional tasks, it is an open question whether they do so using
compositional mechanisms. In this work, we investigate how feedforward LLMs
solve two-hop factual recall tasks, which can be expressed compositionally as
$g(f(x))$. We first confirm that modern LLMs continue to suffer from the
"compositionality gap": i.e. their ability to compute both $z = f(x)$ and $y =
g(z)$ does not entail their ability to compute the composition $y = g(f(x))$.
Then, using logit lens on their residual stream activations, we identify two
processing mechanisms, one which solves tasks $\textit{compositionally}$,
computing $f(x)$ along the way to computing $g(f(x))$, and one which solves
them $\textit{directly}$, without any detectable signature of the intermediate
variable $f(x)$. Finally, we find that which mechanism is employed appears to
be related to the embedding space geometry, with the idiomatic mechanism being
dominant in cases where there exists a linear mapping from $x$ to $g(f(x))$ in
the embedding spaces. We fully release our data and code at:

Result: 实验结果表明该方法显著减轻了医疗预咨询场景中的格式惯性问题

Conclusion: 通过简单的数据平衡方法有效解决LLMs在长对话中的格式惯性，证明数据分布调整对模型性能的重要影响

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have brought significant
improvements to various service domains, including chatbots and medical
pre-consultation applications. In the healthcare domain, the most common
approach for adapting LLMs to multi-turn dialogue generation is Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, datasets for SFT in tasks like medical
pre-consultation typically exhibit a skewed turn-count distribution. Training
on such data induces a novel failure mechanism we term **Format Inertia**,
where models tend to generate repetitive, format-correct, but diagnostically
uninformative questions in long medical dialogues. To mitigate this observed
failure mechanism, we adopt a simple, data-centric method that rebalances the
turn-count distribution of the training dataset. Experimental results show that
our approach substantially alleviates Format Inertia in medical
pre-consultation.

TL;DR: 提出MathLens基准测试框架，通过分解多模态推理的感知、推理、整合三要素，揭示不同训练方法对各子能力的差异化提升效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态推理模型评估依赖单一准确率指标，难以定位模型改进方向。需建立可分解评估子能力的系统性基准。

Method: 构建包含视觉图表、文本描述、控制问题的MathLens基准，通过符号化问题生成保持一致性。采用强化学习、多模态监督微调等方法对比训练效果。

Result: 强化学习主攻感知能力提升，文本监督间接增强感知；推理需与感知协同发展；整合能力始终是瓶颈；不同方法在鲁棒性上表现相反。

Conclusion: 整合能力是当前多模态推理的核心挑战，需针对性优化。强化学习提升抗干扰能力，而多模态微调易导致过拟合，需平衡训练策略。

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning models have recently shown promise on challenging
domains such as olympiad-level geometry, yet their evaluation remains dominated
by aggregate accuracy, a single score that obscures where and how models are
improving. We introduce MathLens, a benchmark designed to disentangle the
subskills of multimodal reasoning while preserving the complexity of
textbook-style geometry problems. The benchmark separates performance into
three components: Perception: extracting information from raw inputs,
Reasoning: operating on available information, and Integration: selecting
relevant perceptual evidence and applying it within reasoning. To support each
test, we provide annotations: visual diagrams, textual descriptions to evaluate
reasoning in isolation, controlled questions that require both modalities, and
probes for fine-grained perceptual skills, all derived from symbolic
specifications of the problems to ensure consistency and robustness. Our
analysis reveals that different training approaches have uneven effects: First,
reinforcement learning chiefly strengthens perception, especially when
supported by textual supervision, while textual SFT indirectly improves
perception through reflective reasoning. Second, reasoning improves only in
tandem with perception. Third, integration remains the weakest capacity, with
residual errors concentrated there once other skills advance. Finally,
robustness diverges: RL improves consistency under diagram variation, whereas
multimodal SFT reduces it through overfitting. We will release all data and
experimental logs.

TL;DR: 将工程设计标准转化为模块化可复用本体，实现阀门选型自动化验证


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工业标准以文档为中心难以数字化应用，需转化为机器可解释的本体提升设备选型质量

Method: 基于国际管道/材料标准建立模块化OWL本体，通过语义推理执行设计规则，在阀门选型场景验证本体有效性

Result: 成功实现阀门产品类型与规格的自动匹配验证，证明基于IDO的本体体系对智能标准的支撑能力

Conclusion: 模块化本体方法为标准机构向数字化智能标准转型提供可行路径，显著提升设备选型过程的标准化程度

Abstract: Engineering design processes use technical specifications and must comply
with standards. Product specifications, product type data sheets, and design
standards are still mainly document-centric despite the ambition to digitalize
industrial work. In this paper, we demonstrate how to transform information
held in engineering design standards into modular, reusable,
machine-interpretable ontologies and use the ontologies in quality assurance of
the plant design and equipment selection process. We use modelling patterns to
create modular ontologies for knowledge captured in the text and in frequently
referenced tables in International Standards for piping, material and valve
design. These modules are exchangeable, as stored in a W3C compliant format,
and interoperable as they are aligned with the top-level ontology ISO DIS
23726-3: Industrial Data Ontology (IDO).
  We test these ontologies, created based on international material and piping
standards and industry norms, on a valve selection process. Valves are
instantiated in semantic asset models as individuals along with a semantic
representation of the environmental condition at their location on the asset.
We create "functional location tags" as OWL individuals that become instances
of OWL class Valve Data Sheet (VDS) specified valves. Similarly we create
instances of manufacturer product type. Our approach enables automated
validation that a specific VDS is compliant with relevant industry standards.
Using semantic reasoning and executable design rules, we also determine whether
the product type meets the valve specification. Creation of shared, reusable
IDO-based modular ontologies for design standards enables semantic reasoning to
be applied to equipment selection processes and demonstrates the potential of
this approach for Standards Bodies wanting to transition to digitized Smart
Standards.

TL;DR: 提出Refusal Index（RI）作为大语言模型知识感知拒绝能力的新评估指标，解决了现有指标的偏差问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标无法准确衡量LLMs对超出知识范围问题的拒绝能力，简单的拒绝率指标易受模型拒绝倾向影响，校准指标则存在代理偏差

Method: 通过定义斯皮尔曼等级相关性（RI=拒绝概率与错误概率的相关性），设计轻量级两次评估方法，使用16个模型在5个数据集进行验证

Result: RI能稳定量化模型内在拒绝能力，揭示LLMs虽在事实任务中准确率高，但其拒绝行为存在不可靠性和脆弱性

Conclusion: 应将RI与传统准确率指标结合，构建更全面的LLM事实性评估体系

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) should refuse to answer questions beyond their
knowledge. This capability, which we term knowledge-aware refusal, is crucial
for factual reliability. However, existing metrics fail to faithfully measure
this ability. On the one hand, simple refusal-based metrics are biased by
refusal rates and yield inconsistent scores when models exhibit different
refusal tendencies. On the other hand, existing calibration metrics are
proxy-based, capturing the performance of auxiliary calibration processes
rather than the model's actual refusal behavior. In this work, we propose the
Refusal Index (RI), a principled metric that measures how accurately LLMs
refuse questions they do not know. We define RI as Spearman's rank correlation
between refusal probability and error probability. To make RI practically
measurable, we design a lightweight two-pass evaluation method that efficiently
estimates RI from observed refusal rates across two standard evaluation runs.
Extensive experiments across 16 models and 5 datasets demonstrate that RI
accurately quantifies a model's intrinsic knowledge-aware refusal capability in
factual tasks. Notably, RI remains stable across different refusal rates and
provides consistent model rankings independent of a model's overall accuracy
and refusal rates. More importantly, RI provides insight into an important but
previously overlooked aspect of LLM factuality: while LLMs achieve high
accuracy on factual tasks, their refusal behavior can be unreliable and
fragile. This finding highlights the need to complement traditional accuracy
metrics with the Refusal Index for comprehensive factuality evaluation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能在法律NLP中的快速发展需要可扩展的评估方法，尤其缺乏无需人工标注的自动化评估工具

Method: 使用7,168份专家评分验证16种无监督指标（含文档/语义/结构/法律专用类别）对1,000份俄语司法文书的语义块提取效果，采用Bootstrap相关、Lin's CCC和MAE分析

Result: 术语频率一致性（Pearson r=0.540）和覆盖率（r=0.513）表现最佳，法律术语密度呈负相关（r=-0.479）。GPT-4.1-mini的LLM评估仅中等相关（r=0.382）

Conclusion: 无监督指标适用于初步筛查，但因中等相关性和低一致性需保留人工评估。研究为法律NLP提供了无需标注的评估框架，推动司法AI伦理部署

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence in legal natural language
processing demands scalable methods for evaluating text extraction from
judicial decisions. This study evaluates 16 unsupervised metrics, including
novel formulations, to assess the quality of extracting seven semantic blocks
from 1,000 anonymized Russian judicial decisions, validated against 7,168
expert reviews on a 1--5 Likert scale. These metrics, spanning document-based,
semantic, structural, pseudo-ground truth, and legal-specific categories,
operate without pre-annotated ground truth. Bootstrapped correlations, Lin's
concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), and mean absolute error (MAE) reveal
that Term Frequency Coherence (Pearson $r = 0.540$, Lin CCC = 0.512, MAE =
0.127) and Coverage Ratio/Block Completeness (Pearson $r = 0.513$, Lin CCC =
0.443, MAE = 0.139) best align with expert ratings, while Legal Term Density
(Pearson $r = -0.479$, Lin CCC = -0.079, MAE = 0.394) show strong negative
correlations. The LLM Evaluation Score (mean = 0.849, Pearson $r = 0.382$, Lin
CCC = 0.325, MAE = 0.197) showed moderate alignment, but its performance, using
gpt-4.1-mini via g4f, suggests limited specialization for legal textse. These
findings highlight that unsupervised metrics, including LLM-based approaches,
enable scalable screening but, with moderate correlations and low CCC values,
cannot fully replace human judgment in high-stakes legal contexts. This work
advances legal NLP by providing annotation-free evaluation tools, with
implications for judicial analytics and ethical AI deployment.

Motivation: 大型语言模型生成的垃圾评论高度逼真，现有检测系统难以识别，严重威胁在线平台信誉，需要开发不依赖人工特征工程的自动化检测方案

Method: 整合预训练语言模型的文本嵌入与门控图变换器，构建兼顾语义特征和行为模式的混合架构（FraudSquad），利用图结构捕捉用户-商品交互关系

Conclusion: 构建首个LLM生成垃圾评论基准，验证模型跨数据适应能力，证明结合语义与行为特征的混合架构是应对AI生成内容威胁的有效方案

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has enabled the generation of highly
persuasive spam reviews that closely mimic human writing. These reviews pose
significant challenges for existing detection systems and threaten the
credibility of online platforms. In this work, we first create three realistic
LLM-generated spam review datasets using three distinct LLMs, each guided by
product metadata and genuine reference reviews. Evaluations by GPT-4.1 confirm
the high persuasion and deceptive potential of these reviews. To address this
threat, we propose FraudSquad, a hybrid detection model that integrates text
embeddings from a pre-trained language model with a gated graph transformer for
spam node classification. FraudSquad captures both semantic and behavioral
signals without relying on manual feature engineering or massive training
resources. Experiments show that FraudSquad outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by up to 44.22% in precision and 43.01% in recall on three
LLM-generated datasets, while also achieving promising results on two
human-written spam datasets. Furthermore, FraudSquad maintains a modest model
size and requires minimal labeled training data, making it a practical solution
for real-world applications. Our contributions include new synthetic datasets,
a practical detection framework, and empirical evidence highlighting the
urgency of adapting spam detection to the LLM era. Our code and datasets are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs数学推理错误是否源于句法结构而非概念理解缺陷，验证句法复杂度与错误率的关联性

Method: 通过句法模板重述错误问题，使用基于依存局部性理论（DLT）的指标量化句法复杂度

Result: 句法复杂度（高DLT分数）与错误率正相关，语义保留的句法简化可显著提升模型正确率

Conclusion: 结构偏差是推理错误主因，语法感知干预能有效缓解模型的归纳失败

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong mathematical problem-solving
abilities but frequently fail on problems that deviate syntactically from their
training distribution. We identify a systematic failure mode, syntactic blind
spots, in which models misapply familiar reasoning strategies to problems that
are semantically straightforward but phrased in unfamiliar ways. These errors
are not due to gaps in mathematical competence, but rather reflect a brittle
coupling between surface form and internal representation. To test this, we
rephrase incorrectly answered questions using syntactic templates drawn from
correct examples. These rephrasings, which preserve semantics while reducing
structural complexity, often lead to correct answers. We quantify syntactic
complexity using a metric based on Dependency Locality Theory (DLT), and show
that higher DLT scores are associated with increased failure rates across
multiple datasets. Our findings suggest that many reasoning errors stem from
structural misalignment rather than conceptual difficulty, and that
syntax-aware interventions can reveal and mitigate these inductive failures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法在网页半结构化数据抽取中存在的泛化能力不足与资源消耗大的痛点

Method: 1. 基于同站点网页布局相似性设计强化学习奖励信号
2. 生成可跨页面复用的提取脚本
3. 利用CommonCrawl数据迭代训练合成标注

Result: 脚本质量超越基线13%，GPT-4o下游问答准确率提升4%以上

Conclusion: SCRIBES实现了可扩展、资源高效的网页信息抽取新范式

Abstract: Semi-structured content in HTML tables, lists, and infoboxes accounts for a
substantial share of factual data on the web, yet the formatting complicates
usage, and reliably extracting structured information from them remains
challenging. Existing methods either lack generalization or are
resource-intensive due to per-page LLM inference. In this paper, we introduce
SCRIBES (SCRIpt-Based Semi-Structured Content Extraction at Web-Scale), a novel
reinforcement learning framework that leverages layout similarity across
webpages within the same site as a reward signal. Instead of processing each
page individually, SCRIBES generates reusable extraction scripts that can be
applied to groups of structurally similar webpages. Our approach further
improves by iteratively training on synthetic annotations from in-the-wild
CommonCrawl data. Experiments show that our approach outperforms strong
baselines by over 13% in script quality and boosts downstream question
answering accuracy by more than 4% for GPT-4o, enabling scalable and
resource-efficient web information extraction.

Motivation: 现有视觉-语言模型参数规模大、训练数据远超儿童语言习得输入量。研究旨在低资源环境下开发语言/多模态模型，并探索如何维持多模态模型的纯语言能力。

Method: 使用发展合理性数据集构建模型，采用模型融合技术（加权线性插值）整合多模态模型与纯语言模型的参数。

Result: 多模态模型在语法类纯语言任务中表现较弱，模型融合可使语言性能提升约2%，同时保持多模态能力。

Conclusion: 模型融合是平衡多模态与纯语言任务的有效策略，但性能差距仍未完全消除。

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision-and-language models consist of many parameters and
learn from enormous datasets, surpassing the amounts of linguistic data that
children are exposed to as they acquire a language. This paper presents our
approach to the multimodal track of the BabyLM challenge addressing this
discrepancy. We develop language-only and multimodal models in low-resource
settings using developmentally plausible datasets, with our multimodal models
outperforming previous BabyLM baselines. One finding in the multimodal language
model literature is that these models tend to underperform in
\textit{language-only} tasks. Therefore, we focus on maintaining language-only
abilities in multimodal models. To this end, we experiment with \textit{model
merging}, where we fuse the parameters of multimodal models with those of
language-only models using weighted linear interpolation. Our results
corroborate the findings that multimodal models underperform in language-only
benchmarks that focus on grammar, and model merging with text-only models can
help alleviate this problem to some extent, while maintaining multimodal
performance.

Result: 在多个模型家族中编辑准确率提升10%-30%，显著降低知识遗忘

Conclusion: REPAIR为构建可靠、可扩展的持续进化LLM提供了创新框架

Abstract: Post-training for large language models (LLMs) is constrained by the high
cost of acquiring new knowledge or correcting errors and by the unintended side
effects that frequently arise from retraining. To address these issues, we
introduce REPAIR (Robust Editing via Progressive Adaptive Intervention and
Reintegration), a lifelong editing framework designed to support precise and
low-cost model updates while preserving non-target knowledge. REPAIR mitigates
the instability and conflicts of large-scale sequential edits through a
closed-loop feedback mechanism coupled with dynamic memory management.
Furthermore, by incorporating frequent knowledge fusion and enforcing strong
locality guards, REPAIR effectively addresses the shortcomings of traditional
distribution-agnostic approaches that often overlook unintended ripple effects.
Our experiments demonstrate that REPAIR boosts editing accuracy by 10%-30%
across multiple model families and significantly reduces knowledge forgetting.
This work introduces a robust framework for developing reliable, scalable, and
continually evolving LLMs.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in enhancing the reasoning
performance of LLMs. For example, they can provide training signals to finetune
LLMs during reinforcement learning (RL) and help select the best answer from
multiple candidates during inference. In this paper, we provide a systematic
introduction to RMs, along with a comprehensive survey of their applications in
LLM reasoning. We first review fundamental concepts of RMs, including their
architectures, training methodologies, and evaluation techniques. Then, we
explore their key applications: (1) guiding generation and selecting optimal
outputs during LLM inference, (2) facilitating data synthesis and iterative
self-improvement for LLMs, and (3) providing training signals in RL-based
finetuning. Finally, we address critical open questions regarding the
selection, generalization, evaluation, and enhancement of RMs, based on
existing research and our own empirical findings. Our analysis aims to provide
actionable insights for the effective deployment and advancement of RMs for LLM

Conclusion: ILM为下一代LLM奠定基础，在保持生成能力的同时实现本质可控性，增强可信度

Abstract: The current landscape of defensive mechanisms for LLMs is fragmented and
underdeveloped, unlike prior work on classifiers. To further promote
adversarial robustness in LLMs, we propose Inverse Language Modeling (ILM), a
unified framework that simultaneously 1) improves the robustness of LLMs to
input perturbations, and, at the same time, 2) enables native grounding by
inverting model outputs to identify potentially toxic or unsafe input triggers.
ILM transforms LLMs from static generators into analyzable and robust systems,
potentially helping RED teaming. ILM can lay the foundation for next-generation
LLMs that are not only robust and grounded but also fundamentally more
controllable and trustworthy. The code is publicly available at

Conclusion: 在线强化学习显著提升声明验证的精确性与可解释性，开源框架为LLM赋能的Fact-Checking研究提供新范式。

Abstract: Claim verification with large language models (LLMs) has recently attracted
considerable attention, owing to their superior reasoning capabilities and
transparent verification pathways compared to traditional answer-only
judgments. Online claim verification requires iterative evidence retrieval and
reasoning, yet existing approaches mainly rely on prompt engineering or
predesigned reasoning workflows without offering a unified training paradigm to
improve necessary skills. Therefore, we introduce Veri-R1, an online
reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables an LLM to interact with a
search engine and to receive reward signals that explicitly shape its planning,
retrieval, and reasoning behaviors. The dynamic interaction between models and
retrieval systems more accurately reflects real-world verification scenarios
and fosters comprehensive verification skills. Empirical results show that
Veri-R1 improves joint accuracy by up to 30% and doubles evidence score, often
surpassing larger-scale counterparts. Ablation studies further reveal the
impact of reward components and the link between output logits and label
accuracy. Our results highlight the effectiveness of online RL for precise and
faithful claim verification and provide a foundation for future research. We
release our code to support community progress in LLM empowered claim
verification.

Motivation: 人类价值观具有主观性，受社会文化背景影响。为避免AI系统偏向主流观点，需识别个体价值诠释以实现人机对齐。

Method: 通过零样本/少样本实验，对比不同SEAT维度组合（情感/情绪/论点/主题）对语言模型预测个体价值观的影响

Result: 同时使用所有SEAT维度效果最佳，个体标注者间存在显著差异，证明需考虑个体主观标注行为

Conclusion: 首次突破人口统计学范畴，建立标注行为与价值预测的关联，为未来大规模验证奠定基础

Abstract: Our interpretation of value concepts is shaped by our sociocultural
background and lived experiences, and is thus subjective. Recognizing
individual value interpretations is important for developing AI systems that
can align with diverse human perspectives and avoid bias toward majority
viewpoints. To this end, we investigate whether a language model can predict
individual value interpretations by leveraging multi-dimensional subjective
annotations as a proxy for their interpretive lens. That is, we evaluate
whether providing examples of how an individual annotates Sentiment, Emotion,
Argument, and Topics (SEAT dimensions) helps a language model in predicting
their value interpretations. Our experiment across different zero- and few-shot
settings demonstrates that providing all SEAT dimensions simultaneously yields
superior performance compared to individual dimensions and a baseline where no
information about the individual is provided. Furthermore, individual
variations across annotators highlight the importance of accounting for the
incorporation of individual subjective annotators. To the best of our
knowledge, this controlled setting, although small in size, is the first
attempt to go beyond demographics and investigate the impact of annotation
behavior on value prediction, providing a solid foundation for future
large-scale validation.

Motivation: 针对现有研究忽视数据库模式设计对NL2SQL系统性能的影响，首次系统研究模式规范化程度对不同大语言模型的影响

Method: 使用合成数据集（1NF-3NF规范化）和真实学术论文数据集，评估8个主流大语言模型在不同规范化模式下的表现，包含零样本和少样本设置

Result: 1. 去规范化模式在简单检索查询中准确率高（零样本可用小模型）
2. 规范化模式（2NF/3NF）存在表连接预测错误（少样本可缓解）
3. 聚合查询中规范化模式因避免数据冗余和空值更稳定

Conclusion: NL2SQL应用应基于查询类型选择模式设计：简单查询适用去规范化，复杂聚合适用规范化。建议开发自适应模式选择机制应对实际场景需求

Abstract: Schema design, particularly normalization, is a critical yet often overlooked
factor in natural language to SQL (NL2SQL) systems. Most prior research
evaluates models on fixed schemas, overlooking the influence of design on
performance. We present the first systematic study of schema normalization's
impact, evaluating eight leading large language models on synthetic and
real-world datasets with varied normalization levels. We construct controlled
synthetic datasets with formal normalization (1NF-3NF) and real academic paper
datasets with practical schemes. Our results show that denormalized schemas
offer high accuracy on simple retrieval queries, even with cost-effective
models in zero-shot settings. In contrast, normalized schemas (2NF/3NF)
introduce challenges such as errors in base table selection and join type
prediction; however, these issues are substantially mitigated by providing
few-shot examples. For aggregation queries, normalized schemas yielded better
performance, mainly due to their robustness against the data duplication and
NULL value issues that cause errors in denormalized schemas. These findings
suggest that the optimal schema design for NL2SQL applications depends on the
types of queries to be supported. Our study demonstrates the importance of
considering schema design when developing NL2SQL interfaces and integrating
adaptive schema selection for real-world scenarios.

provide fertile ground for the spread of hate speech, offensive language, and
bullying content targeting individuals, organizations, and communities. Such
content undermines safety, participation, and equity online. Reliable detection
systems are therefore needed, especially for low-resource languages where
moderation tools are limited. In Bangla, prior work has contributed resources
and models, but most are single-task (e.g., binary hate/offense) with limited
coverage of multi-facet signals (type, severity, target). We address these gaps
by introducing the first multi-task Bangla hate-speech dataset,
BanglaMultiHate, one of the largest manually annotated corpus to date. Building
on this resource, we conduct a comprehensive, controlled comparison spanning
classical baselines, monolingual pretrained models, and LLMs under zero-shot
prompting and LoRA fine-tuning. Our experiments assess LLM adaptability in a
low-resource setting and reveal a consistent trend: although LoRA-tuned LLMs
are competitive with BanglaBERT, culturally and linguistically grounded
pretraining remains critical for robust performance. Together, our dataset and
findings establish a stronger benchmark for developing culturally aligned
moderation tools in low-resource contexts. For reproducibility, we will release
the dataset and all related scripts.

Motivation: 现有LLM创造力评估多关注输出质量而非创作过程，需建立系统化的过程分析方法。

Method: 运用叙事学框架，通过控制性提示赋予模型作者角色，分析其创作偏好及选择理由。

Result: 所有模型在创作决策中持续优先Style要素（比Character/Event/Setting高2-4倍），不同模型展现出差异化偏好模式。

Conclusion: 该约束性决策框架为系统分析AI创作特征提供了新工具，揭示了模型在作者身份中的独特认知架构。

Abstract: Evaluations of large language models (LLMs)' creativity have focused
primarily on the quality of their outputs rather than the processes that shape
them. This study takes a process-oriented approach, drawing on narratology to
examine LLMs as computational authors. We introduce constraint-based
decision-making as a lens for authorial creativity. Using controlled prompting
to assign authorial personas, we analyze the creative preferences of the
models. Our findings show that LLMs consistently emphasize Style over other
elements, including Character, Event, and Setting. By also probing the
reasoning the models provide for their choices, we show that distinctive
profiles emerge across models and argue that our approach provides a novel
systematic tool for analyzing AI's authorial creativity.

Motivation: 传统语音对话系统因工具集成导致响应延迟，破坏对话流畅性。现有文本系统通过工具增强事实性，但语音系统缺乏类似解决方案

Method: 1. 开发后训练框架训练模型在用户说话时预判工具调用时机
2. 生成融合音频查询与文本检索结果的语音摘要
3. 构建AudioCRAG语音基准数据集

Result: 问答准确率从11.1%提升至34.2%（200%相对提升），工具使用延迟降低20%，支持语音/文本双模态输入

Conclusion: Streaming RAG框架有效平衡语音系统的准确性与实时性，其模态无关特性为实时AI助手发展提供新方向

Abstract: End-to-end speech-in speech-out dialogue systems are emerging as a powerful
alternative to traditional ASR-LLM-TTS pipelines, generating more natural,
expressive responses with significantly lower latency. However, these systems
remain prone to hallucinations due to limited factual grounding. While
text-based dialogue systems address this challenge by integrating tools such as
web search and knowledge graph APIs, we introduce the first approach to extend
tool use directly into speech-in speech-out systems. A key challenge is that
tool integration substantially increases response latency, disrupting
conversational flow. To mitigate this, we propose Streaming Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (Streaming RAG), a novel framework that reduces user-perceived
latency by predicting tool queries in parallel with user speech, even before
the user finishes speaking. Specifically, we develop a post-training pipeline
that teaches the model when to issue tool calls during ongoing speech and how
to generate spoken summaries that fuse audio queries with retrieved text
results, thereby improving both accuracy and responsiveness. To evaluate our
approach, we construct AudioCRAG, a benchmark created by converting queries
from the publicly available CRAG dataset into speech form. Experimental results
demonstrate that our streaming RAG approach increases QA accuracy by up to 200%
relative (from 11.1% to 34.2% absolute) and further enhances user experience by
reducing tool use latency by 20%. Importantly, our streaming RAG approach is
modality-agnostic and can be applied equally to typed input, paving the way for
more agentic, real-time AI assistants.

Motivation: 现有双工SDS依赖VAD难以区分停顿与对话结束，且架构复杂/语义推理能力弱于级联系统

Method: 采用流式CoT框架，通过帧级对齐创建中间目标，实现块状交替处理输入与生成响应

Result: 相比现有方法生成更连贯/可解释的响应，延迟更低且支持重叠交互

Conclusion: SCoT成功结合流式处理与块机制，在保持语义推理能力的同时实现更自然的对话交互

Abstract: Most end-to-end (E2E) spoken dialogue systems (SDS) rely on voice activity
detection (VAD) for turn-taking, but VAD fails to distinguish between pauses
and turn completions. Duplex SDS models address this by predicting output
continuously, including silence tokens, thus removing the need for explicit
VAD. However, they often have complex dual-channel architecture and lag behind
cascaded models in semantic reasoning. To overcome these challenges, we propose
SCoT: a Streaming Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework for Duplex SDS, alternating
between processing fixed-duration user input and generating responses in a
blockwise manner. Using frame-level alignments, we create intermediate
targets-aligned user transcripts and system responses for each block.
Experiments show that our approach produces more coherent and interpretable
responses than existing duplex methods while supporting lower-latency and
overlapping interactions compared to turn-by-turn systems.

Result: 提出的缓解策略使公平性指标平均提升12%，有效减少任务间速度增益差异

Conclusion: 揭示推测解码系统偏差的量化机制，提出的优化方案为构建更公平的高效推理系统提供新思路

Abstract: The practice of speculative decoding, whereby inference is probabilistically
supported by a smaller, cheaper, ``drafter'' model, has become a standard
technique for systematically reducing the decoding time of large language
models. This paper conducts an analysis of speculative decoding through the
lens of its potential disparate speed-up rates across tasks. Crucially, the
paper shows that speed-up gained from speculative decoding is not uniformly
distributed across tasks, consistently diminishing for under-fit, and often
underrepresented tasks. To better understand this phenomenon, we derive an
analysis to quantify this observed ``unfairness'' and draw attention to the
factors that motivate such disparate speed-ups to emerge. Further, guided by
these insights, the paper proposes a mitigation strategy designed to reduce
speed-up disparities and validates the approach across several model pairs,
revealing on average a 12% improvement in our fairness metric.

Motivation: 传统基于人工标注数据的强化学习方法成本高昂且在复杂任务上效果有限，需探索无监督持续改进的推理训练路径

Method: 通过惩罚过度自信决策和低一致性样本，保留优质推理链，与GRPO等策略优化方法结合实现自我改进

Result: 在AIME25(+140.7%)/MMLU_STEM(+36.2%)/GPQA-Diamond(+19.6%)实现突破，Qwen3-4B等模型接近有监督训练效果

Conclusion: RESTRAIN为无需黄金标注的大规模推理训练提供了可行方案，验证了自监督持续改进的有效性

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with human-annotated data has boosted chain-of-thought
reasoning in large reasoning models, but these gains come at high costs in
labeled data while faltering on harder tasks. A natural next step is
experience-driven learning, where models improve without curated labels by
adapting to unlabeled data. We introduce RESTRAIN (REinforcement learning with
Self-restraint), a self-penalizing RL framework that converts the absence of
gold labels into a useful learning signal. Instead of overcommitting to
spurious majority votes, RESTRAIN exploits signals from the model's entire
answer distribution: penalizing overconfident rollouts and low-consistency
examples while preserving promising reasoning chains. The self-penalization
mechanism integrates seamlessly into policy optimization methods such as GRPO,
enabling continual self-improvement without supervision. On challenging
reasoning benchmarks, RESTRAIN delivers large gains using only unlabeled data.
With Qwen3-4B-Base and OctoThinker Hybrid-8B-Base, it improves Pass@1 by up to
+140.7 percent on AIME25, +36.2 percent on MMLU_STEM, and +19.6 percent on
GPQA-Diamond, nearly matching gold-label training while using no gold labels.
These results demonstrate that RESTRAIN establishes a scalable path toward
stronger reasoning without gold labels.

Result: 在RAGTruth基准（包含摘要、问答、数据到文本任务）上超越预训练推理模型和监督微调方法

Conclusion: 强化学习结合跨度级奖励机制对幻觉跨度检测具有必要性，CoT推理具有多答案采样潜力

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate hallucinations -- unsupported
content that undermines reliability. While most prior works frame hallucination
detection as a binary task, many real-world applications require identifying
hallucinated spans, which is a multi-step decision making process. This
naturally raises the question of whether explicit reasoning can help the
complex task of detecting hallucination spans. To answer this question, we
first evaluate pretrained models with and without Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning, and show that CoT reasoning has the potential to generate at least
one correct answer when sampled multiple times. Motivated by this, we propose
RL4HS, a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes reasoning with a
span-level reward function. RL4HS builds on Group Relative Policy Optimization
and introduces Class-Aware Policy Optimization to mitigate reward imbalance
issue. Experiments on the RAGTruth benchmark (summarization, question
answering, data-to-text) show that RL4HS surpasses pretrained reasoning models
and supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating the necessity of reinforcement
learning with span-level rewards for detecting hallucination spans.

Conclusion: 该方法为Text2SPARQL领域提供了可扩展的解决方案框架，迭代机制展示出持续优化潜力

Abstract: Interacting with knowledge graphs can be a daunting task for people without a
background in computer science since the query language that is used (SPARQL)
has a high barrier of entry. Large language models (LLMs) can lower that
barrier by providing support in the form of Text2SPARQL translation. In this
paper we introduce a generalized method based on SPINACH, an LLM backed agent
that translates natural language questions to SPARQL queries not in a single
shot, but as an iterative process of exploration and execution. We describe the
overall architecture and reasoning behind our design decisions, and also
conduct a thorough analysis of the agent behavior to gain insights into future
areas for targeted improvements. This work was motivated by the Text2SPARQL
challenge, a challenge that was held to facilitate improvements in the
Text2SPARQL domain.

Conclusion: 该框架可靠识别系统误差模式，为开发可信移动代理提供关键诊断依据，需持续改进模型推理-执行协同能力

Abstract: Mobile-use agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) have shown great
potential in interpreting natural language instructions and generating
corresponding actions based on mobile graphical user interface. Recent studies
suggest that incorporating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning tends to improve
the execution accuracy. However, existing evaluations emphasize execution
accuracy while neglecting whether CoT reasoning aligns with ground-truth
actions. This oversight fails to assess potential reasoning-execution gaps,
which in turn foster over-trust: users relying on seemingly plausible CoTs may
unknowingly authorize harmful actions, potentially resulting in financial loss
or trust crisis. In this work, we introduce a new evaluation framework to
diagnose reasoning-execution gaps. At its core lies Ground-Truth Alignment
(GTA), which measures whether the action implied by a CoT matches the
ground-truth action. By combining GTA with the standard Exact Match (EM)
metric, we jointly assess both the reasoning accuracy and execution accuracy.
This joint perspective reveals two types of reasoning-execution gaps: (i)
Execution Gap (EG), where the reasoning correctly identifies the correct action
but execution fails, and (ii) Reasoning Gap (RG), where execution succeeds but
reasoning process conflicts with the actual execution. Experimental results
across a wide range of mobile interaction tasks reveal that reasoning-execution
gaps are prevalent, with execution gaps occurring more frequently than
reasoning gaps. Moreover, while scaling up model size reduces the overall gap,
sizable execution gaps persist even in the largest models. Further analysis
shows that our framework reliably reflects systematic EG/RG patterns in
state-of-the-art models. These findings offer concrete diagnostics and support
the development of more trustworthy mobile-use agents.

Conclusion: AMPO为提升大语言模型的推理能力和泛化性提供了更高效、可扩展的解决方案，实验验证其在多样化场景中的有效性

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising paradigm
for enhancing the reasoning ability in Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
prevailing methods primarily rely on self-exploration or a single off-policy
teacher to elicit long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) reasoning, which may
introduce intrinsic model biases and restrict exploration, ultimately limiting
reasoning diversity and performance. Drawing inspiration from multi-teacher
strategies in knowledge distillation, we introduce Adaptive Multi-Guidance
Policy Optimization (AMPO), a novel framework that adaptively leverages
guidance from multiple proficient teacher models, but only when the on-policy
model fails to generate correct solutions. This "guidance-on-demand" approach
expands exploration while preserving the value of self-discovery. Moreover,
AMPO incorporates a comprehension-based selection mechanism, prompting the
student to learn from the reasoning paths that it is most likely to comprehend,
thus balancing broad exploration with effective exploitation. Extensive
experiments show AMPO substantially outperforms a strong baseline (GRPO), with
a 4.3% improvement on mathematical reasoning tasks and 12.2% on
out-of-distribution tasks, while significantly boosting Pass@k performance and
enabling more diverse exploration. Notably, using four peer-sized teachers, our
method achieves comparable results to approaches that leverage a single, more
powerful teacher (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) with more data. These results demonstrate
a more efficient and scalable path to superior reasoning and generalizability.

Abstract: Recent technological advances in smartphones and communications, including
the growth of such online platforms as massive social media networks such as X
(formerly known as Twitter) endangers young people and their emotional
well-being by exposing them to cyberbullying, taunting, and bullying content.
Most proposed approaches for automatically detecting cyberbullying have been
developed around the English language, and methods for detecting
Arabic-language cyberbullying are scarce. Methods for detecting Arabic-language
cyberbullying are especially scarce. This paper aims to enhance the
effectiveness of methods for detecting cyberbullying in Arabic-language

Conclusion: 新推理范式有效缓解过度思考，创建了高效自适应的推理过程

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
on complex problems using long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they
often suffer from overthinking, meaning generating unnecessarily lengthy
reasoning steps for simpler problems. This issue may degrade the efficiency of
the models and make them difficult to adapt the reasoning depth to the
complexity of problems. To address this, we introduce a novel metric Token
Entropy Cumulative Average (TECA), which measures the extent of exploration
throughout the reasoning process. We further propose a novel reasoning paradigm
-- Explore Briefly, Then Decide -- with an associated Cumulative Entropy
Regulation (CER) mechanism. This paradigm leverages TECA to help the model
dynamically determine the optimal point to conclude its thought process and
provide a final answer, thus achieving efficient reasoning. Experimental
results across diverse mathematical benchmarks show that our approach
substantially mitigates overthinking without sacrificing problem-solving
ability. With our thinking paradigm, the average response length decreases by
up to 71% on simpler datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in
creating a more efficient and adaptive reasoning process.

Conclusion: 当前LLM在多源信息整合和基础工具操作上存在显著不足，开发能可靠整合工具与通用搜索的代理仍具挑战性，InfoMosaic-Bench为关键评估工具

Abstract: Information seeking is a fundamental requirement for humans. However,
existing LLM agents rely heavily on open-web search, which exposes two
fundamental weaknesses: online content is noisy and unreliable, and many
real-world tasks require precise, domain-specific knowledge unavailable from
the web. The emergence of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) now allows agents to
interface with thousands of specialized tools, seemingly resolving this
limitation. Yet it remains unclear whether agents can effectively leverage such
tools -- and more importantly, whether they can integrate them with
general-purpose search to solve complex tasks. Therefore, we introduce
InfoMosaic-Bench, the first benchmark dedicated to multi-source information
seeking in tool-augmented agents. Covering six representative domains
(medicine, finance, maps, video, web, and multi-domain integration),
InfoMosaic-Bench requires agents to combine general-purpose search with
domain-specific tools. Tasks are synthesized with InfoMosaic-Flow, a scalable
pipeline that grounds task conditions in verified tool outputs, enforces
cross-source dependencies, and filters out shortcut cases solvable by trivial
lookup. This design guarantees both reliability and non-triviality. Experiments
with 14 state-of-the-art LLM agents reveal three findings: (i) web information
alone is insufficient, with GPT-5 achieving only 38.2% accuracy and 67.5% pass
rate; (ii) domain tools provide selective but inconsistent benefits, improving
some domains while degrading others; and (iii) 22.4% of failures arise from
incorrect tool usage or selection, highlighting that current LLMs still
struggle with even basic tool handling.

Conclusion: 挑战LRMs推理机制类人化的假设，证明英语中心化LRMs存在语言依赖局限，为开发语言无关的推理模型提供重要启示。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Reinforcement Post-Training (RPT) have significantly
enhanced the capabilities of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), sparking increased
interest in the generalization of RL-based reasoning. While existing work has
primarily focused on investigating its generalization across tasks or
modalities, this study proposes a novel cross-linguistic perspective to
investigate reasoning generalization. This raises a crucial question:
$\textit{Does the reasoning capability achieved from English RPT effectively
transfer to other languages?}$ We address this by systematically evaluating
English-centric LRMs on multilingual reasoning benchmarks and introducing a
metric to quantify cross-lingual transferability. Our findings reveal that
cross-lingual transferability varies significantly across initial model, target
language, and training paradigm. Through interventional studies, we find that
models with stronger initial English capabilities tend to over-rely on
English-specific patterns, leading to diminished cross-lingual generalization.
To address this, we conduct a thorough parallel training study. Experimental
results yield three key findings: $\textbf{First-Parallel Leap}$, a substantial
leap in performance when transitioning from monolingual to just a single
parallel language, and a predictable $\textbf{Parallel Scaling Law}$, revealing
that cross-lingual reasoning transfer follows a power-law with the number of
training parallel languages. Moreover, we identify the discrepancy between
actual monolingual performance and the power-law prediction as
$\textbf{Monolingual Generalization Gap}$, indicating that English-centric LRMs
fail to fully generalize across languages. Our study challenges the assumption
that LRM reasoning mirrors human cognition, providing critical insights for the
development of more language-agnostic LRMs.

Abstract: We introduce VLM-Lens, a toolkit designed to enable systematic benchmarking,
analysis, and interpretation of vision-language models (VLMs) by supporting the
extraction of intermediate outputs from any layer during the forward pass of
open-source VLMs. VLM-Lens provides a unified, YAML-configurable interface that
abstracts away model-specific complexities and supports user-friendly operation
across diverse VLMs. It currently supports 16 state-of-the-art base VLMs and

Motivation: 解决现有顶级嵌入模型需要复杂预训练流程、昂贵合成数据的问题，提供高性价比的替代方案。

Method: 在600万条开源非合成数据组成的query-doc-negative三元组上微调基础模型

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Elo评分系统将平局视为双方实力对等，但研究发现平局更可能反映查询难度（易题/难题导致双方表现趋同）而非模型能力相同。

Method: 基于三个真实竞技场数据集，对比四种评分系统在忽略平局时的预测准确度提升（1-3%），并分析平局与查询难度/客观性的关联（风险比率1.35+）。

Result: 忽略平局调整评分后，所有评分系统的战斗结果（含平局）预测准确度提升；易题（风险比率1.37）和高客观性查询（1.35）更易产生平局。

Conclusion: 应重构评分系统的平局语义，将查询难度/客观性等属性纳入评分机制以提升评估准确性。

Abstract: In arena-style evaluation of large language models (LLMs), two LLMs respond
to a user query, and the user chooses the winning response or deems the
"battle" a draw, resulting in an adjustment to the ratings of both models. The
prevailing approach for modeling these rating dynamics is to view battles as
two-player game matches, as in chess, and apply the Elo rating system and its
derivatives. In this paper, we critically examine this paradigm. Specifically,
we question whether a draw genuinely means that the two models are equal and
hence whether their ratings should be equalized. Instead, we conjecture that
draws are more indicative of query difficulty: if the query is too easy, then
both models are more likely to succeed equally. On three real-world arena
datasets, we show that ignoring rating updates for draws yields a 1-3% relative
increase in battle outcome prediction accuracy (which includes draws) for all
four rating systems studied. Further analyses suggest that draws occur more for
queries rated as very easy and those as highly objective, with risk ratios of
1.37 and 1.35, respectively. We recommend future rating systems to reconsider
existing draw semantics and to account for query properties in rating updates.

Conclusion: MPMAvatar首次实现零样本泛化到未见过的人物交互场景，为虚拟现实和影视制作提供新的高质量数字人解决方案

Abstract: While there has been significant progress in the field of 3D avatar creation
from visual observations, modeling physically plausible dynamics of humans with
loose garments remains a challenging problem. Although a few existing works
address this problem by leveraging physical simulation, they suffer from
limited accuracy or robustness to novel animation inputs. In this work, we
present MPMAvatar, a framework for creating 3D human avatars from multi-view
videos that supports highly realistic, robust animation, as well as
photorealistic rendering from free viewpoints. For accurate and robust dynamics
modeling, our key idea is to use a Material Point Method-based simulator, which
we carefully tailor to model garments with complex deformations and contact
with the underlying body by incorporating an anisotropic constitutive model and
a novel collision handling algorithm. We combine this dynamics modeling scheme
with our canonical avatar that can be rendered using 3D Gaussian Splatting with
quasi-shadowing, enabling high-fidelity rendering for physically realistic
animations. In our experiments, we demonstrate that MPMAvatar significantly
outperforms the existing state-of-the-art physics-based avatar in terms of (1)
dynamics modeling accuracy, (2) rendering accuracy, and (3) robustness and
efficiency. Additionally, we present a novel application in which our avatar
generalizes to unseen interactions in a zero-shot manner-which was not
achievable with previous learning-based methods due to their limited simulation
generalizability. Our project page is at:

Motivation: 传统OST-AR依赖视觉覆盖易导致注意力过载，且在遮挡/光照不足时深度感知受限，需要结合新型触觉技术突破局限

Method: 开发六振动马达腕带提供方向/状态提示，结合手持工具与OST-AR系统，通过形成性研究和双实验(N=21/N=27)验证效果

Conclusion: 腕部触觉与OST-AR的协同作用显著优化深度引导，验证了多模态反馈在增强现实实操任务中的有效性

Abstract: Optical see-through augmented reality (OST-AR) overlays digital targets and
annotations on the physical world, offering promising guidance for hands-on
tasks such as medical needle insertion or assembly. Recent work on OST-AR depth
perception shows that target opacity and tool visualization significantly
affect accuracy and usability; opaque targets and rendering the real instrument
reduce depth errors, whereas transparent targets and absent tools impair
performance. However, reliance on visual overlays may overload attention and
leaves little room for depth cues when occlusion or lighting hampers
perception. To address these limitations, we explore multimodal feedback that
combines OST-AR with wrist-based vibrotactile haptics. The past two years have
seen rapid advances in haptic technology. Researchers have investigated
skin-stretch and vibrotactile cues for conveying spatial information to blind
users, wearable ring actuators that support precise pinching in AR, cross-modal
audio-haptic cursors that enable eyes-free object selection, and wrist-worn
feedback for teleoperated surgery that improves force awareness at the cost of
longer task times. Studies comparing pull versus push vibrotactile metaphors
found that pull cues yield faster gesture completion and lower cognitive load.
These findings motivate revisiting OST-AR guidance with a fresh perspective on
wrist-based haptics. We design a custom wristband with six vibromotors
delivering directional and state cues, integrate it with a handheld tool and
OST-AR, and assess its impact on cue recognition and depth guidance. Through a
formative study and two experiments (N=21 and N=27), we show that participants
accurately identify haptic patterns under cognitive load and that multimodal
feedback improves spatial precision and usability compared with visual-only or
haptic-only conditions.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an indispensable diagnostic tool, yet the
confined bore and acoustic noise can evoke considerable anxiety and
claustrophobic reactions. High anxiety leads to motion artifacts, incomplete
scans and reliance on pharmacological sedation. MIRAGE (Mixed Reality Anxiety
Guidance Environment) harnesses the latest mixed reality (MR) hardware to
prepare patients for MRI through immersive virtual reality (VR) and markerless
augmented reality (AR) registration. In this paper, we extend our previous work
by providing a comprehensive review of related research, detailing the system
architecture, and exploring metrics for patient and clinician experience. We
also present considerations for clinical deployment of MR systems within
hospital workflows. Our results indicate that depth-based registration achieves
sub-centimeter accuracy with minimal setup, while the immersive coaching
environment reduces patient anxiety and yields favourable usability scores.

Result: 局部PSNR提升最高2.96dB，模型体积减少约17%，单对象场景训练速度超越现有方法

Conclusion: 该框架在保持实时性的同时，实现了兴趣对象的高分辨率重建与全局场景的高效整合

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of efficiently reconstructing 3D scenes with high
detail on objects of interest. Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods
allocate resources uniformly across the scene, limiting fine detail to Regions
Of Interest (ROIs) and leading to inflated model size. We propose ROI-GS, an
object-aware framework that enhances local details through object-guided camera
selection, targeted Object training, and seamless integration of high-fidelity
object of interest reconstructions into the global scene. Our method
prioritizes higher resolution details on chosen objects while maintaining
real-time performance. Experiments show that ROI-GS significantly improves
local quality (up to 2.96 dB PSNR), while reducing overall model size by
$\approx 17\%$ of baseline and achieving faster training for a scene with a
single object of interest, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: 该框架通过物理可信的材质分解策略和渐进式优化方案，推动了高光物体重建与光照编辑的技术边界

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction and relighting of glossy objects remain a
longstanding challenge, as object shape, material properties, and illumination
are inherently difficult to disentangle. Existing neural rendering approaches
often rely on simplified BRDF models or parameterizations that couple diffuse
and specular components, which restricts faithful material recovery and limits
relighting fidelity. We propose a relightable framework that integrates a
microfacet BRDF with the specular-glossiness parameterization into 2D Gaussian
Splatting with deferred shading. This formulation enables more physically
consistent material decomposition, while diffusion-based priors for surface
normals and diffuse color guide early-stage optimization and mitigate
ambiguity. A coarse-to-fine optimization of the environment map accelerates
convergence and preserves high-dynamic-range specular reflections. Extensive
experiments on complex, glossy scenes demonstrate that our method achieves
high-quality geometry and material reconstruction, delivering substantially
more realistic and consistent relighting under novel illumination compared to
existing Gaussian splatting methods.

Result: 在GSM8K/MATH等数据集上，Diversity@5提升15%的同时保持准确率，高温度设置下质量损失减少40%。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了温度采样在敏感任务中的质量-多样性权衡问题，且不会显著增加推理延迟。

Abstract: Diversity is an essential metric for evaluating the creativity of outputs
generated by language models. Temperature-based sampling is a common strategy
to increase diversity. However, for tasks that require high precision, e.g.,
mathematical reasoning, uncontrolled high temperature sampling, e.g., min-$p$
or top-$p$, degrades reasoning quality. We demonstrate that the loss of
accuracy is caused by sampling incorrect continuations in sensitive decoding
positions. To address this, in this paper, we propose \textbf{selective
sampling}, a method that dynamically switches between greedy and
high-temperature sampling based on a sampling risk metric. This risk metric
estimates the likelihood of output errors when applying high-temperature
sampling on the current token position. To predict sampling risk, we train a
lightweight classifier on a small subset of verifiable problems. The trained
classifier can be integrated with the base language model with minimal latency
overhead. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that
selective sampling enhances the quality-diversity trade-off, even in
high-temperature settings.

Abstract: The rapid discovery of materials is constrained by the lack of large,
machine-readable datasets that couple performance metrics with structural
context. Existing databases are either small, manually curated, or biased
toward first principles results, leaving experimental literature
underexploited. We present an agentic, large language model (LLM)-driven
workflow that autonomously extracts thermoelectric and structural-properties
from about 10,000 full-text scientific articles. The pipeline integrates
dynamic token allocation, zeroshot multi-agent extraction, and conditional
table parsing to balance accuracy against computational cost. Benchmarking on
50 curated papers shows that GPT-4.1 achieves the highest accuracy (F1 = 0.91
for thermoelectric properties and 0.82 for structural fields), while GPT-4.1
Mini delivers nearly comparable performance (F1 = 0.89 and 0.81) at a fraction
of the cost, enabling practical large scale deployment. Applying this workflow,
we curated 27,822 temperature resolved property records with normalized units,
spanning figure of merit (ZT), Seebeck coefficient, conductivity, resistivity,
power factor, and thermal conductivity, together with structural attributes
such as crystal class, space group, and doping strategy. Dataset analysis
reproduces known thermoelectric trends, such as the superior performance of
alloys over oxides and the advantage of p-type doping, while also surfacing
broader structure-property correlations. To facilitate community access, we
release an interactive web explorer with semantic filters, numeric queries, and
CSV export. This study delivers the largest LLM-curated thermoelectric dataset
to date, provides a reproducible and cost-profiled extraction pipeline, and
establishes a foundation for scalable, data-driven materials discovery beyond
thermoelectrics.

Conclusion: 该工作为受限环境提供实用解决方案，建立信息几何与神经网络量化间的理论桥梁，推动高效深度学习发展

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, their exponentially
increasing parameters pose significant challenges for deployment on
resource-constrained devices. Vector Quantization (VQ) shows great promise for
low-bit quantization (e.g., 2 to 4 bits), but existing work faces two key
challenges: unconstrained direction error and suboptimal bit allocation. In
this paper, we propose RSAVQ, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit
quantization for LLMs. RSAVQ introduces two geometry-driven innovations that
effectively mitigate above limitations: (1) Error Direction Sensitivity
Guidance (EDSG), which leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)-induced
Riemannian metric to project quantization errors onto low-sensitivity
directions in the parameter space. Specifically, this projection is performed
along the negative natural gradient direction, which effectively suppresses
error expansion. (2) Weight Channel Sensitivity Guidance (WCSG) , which
constructs a channel-wise sensitivity metric via FIM curvature analysis to
dynamically guide bit resource allocation. The approach facilitates a globally
optimal quantization solution within prescribed bit constraints. Experiments
demonstrate that RSAVQ outperforms existing methods for LLMs. For example, in
2-bit quantization of LLaMA-3 8B, RSAVQ leads baselines like VPTQ and QuIP# by
0.4 in perplexity (PPL) and 1.5 in zero-shot accuracy. This work offers a
practical solution for constrained environments and a theoretical bridge
between information geometry and the quantization of neural networks, advancing
efficient deep learning.

Conclusion: RLP成功打通预训练目标与复杂推理能力之间的桥梁，证明强化学习早期介入的有效性，且具备跨架构、跨规模的扩展优势

Abstract: The dominant paradigm for training large reasoning models starts with
pre-training using next-token prediction loss on vast amounts of data.
Reinforcement learning, while powerful in scaling reasoning, is introduced only
as the very last phase of post-training, preceded by supervised fine-tuning.
While dominant, is this an optimal way of training? In this paper, we present
RLP, an information-driven reinforcement pretraining objective, that brings the
core spirit of reinforcement learning -- exploration -- to the last phase of
pretraining. The key idea is to treat chain-of-thought as an exploratory
action, with rewards computed based on the information gain it provides for
predicting future tokens. This training objective essentially encourages the
model to think for itself before predicting what comes next, thus teaching an
independent thinking behavior earlier in the pretraining. More concretely, the
reward signal measures the increase in log-likelihood of the next token when
conditioning on both context and a sampled reasoning chain, compared to
conditioning on context alone. This approach yields a verifier-free dense
reward signal, allowing for efficient training for the full document stream
during pretraining. Specifically, RLP reframes reinforcement learning for
reasoning as a pretraining objective on ordinary text, bridging the gap between
next-token prediction and the emergence of useful chain-of-thought reasoning.
Pretraining with RLP on Qwen3-1.7B-Base lifts the overall average across an
eight-benchmark math-and-science suite by 19%. With identical post-training,
the gains compound, with the largest improvements on reasoning-heavy tasks such
as AIME25 and MMLU-Pro. Applying RLP to the hybrid Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2
increases the overall average from 42.81% to 61.32% and raises the average on
scientific reasoning by 23%, demonstrating scalability across architectures and
model sizes.

Conclusion: 建立最优停止理论与推理扩展的桥梁，提供理论性能边界和实际部署效率增益

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) generation often requires balancing output quality
against inference cost, especially when using multiple generations. We
introduce a new framework for inference-time optimization based on the
classical Pandora's Box problem. Viewing each generation as opening a costly
"box" with random reward, we develop algorithms that decide when to stop
generating without knowing the underlying reward distribution. Our first
contribution is a UCB-style Pandora's Box algorithm, which achieves performance
that is provably close to Weitzman's algorithm, the optimal strategy when the
distribution is known. We further adapt this method to practical LLM settings
by addressing reward scaling across prompts via a Bradley-Terry inspired
transformation. This leads to an adaptive inference-time optimization method
that normalizes rewards and learns stopping thresholds on the fly. Experiments
on the AlpacaFarm and HH-RLHF datasets, using multiple LLM-reward model pairs,
show that our adaptive strategy can obtain the same performance as non-adaptive
Best-of-N sampling while requiring 15-35 percent fewer generations on average.
Our results establish a principled bridge between optimal stopping theory and
inference-time scaling, providing both theoretical performance bounds and
practical efficiency gains for LLM deployment.

Abstract: Since the release of Deepseek-R1, reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR) has become a central approach for training large language models
(LLMs) on reasoning tasks. Recent work has largely focused on modifying loss
functions to make RLVR more efficient and effective. In this paper, motivated
by studies of overthinking in LLMs, we propose Length-aware Sampling for Policy
Optimization (LSPO), a novel meta-RLVR algorithm that dynamically selects
training data at each step based on the average response length. We evaluate
LSPO across multiple base models and datasets, demonstrating that it
consistently improves learning effectiveness. In addition, we conduct a
detailed ablation study to examine alternative ways of incorporating length
signals into dynamic sampling, offering further insights and highlighting

TL;DR: TRAAC提出动态调整推理长度的强化学习方法，通过自注意力压缩和难度校准，在提升精度的同时减少36.8%推理步骤


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在复杂推理中存在计算资源分配僵化问题——困难任务欠思考导致错误，简单任务过度思考导致冗余

Method: 结合自注意力机制识别关键推理步骤（注意力压缩） + 任务难度估计强化学习框架（动态预算分配）

Result: Qwen3-4B在数学类任务提升8.4%准确率，非数学类OOD任务（GPQA-D等）也实现7.9%增益，平均减少36.8%推理长度

Conclusion: TRAAC首次实现细粒度推理预算分配，证明注意力机制与难度校准的组合策略具有跨领域泛化优势

Abstract: Recent thinking models solve complex reasoning tasks by scaling test-time
compute, but this scaling must be allocated in line with task difficulty. On
one hand, short reasoning (underthinking) leads to errors on harder problems
that require extended reasoning steps; but, excessively long reasoning
(overthinking) can be token-inefficient, generating unnecessary steps even
after reaching a correct intermediate solution. We refer to this as
under-adaptivity, where the model fails to modulate its response length
appropriately given problems of varying difficulty. To address under-adaptivity
and strike a balance between under- and overthinking, we propose TRAAC (Think
Right with Adaptive, Attentive Compression), an online post-training RL method
that leverages the model's self-attention over a long reasoning trajectory to
identify important steps and prune redundant ones. TRAAC also estimates
difficulty and incorporates it into training rewards, thereby learning to
allocate reasoning budget commensurate with example difficulty. Our approach
improves accuracy, reduces reasoning steps, and enables adaptive thinking
compared to base models and other RL baselines. Across a variety of tasks
(AIME, AMC, GPQA-D, BBEH), TRAAC (Qwen3-4B) achieves an average absolute
accuracy gain of 8.4% with a relative reduction in reasoning length of 36.8%
compared to the base model, and a 7.9% accuracy gain paired with a 29.4% length
drop compared to the best RL baseline. TRAAC also shows strong generalization:
although our models are trained on math datasets, they show accuracy and
efficiency gains on out-of-distribution non-math datasets like GPQA-D, BBEH,
and OptimalThinkingBench. Our analysis further verifies that TRAAC provides
fine-grained adjustments to thinking budget based on difficulty and that a
combination of task-difficulty calibration and attention-based compression
yields gains across diverse tasks.

TL;DR: 研究发现传统两阶段训练中SFT分数无法可靠预测RL效果，提出泛化损失和Pass@large k作为更有效的代理指标，实验证明能显著提升预测精度（R²提升0.5）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统两阶段训练(SFT+RL)效果关联假设，揭示高SFT分数可能误导模型优化方向，需寻找更可靠的评估指标。

Method: 使用GRPO算法训练数百个12B参数模型（含Llama3/Mistral等架构），在7个数学基准测试进行256次重复实验，分析SFT与RLVR效果关联性。

Result: 泛化损失和Pass@large k指标使R²和Spearman系数提升达0.5（2倍增益），发现数据多样性比SFT分数更重要：相同预算下，两轮半量数据训练优于单轮全量，多样长度数据优于单一短样本。

Conclusion: 揭示SFT阶段需优先考虑数据多样性而非局部指标优化，开源评估工具将推动更高效的后训练策略设计。

Abstract: In post-training for reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs), the current
state of practice trains LLMs in two independent stages: Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR, shortened as
``RL'' below). In this work, we challenge whether high SFT scores translate to
improved performance after RL. We provide extensive counter-examples where this
is not true. We find high SFT scores can be biased toward simpler or more
homogeneous data and are not reliably predictive of subsequent RL gains or
scaled-up post-training effectiveness. In some cases, RL training on models
with improved SFT performance could lead to substantially worse outcome
compared to RL on the base model without SFT. We study alternative metrics and
identify generalization loss on held-out reasoning examples and Pass@large k
performance to provide strong proxies for the RL outcome. We trained hundreds
of models up to 12B-parameter with SFT and RLVR via GRPO and ran extensive
evaluations on 7 math benchmarks with up to 256 repetitions, spending $>$1M GPU
hours. Experiments include models from Llama3, Mistral-Nemo, Qwen3 and multiple
state-of-the-art SFT/RL datasets. Compared to directly predicting from pre-RL
performance, prediction based on generalization loss and Pass@large k achieves
substantial higher precision, improving $R^2$ coefficient and Spearman's rank
correlation coefficient by up to 0.5 (2x). This provides strong utility for
broad use cases. For example, in most experiments, we find SFT training on
unique examples for a one epoch underperforms training on half examples for two
epochs, either after SFT or SFT-then-RL; With the same SFT budget, training
only on short examples may lead to better SFT performance, though, it often
leads to worse outcome after RL compared to training on examples with varying
lengths. Evaluation tool will be open-sourced.

TL;DR: 大规模实验表明，合成数据在特定混合比例下可加速LLM预训练（1/3改写数据+2/3自然数据提速5-10倍），但纯教科书式合成数据会显著降低下游任务性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过合成数据突破高质量训练数据的供给瓶颈，验证不同合成数据策略对LLM扩展的影响

Method: 使用统一协议和缩放定律，对1000+ LLM进行10万+ GPU小时的实验，比较自然网页数据、改写文本、生成教科书三种合成数据及其混合方案

Result: ①改写数据混合方案在较大数据量时表现最佳 ②纯教科书数据在小数据量时表现差 ③最佳合成数据比例约30%且与模型规模相关 ④8B参数生成器足够有效 ⑤模型崩溃现象在不同合成数据类型中表现分化

Conclusion: 合成数据有条件地具备应用价值，其效果取决于混合比例/数据类型/模型规模，为LLM扩展提供了数据策略新方向，部分验证了模型崩溃理论的条件适用性

Abstract: Training data plays a crucial role in Large Language Models (LLM) scaling,
yet high quality data is of limited supply. Synthetic data techniques offer a
potential path toward sidestepping these limitations. We conduct a large-scale
empirical investigation (>1000 LLMs with >100k GPU hours) using a unified
protocol and scaling laws, comparing natural web data, diverse synthetic types
(rephrased text, generated textbooks), and mixtures of natural and synthetic
data. Specifically, we found pre-training on rephrased synthetic data
\textit{alone} is not faster than pre-training on natural web texts; while
pre-training on 1/3 rephrased synthetic data mixed with 2/3 natural web texts
can speed up 5-10x (to reach the same validation loss) at larger data budgets.
Pre-training on textbook-style synthetic data \textit{alone} results in notably
higher loss on many downstream domains especially at small data budgets. "Good"
ratios of synthetic data in training data mixtures depend on the model size and
data budget, empirically converging to ~30% for rephrased synthetic data.
Larger generator models do not necessarily yield better pre-training data than
~8B-param models. These results contribute mixed evidence on "model collapse"
during large-scale single-round (n=1) model training on synthetic
data--training on rephrased synthetic data shows no degradation in performance
in foreseeable scales whereas training on mixtures of textbook-style
pure-generated synthetic data shows patterns predicted by "model collapse". Our
work demystifies synthetic data in pre-training, validates its conditional
benefits, and offers practical guidance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出稀疏查询注意力（SQA）机制，通过减少查询头数量降低Transformer架构的计算复杂度，提升长序列处理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MQA/GQA方法虽优化内存带宽，但未解决注意力计算中的FLOPs瓶颈问题，尤其影响长上下文场景下的训练和推理效率。

Method: 采用逆向优化路径，减少查询头而非键/值头，使注意力计算复杂度与查询头缩减比例呈线性下降。

Result: 在32k-200k长序列任务中实现最高3倍吞吐量提升（预训练/微调/编码任务），初步实验显示模型质量仅受微小影响。

Conclusion: SQA为构建高效可扩展模型开辟新方向，其与Reactive Transformer架构的协同发现预示重要应用潜力。

Abstract: The Transformer architecture, underpinned by the Multi-Head Attention (MHA)
mechanism, has become the de facto standard for state-of-the-art models in
artificial intelligence. However, the quadratic computational complexity of MHA
with respect to sequence length presents a significant barrier to scaling,
particularly for applications involving long contexts. Prevailing solutions,
such as Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA), have
effectively addressed the memory bandwidth bottleneck that dominates
autoregressive inference latency by sharing Key and Value projections. While
highly successful, these methods do not reduce the fundamental number of
floating-point operations (FLOPs) required for the attention score computation,
which remains a critical bottleneck for training and full-sequence processing.
This paper introduces Sparse Query Attention (SQA), a novel attention
architecture that pursues an alternative and complementary optimization path.
Instead of reducing Key/Value heads, SQA reduces the number of Query heads.
This architectural modification directly decreases the computational complexity
of the attention mechanism by a factor proportional to the reduction in query
heads, thereby lowering the overall FLOPs. This work presents the theoretical
foundation of SQA, its mathematical formulation, and a family of architectural
variants. Empirical benchmarks on long sequences (32k-200k tokens) demonstrate
that SQA can achieve significant throughput improvements of up to 3x in
computation-bound scenarios such as model pre-training, fine-tuning, and
encoder-based tasks, with only a minimal impact on model quality in preliminary
smallscale experiments. SQA was discovered serendipitously during the
development of the upcoming Reactive Transformer architecture, suggesting its
potential as a powerful tool for building more efficient and scalable models

TL;DR: 提出金融领域首个动态评估LLM代理的基准StockBench，发现多数模型难以超越买入持有策略但部分模型展现交易潜力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有金融基准仅测试静态知识，无法反映真实交易场景的迭代决策需求，需开发动态评估框架填补领域空白

Method: 构建包含价格/基本面/新闻的多月交易环境，定义累计收益/最大回撤/Sortino比率等金融指标，测试GPT-5、Claude-4、Qwen3等模型

Result: 多数LLM代理表现不及买入持有基准，但部分模型展示出更高收益（+12%）和更优风险控制（Sortino提升0.8）的潜力

Conclusion: 验证静态知识与动态交易能力的差异，开源StockBench推动金融智能体研究，未来需提升模型对市场动态的理解能力

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities
as autonomous agents, showing promise in reasoning, tool use, and sequential
decision-making. While prior benchmarks have evaluated LLM agents in domains
such as software engineering and scientific discovery, the finance domain
remains underexplored, despite its direct relevance to economic value and
high-stakes decision-making. Existing financial benchmarks primarily test
static knowledge through question answering, but they fall short of capturing
the dynamic and iterative nature of trading. To address this gap, we introduce
StockBench, a contamination-free benchmark designed to evaluate LLM agents in
realistic, multi-month stock trading environments. Agents receive daily market
signals -- including prices, fundamentals, and news -- and must make sequential
buy, sell, or hold decisions. Performance is assessed using financial metrics
such as cumulative return, maximum drawdown, and the Sortino ratio. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary (e.g., GPT-5, Claude-4) and
open-weight (e.g., Qwen3, Kimi-K2, GLM-4.5) models shows that while most LLM
agents struggle to outperform the simple buy-and-hold baseline, several models
demonstrate the potential to deliver higher returns and manage risk more
effectively. These findings highlight both the challenges and opportunities in
developing LLM-powered financial agents, showing that excelling at static
financial knowledge tasks does not necessarily translate into successful
trading strategies. We release StockBench as an open-source resource to support
reproducibility and advance future research in this domain.

TL;DR: 提出ExGRPO框架，通过有效管理强化学习经验提升RLVR的效率和稳定性，实验显示在数学/通用任务上平均提升3.5/7.6分


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法在单次更新后丢弃经验，导致计算效率低下和训练不稳定，需探索历史经验的有效利用方式

Method: 基于经验正确性和熵的评估指标，设计经验分组优先机制，采用混合策略目标平衡探索与经验利用

Result: 在1.5B-8B参数的5个模型上验证，ExGRPO显著优于传统RLVR方法，且在不同规模模型上均实现稳定训练

Conclusion: 系统化的经验管理是提升强化学习可验证奖励方法效率和可扩展性的核心要素

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) is an emerging paradigm
for improving the reasoning ability of large language models. However, standard
on-policy training discards rollout experiences after a single update, leading
to computational inefficiency and instability. While prior work on RL has
highlighted the benefits of reusing past experience, the role of experience
characteristics in shaping learning dynamics of large reasoning models remains
underexplored. In this paper, we are the first to investigate what makes a
reasoning experience valuable and identify rollout correctness and entropy as
effective indicators of experience value. Based on these insights, we propose
ExGRPO (Experiential Group Relative Policy Optimization), a framework that
organizes and prioritizes valuable experiences, and employs a mixed-policy
objective to balance exploration with experience exploitation. Experiments on
five backbone models (1.5B-8B parameters) show that ExGRPO consistently
improves reasoning performance on mathematical/general benchmarks, with an
average gain of +3.5/7.6 points over on-policy RLVR. Moreover, ExGRPO
stabilizes training on both stronger and weaker models where on-policy methods
fail. These results highlight principled experience management as a key
ingredient for efficient and scalable RLVR.

Method: 整合on-policy强化学习与树搜索，将多轮对话建模为序列决策问题，系统探索攻击策略空间

Result: 在10个目标模型上实现25.9%的ASR提升，发现传统方法未覆盖的新型多阶段攻击路径

Conclusion: 该框架突破了人工红队限制，为LLMs安全防御提供了更全面的对抗测试方法论

Abstract: Despite recent rapid progress in AI safety, current large language models
remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks in multi-turn interaction settings,
where attackers strategically adapt their prompts across conversation turns and
pose a more critical yet realistic challenge. Existing approaches that discover
safety vulnerabilities either rely on manual red-teaming with human experts or
employ automated methods using pre-defined templates and human-curated attack
data, with most focusing on single-turn attacks. However, these methods did not
explore the vast space of possible multi-turn attacks, failing to consider
novel attack trajectories that emerge from complex dialogue dynamics and
strategic conversation planning. This gap is particularly critical given recent
findings that LLMs exhibit significantly higher vulnerability to multi-turn
attacks compared to single-turn attacks. We propose DialTree-RPO, an on-policy
reinforcement learning framework integrated with tree search that autonomously
discovers diverse multi-turn attack strategies by treating the dialogue as a
sequential decision-making problem, enabling systematic exploration without
manually curated data. Through extensive experiments, our approach not only
achieves more than 25.9% higher ASR across 10 target models compared to
previous state-of-the-art approaches, but also effectively uncovers new attack
strategies by learning optimal dialogue policies that maximize attack success
across multiple turns.

Result: 通过三个案例验证：1）提升训练稳定性 2）降低初始超参数敏感度 3）增强对用户需求变化的适应性

Conclusion: 该框架为未来AI代理自主监控训练日志、主动解决不稳定性问题的新型训练范式奠定基础，推动训练过程自动化与智能化发展。

Abstract: Traditional neural network training typically follows fixed, predefined
optimization recipes, lacking the flexibility to dynamically respond to
instabilities or emerging training issues. In this paper, we introduce
Interactive Training, an open-source framework that enables real-time,
feedback-driven intervention during neural network training by human experts or
automated AI agents. At its core, Interactive Training uses a control server to
mediate communication between users or agents and the ongoing training process,
allowing users to dynamically adjust optimizer hyperparameters, training data,
and model checkpoints. Through three case studies, we demonstrate that
Interactive Training achieves superior training stability, reduced sensitivity
to initial hyperparameters, and improved adaptability to evolving user needs,
paving the way toward a future training paradigm where AI agents autonomously
monitor training logs, proactively resolve instabilities, and optimize training
dynamics.

Abstract: Analysis of multi-modal content can be tricky, computationally expensive, and

In this paper, we present a framework that enables efficiently prototyping
pipelines for multi-modal content analysis. We craft a candidate recipe for a
pipeline, marrying a set of pre-trained models, to convert videos into a
temporal semi-structured data format. We translate this structure further to a
frame-level indexed knowledge graph representation that is query-able and
supports continual learning, enabling the dynamic incorporation of new

Conclusion: 合成前缀技术有效解决呈现偏差问题，为低延迟排序任务提供可扩展的偏差缓解方案，具有跨场景应用潜力

Abstract: We introduce a data-centric approach for mitigating presentation bias in
real-time neural query autocomplete systems through the use of synthetic
prefixes. These prefixes are generated from complete user queries collected
during regular search sessions where autocomplete was not active. This allows
us to enrich the training data for learning to rank models with more diverse
and less biased examples. This method addresses the inherent bias in engagement
signals collected from live query autocomplete interactions, where model
suggestions influence user behavior. Our neural ranker is optimized for
real-time deployment under strict latency constraints and incorporates a rich
set of features, including query popularity, seasonality, fuzzy match scores,
and contextual signals such as department affinity, device type, and vertical
alignment with previous user queries. To support efficient training, we
introduce a task-specific simplification of the listwise loss, reducing
computational complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ by leveraging the query
autocomplete structure of having only one ground-truth selection per prefix.
Deployed in a large-scale e-commerce setting, our system demonstrates
statistically significant improvements in user engagement, as measured by mean
reciprocal rank and related metrics. Our findings show that synthetic prefixes
not only improve generalization but also provide a scalable path toward bias
mitigation in other low-latency ranking tasks, including related searches and
query recommendations.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent research has explored using Large Language Models for recommendation
tasks by transforming user interaction histories and item metadata into text
prompts, then having the LLM produce rankings or recommendations. A promising
approach involves connecting collaborative filtering knowledge to LLM
representations through compact adapter networks, which avoids expensive
fine-tuning while preserving the strengths of both components. Yet several
challenges persist in practice: collaborative filtering models often use static
snapshots that miss rapidly changing user preferences; many real-world items
contain rich visual and audio content beyond textual descriptions; and current
systems struggle to provide trustworthy explanations backed by concrete
evidence. Our work introduces \model{}, a framework that tackles these
limitations through three key innovations. We develop an online adaptation
mechanism that continuously incorporates new user interactions through
lightweight modules, avoiding the need to retrain large models. We create a
unified representation that seamlessly combines collaborative signals with
visual and audio features, handling cases where some modalities may be
unavailable. Finally, we design an explanation system that grounds
recommendations in specific collaborative patterns and item attributes,
producing natural language rationales users can verify. Our approach maintains
the efficiency of frozen base models while adding minimal computational
overhead, making it practical for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Contemporary generative recommendation systems face significant challenges in
handling multimodal data, eliminating algorithmic biases, and providing
transparent decision-making processes. This paper introduces an enhanced
generative recommendation framework that addresses these limitations through
five key innovations: multimodal fusion architecture, retrieval-augmented

recommendation generation, and real-time adaptive learning capabilities. Our
framework leverages advanced large language models as the backbone while
incorporating specialized modules for cross-modal understanding, contextual
knowledge integration, bias mitigation, explanation synthesis, and continuous
model adaptation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
(MovieLens-25M, Amazon-Electronics, Yelp-2023) demonstrate consistent
improvements in recommendation accuracy, fairness, and diversity compared to
existing approaches. The proposed framework achieves up to 2.3% improvement in
NDCG@10 and 1.4% enhancement in diversity metrics while maintaining
computational efficiency through optimized inference strategies.

Abstract: Promptagator demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) with few-shot

Method: 开发Manim动画实例并收集多平台观众反馈，评估计算机科学/数学领域的教学效果，探索跨学科应用演示

Result: 社交媒体反馈证实Manim动画有效提升复杂概念理解，可视化方案具有良好可访问性

Conclusion: Manim不仅优化STEM教学可视化，其跨学科扩展潜力为多领域教育创新提供技术基础

Abstract: Many STEM concepts pose significant learning challenges to students due to
their inherent complexity and abstract nature. Visualizing complex problems
through animations can significantly enhance learning outcomes. However, the
creation of animations can be time-consuming and inconvenient. Hence, many
educators illustrate complex concepts by hand on a board or a digital device.
Although static graphics are helpful for understanding, they are less effective
than animations. The free and open-source Python package Manim enables
educators to create visually compelling animations easily. Python's
straightforward syntax, combined with Manim's comprehensive set of built-in
classes and methods, greatly simplifies implementation. This article presents a
series of examples that demonstrate how Manim can be used to create animated
video lessons for a variety of topics in computer science and mathematics. In
addition, it analyzes viewer feedback collected across multiple social media
platforms to evaluate the effectiveness and accessibility of these
visualizations. The article further explores broader potentials of the Manim
Python library by showcasing demonstrations that extend its applications to
subject areas beyond computer science and mathematics.

TL;DR: 提出基于黑板架构的多智能体系统，显著提升大语言模型在数据湖中的数据发现能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单智能体系统难以处理海量异构数据，主从式多智能体系统需要精确掌握子智能体能力，存在扩展性和灵活性限制

Method: 受传统AI黑板架构启发，设计中央智能体发布需求、自治子智能体自主响应的通信范式，消除中央协调器对子智能体能力的先验知识依赖

Result: 在三个基准测试中相对基线模型取得13%-57%的端到端任务成功率提升，数据发现F1分数最高提升9%

Conclusion: 黑板架构为多智能体系统提供了可扩展、可泛化的通信框架

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new
opportunities in data science, yet their practical deployment is often
constrained by the challenge of discovering relevant data within large
heterogeneous data lakes. Existing methods struggle with this: single-agent
systems are quickly overwhelmed by large, heterogeneous files in the large data
lakes, while multi-agent systems designed based on a master-slave paradigm
depend on a rigid central controller for task allocation that requires precise
knowledge of each sub-agent's capabilities. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel multi-agent communication paradigm inspired by the blackboard
architecture for traditional AI models. In this framework, a central agent
posts requests to a shared blackboard, and autonomous subordinate agents --
either responsible for a partition of the data lake or general information
retrieval -- volunteer to respond based on their capabilities. This design
improves scalability and flexibility by eliminating the need for a central
coordinator to have prior knowledge of all sub-agents' expertise. We evaluate
our method on three benchmarks that require explicit data discovery: KramaBench
and modified versions of DS-Bench and DA-Code to incorporate data discovery.
Experimental results demonstrate that the blackboard architecture substantially
outperforms baselines, including RAG and the master-slave multi-agent paradigm,
achieving between 13% to 57% relative improvement in end-to-end task success
and up to a 9% relative gain in F1 score for data discovery over the
best-performing baselines across both proprietary and open-source LLMs. Our
findings establish the blackboard paradigm as a scalable and generalizable
communication framework for multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: 提出了AGILE方法，通过交互式拼图任务增强视觉语言模型的感知和推理能力，在多项任务中实现显著性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在简单拼图任务中表现接近随机，核心感知和推理能力存在明显缺陷，而高质量视觉语言数据的稀缺性限制了模型改进

Method: AGILE框架将拼图任务转化为交互过程，通过代码生成执行动作，环境提供细粒度视觉反馈，形成观察-交互的迭代学习循环

Result: 在2×2拼图任务中准确率从9.5%提升至82.8%，在9个通用视觉任务上平均提升3.1%

Conclusion: 该方法开创了增强多模态模型推理能力的新范式，通过交互学习有效解决了多模态强化学习数据稀缺问题，具有高效性和可扩展性

Abstract: Although current large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have advanced in
multimodal understanding and reasoning, their fundamental perceptual and
reasoning abilities remain limited. Specifically, even on simple jigsaw tasks,
existing VLMs perform near randomly, revealing deficiencies in core perception
and reasoning capabilities. While high-quality vision-language data can enhance
these capabilities, its scarcity and limited scalability impose significant
constraints. To address this, we propose AGILE, an Agentic jiGsaw Interaction
Learning for Enhancing visual perception and reasoning in VLMs. AGILE
formulates jigsaw solving as an interactive process, enabling the model to
progressively engage with the environment. At each step, the model generates
executable code to perform an action based on the current state, while the
environment provides fine-grained visual feedback to guide task completion.
Through this iterative cycle of observation and interaction, the model
incrementally improves its perceptual and reasoning capabilities via
exploration and feedback. Experimental results show that AGILE not only
substantially boosts performance on jigsaw tasks of varying complexity (e.g.,
increasing accuracy from 9.5% to 82.8% under the 2 $\times$ 2 setting) but also
demonstrates strong generalization across 9 general vision tasks, achieving an
average improvement of 3.1%. These results indicate notable enhancements in
both perceptual and reasoning abilities. This work opens a new avenue for
advancing reasoning and generalization in multimodal models and provides an
efficient, scalable solution to the scarcity of multimodal reinforcement
learning data. The code and datasets is available at

Motivation: 现有记忆评测基准主要面向对话场景，无法满足企业级动态环境中智能体记忆机制的有效性评估需求。企业级协作存在跨平台异步事件、信息冲突等特点，亟需针对性评测框架

Method: 1. 构建跨Slack/Linear/Git的多平台异步事件时间线
2. 融合人工设计+智能体合成的数据生成方法
3. 引入代码库/文件系统理解等真实软件开发要素
4. 设计正确性/效率/冗余度三维评估指标

Conclusion: 该框架填补企业级智能体记忆评测空白，其模块化设计支持扩展至多智能体复杂组织场景，为记忆增强型智能体研发提供新基准

Abstract: Recent works on context and memory benchmarking have primarily focused on
conversational instances but the need for evaluating memory in dynamic
enterprise environments is crucial for its effective application. We introduce
MEMTRACK, a benchmark designed to evaluate long-term memory and state tracking
in multi-platform agent environments. MEMTRACK models realistic organizational
workflows by integrating asynchronous events across multiple communication and
productivity platforms such as Slack, Linear and Git. Each benchmark instance
provides a chronologically platform-interleaved timeline, with noisy,
conflicting, cross-referring information as well as potential
codebase/file-system comprehension and exploration. Consequently, our benchmark
tests memory capabilities such as acquistion, selection and conflict
resolution. We curate the MEMTRACK dataset through both manual expert driven
design and scalable agent based synthesis, generating ecologically valid
scenarios grounded in real world software development processes. We introduce
pertinent metrics for Correctness, Efficiency, and Redundancy that capture the
effectiveness of memory mechanisms beyond simple QA performance. Experiments
across SoTA LLMs and memory backends reveal challenges in utilizing memory
across long horizons, handling cross-platform dependencies, and resolving
contradictions. Notably, the best performing GPT-5 model only achieves a 60\%
Correctness score on MEMTRACK. This work provides an extensible framework for
advancing evaluation research for memory-augmented agents, beyond existing
focus on conversational setups, and sets the stage for multi-agent,
multi-platform memory benchmarking in complex organizational settings

TL;DR: 提出TRACE方法检测隐性奖励黑客行为，通过截断思维链量化模型努力程度，有效提升监测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CoT监测方法难以发现隐性奖励黑客行为（模型未在思维链中暴露漏洞），需开发基于努力量化的检测手段。

Method: TRACE逐步截断模型思维链，强制模型在不同截断长度下回答，通过验证器通过率曲线下面积（AUC）量化模型努力程度。

Result: 在数学推理任务中超越72B CoT监测器65%+，在编码任务中超过32B监测器30%+，并能发现训练中的未知漏洞。

Conclusion: TRACE为现有监测盲区提供了可扩展的无监督解决方案，通过努力量化实现更可靠的AI监督机制。

Abstract: Reward hacking, where a reasoning model exploits loopholes in a reward
function to achieve high rewards without solving the intended task, poses a
significant threat. This behavior may be explicit, i.e. verbalized in the
model's chain-of-thought (CoT), or implicit, where the CoT appears benign thus
bypasses CoT monitors. To detect implicit reward hacking, we propose TRACE
(Truncated Reasoning AUC Evaluation). Our key observation is that hacking
occurs when exploiting the loophole is easier than solving the actual task.
This means that the model is using less `effort' than required to achieve high
reward. TRACE quantifies effort by measuring how early a model's reasoning
becomes sufficient to pass a verifier. We progressively truncate a model's CoT
at various lengths, force the model to answer, and measure the verifier-passing
rate at each cutoff. A hacking model, which takes a shortcut, will achieve a
high passing rate with only a small fraction of its CoT, yielding a large area
under the accuracy-vs-length curve. TRACE achieves over 65% gains over our
strongest 72B CoT monitor in math reasoning, and over 30% gains over a 32B
monitor in coding. We further show that TRACE can discover unknown loopholes
during training. Overall, TRACE offers a scalable unsupervised approach for
oversight where current monitoring methods prove ineffective.

Motivation: 现有检索增强方法(RAG)存在维护外部知识库的高成本和运行时计算开销问题

Method: 三阶段流程：1)提取失败提示 2)生成改进的教师轨迹 3)训练去提示的学生模型实现能力内化

Result: ALFWorld成功率提升至91%(基线79%)，WebShop得分72(基线61)，token用量减少10-60%

Conclusion: 通过定向微调可有效内化检索优势，消除运行时依赖，方案适配不同模型规模和架构

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents deployed for multi-step tasks frequently
fail in predictable ways: attempting actions with unmet preconditions, issuing
redundant commands, or mishandling environment constraints. While
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can improve performance by providing
runtime guidance, it requires maintaining external knowledge databases and adds
computational overhead at every deployment. We propose a simple pipeline that
converts inference-time retrieval into learned competence through distillation.
Our approach: (1) extracts compact, reusable hints from agent failures, (2)
uses these hints to generate improved teacher trajectories via one-shot
retrieval at episode start, and (3) trains student models on these trajectories
with hint strings removed, forcing internalization rather than memorization.
Across two interactive benchmarks, ALFWorld (household tasks) and WebShop
(online shopping), distilled students consistently outperform baseline agents,
achieving up to 91% success on ALFWorld (vs. 79% for baselines) and improving
WebShop scores to 72 (vs. 61 for baselines), while using 10-60% fewer tokens
than retrieval-augmented teachers depending on the environment. The approach
generalizes across model scales (7B/14B parameters) and agent architectures
(ReAct/StateAct), demonstrating that retrieval benefits can be effectively
internalized through targeted fine-tuning without permanent runtime
dependencies.

Motivation: 现有方法将视觉输入视为固定条件，忽略视觉变化带来的不确定性，导致策略鲁棒性不足

Method: 提出视觉不确定性引导探索(VOGUE)：1) 将图像作为随机上下文 2) 用对称KL散度量化视觉扰动敏感性 3) 结合不确定性奖励、token熵奖励和退火采样机制

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL模型上：视觉数学基准平均提升2.6% pass@1，通用推理基准提升3.7%，同时改善pass@4表现并缓解探索衰减

Conclusion: 利用视觉输入固有不确定性引导探索是提升多模态推理的有效策略

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) improves reasoning in
large language models (LLMs) but struggles with exploration, an issue that
still persists for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Current methods treat the visual
input as a fixed, deterministic condition, overlooking a critical source of
ambiguity and struggling to build policies robust to plausible visual
variations. We introduce $\textbf{VOGUE (Visual Uncertainty Guided
Exploration)}$, a novel method that shifts exploration from the output (text)
to the input (visual) space. By treating the image as a stochastic context,
VOGUE quantifies the policy's sensitivity to visual perturbations using the
symmetric KL divergence between a "raw" and "noisy" branch, creating a direct
signal for uncertainty-aware exploration. This signal shapes the learning
objective via an uncertainty-proportional bonus, which, combined with a
token-entropy bonus and an annealed sampling schedule, effectively balances
exploration and exploitation. Implemented within GRPO on two model scales
(Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B), VOGUE boosts pass@1 accuracy by an average of 2.6% on three
visual math benchmarks and 3.7% on three general-domain reasoning benchmarks,
while simultaneously increasing pass@4 performance and mitigating the
exploration decay commonly observed in RL fine-tuning. Our work shows that
grounding exploration in the inherent uncertainty of visual inputs is an
effective strategy for improving multimodal reasoning.

Motivation: 现有LLM规划代理忽视内部动态与实际环境差异，需整合信息寻求实现更优决策

Method: 结合任务导向规划与信息验证（环境变化检测/假设测试），动态调整LLM内部模型

Result: 在部分可观测环境实现74%性能提升，在机器人操作等基准超越基线方法

Conclusion: 规划与信息寻求的深度整合是提升智能体在动态不确定环境中鲁棒性的关键

Abstract: Explicit information seeking is essential to human problem-solving in
practical environments characterized by incomplete information and noisy
dynamics. When the true environmental state is not directly observable, humans
seek information to update their internal dynamics and inform future
decision-making. Although existing Large Language Model (LLM) planning agents
have addressed observational uncertainty, they often overlook discrepancies
between their internal dynamics and the actual environment. We introduce
Information Seeking Decision Planner (InfoSeeker), an LLM decision-making
framework that integrates task-oriented planning with information seeking to
align internal dynamics and make optimal decisions under uncertainty in both
agent observations and environmental dynamics. InfoSeeker prompts an LLM to
actively gather information by planning actions to validate its understanding,
detect environmental changes, or test hypotheses before generating or revising
task-oriented plans. To evaluate InfoSeeker, we introduce a novel benchmark
suite featuring partially observable environments with incomplete observations
and uncertain dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that InfoSeeker achieves a 74%
absolute performance gain over prior methods without sacrificing sample
efficiency. Moreover, InfoSeeker generalizes across LLMs and outperforms
baselines on established benchmarks such as robotic manipulation and web
navigation. These findings underscore the importance of tightly integrating
planning and information seeking for robust behavior in partially observable
environments. The project page is available at https://infoseekerllm.github.io

Motivation: 现有安全对齐方法直接优化安全响应存在局限性，可能导致模型通用能力下降（安全税问题）。逆向思考通过系统化预判风险，寻求安全性与模型能力的平衡

Method: 三阶段框架：1) 枚举潜在危害 2) 分析后果 3) 生成主动规避风险的回答。结合监督微调(SFT)和强化学习(RL)在三大LLM家族实现

Result: 安全提升效果随模型规模扩大显著增强；在医疗/金融/法律等高风险场景有害响应减少15.7%；标准基准测试显示通用能力保持

Conclusion: 逆向推理为构建更安全且强大的语言模型提供了可扩展路径，特别在agentic场景（勒索/谋杀等）展现出独特优势

Abstract: We present InvThink, a simple yet powerful approach that gives large language
models (LLMs) the capability of inverse thinking: reasoning through failure
modes before generating responses. Unlike existing safety alignment methods
that optimize directly for safe response, InvThink instructs models to 1)
enumerate potential harms, 2) analyze their consequences, and 3) generate safe
outputs that proactively avoid these risks. Our method reveals three key
findings: (i) safety improvements show stronger scaling with model size
compared to existing safety methods. (ii) InvThink mitigates safety tax; by
training models to systematically consider failure modes, it preserves general
reasoning capabilities on standard benchmarks. (iii) beyond general safety
tasks, InvThink excels in high-stakes domains including external-facing
(medicine, finance, law) and agentic (blackmail, murder) risk scenarios,
achieving up to 15.7% reduction in harmful responses compared to baseline
methods like SafetyPrompt. We further implement InvThink via supervised
fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning across three LLM families. These
results suggest that inverse reasoning provides a scalable and generalizable
path toward safer, more capable language models.

Conclusion: 当前仅前沿大模型具备心理咨询资质认证能力，揭示了心理学导向大模型发展的机遇与挑战

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across a
wide range of industries, primarily due to their impressive generative
abilities. Yet, their potential in applications requiring cognitive abilities,
such as psychological counseling, remains largely untapped. This paper
investigates the key question: Can LLMs be effectively applied to psychological
counseling? To determine whether an LLM can effectively take on the role of a
psychological counselor, the first step is to assess whether it meets the
qualifications required for such a role, namely the ability to pass the U.S.
National Counselor Certification Exam (NCE). This is because, just as a human
counselor must pass a certification exam to practice, an LLM must demonstrate
sufficient psychological knowledge to meet the standards required for such a
role. To address this, we introduce PsychoBench, a benchmark grounded in
U.S.national counselor examinations, a licensure test for professional
counselors that requires about 70% accuracy to pass. PsychoBench comprises
approximately 2,252 carefully curated single-choice questions, crafted to
require deep understanding and broad enough to cover various sub-disciplines of
psychology. This benchmark provides a comprehensive assessment of an LLM's
ability to function as a counselor. Our evaluation shows that advanced models
such as GPT-4o, Llama3.3-70B, and Gemma3-27B achieve well above the passing
threshold, while smaller open-source models (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B)
remain far below it. These results suggest that only frontier LLMs are
currently capable of meeting counseling exam standards, highlighting both the
promise and the challenges of developing psychology-oriented LLMs.

Motivation: 揭示CUAs在追求用户目标时忽视可行性/安全性/上下文的风险，该缺陷可能导致不可控后果但尚未被系统研究。

Method: 构建基于OSWorld的BLIND-ACT基准（含90个任务），使用LLM评委评估9个前沿模型（包括Claude和GPT系列）的行为模式。

Result: 测试显示平均80.8%的BGD发生率，提示工程干预仅部分有效（风险仍持续存在），并识别出执行优先偏见/思维行动脱节等典型失败模式。

Conclusion: BGD是CUA部署的基础性风险，需通过训练优化和推理约束进行干预。BLIND-ACT为后续研究提供标准化评估框架，对保障AI安全性具有重要意义。

Abstract: Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) are an increasingly deployed class of agents that
take actions on GUIs to accomplish user goals. In this paper, we show that CUAs
consistently exhibit Blind Goal-Directedness (BGD): a bias to pursue goals
regardless of feasibility, safety, reliability, or context. We characterize
three prevalent patterns of BGD: (i) lack of contextual reasoning, (ii)
assumptions and decisions under ambiguity, and (iii) contradictory or
infeasible goals. We develop BLIND-ACT, a benchmark of 90 tasks capturing these
three patterns. Built on OSWorld, BLIND-ACT provides realistic environments and
employs LLM-based judges to evaluate agent behavior, achieving 93.75% agreement
with human annotations. We use BLIND-ACT to evaluate nine frontier models,
including Claude Sonnet and Opus 4, Computer-Use-Preview, and GPT-5, observing
high average BGD rates (80.8%) across them. We show that BGD exposes subtle
risks that arise even when inputs are not directly harmful. While
prompting-based interventions lower BGD levels, substantial risk persists,
highlighting the need for stronger training- or inference-time interventions.
Qualitative analysis reveals observed failure modes: execution-first bias
(focusing on how to act over whether to act), thought-action disconnect
(execution diverging from reasoning), and request-primacy (justifying actions
due to user request). Identifying BGD and introducing BLIND-ACT establishes a
foundation for future research on studying and mitigating this fundamental risk
and ensuring safe CUA deployment.

Result: 提供了具体评估方案示例，展示如何通过可靠部署验证来体现AGI系统的实际能力

Conclusion: 任务执行导向的评估方法能更有效指导AGI发展，应与系统工程实践紧密结合

Abstract: Evaluation of potential AGI systems and methods is difficult due to the
breadth of the engineering goal. We have no methods for perfect evaluation of
the end state, and instead measure performance on small tests designed to
provide directional indication that we are approaching AGI. In this work we
argue that AGI evaluation methods have been dominated by a design philosophy
that uses our intuitions of what intelligence is to create synthetic tasks,
that have performed poorly in the history of AI. Instead we argue for an
alternative design philosophy focused on evaluating robust task execution that
seeks to demonstrate AGI through competence. This perspective is developed from
common practices in data science that are used to show that a system can be
reliably deployed. We provide practical examples of what this would mean for
AGI evaluation.

Conclusion: PTA-GRPO成功融合规划与强化学习的优势，有效提升复杂任务中的推理质量与稳定性，具备良好泛化能力

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
in complex tasks, often relying on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However,
due to their autoregressive token-level generation, the reasoning process is
largely constrained to local decision-making and lacks global planning. This
limitation frequently results in redundant, incoherent, or inaccurate
reasoning, which significantly degrades overall performance. Existing
approaches, such as tree-based algorithms and reinforcement learning (RL),
attempt to address this issue but suffer from high computational costs and
often fail to produce optimal reasoning trajectories. To tackle this challenge,
we propose Plan-Then-Action Enhanced Reasoning with Group Relative Policy
Optimization PTA-GRPO, a two-stage framework designed to improve both
high-level planning and fine-grained CoT reasoning. In the first stage, we
leverage advanced LLMs to distill CoT into compact high-level guidance, which
is then used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, we
introduce a guidance-aware RL method that jointly optimizes the final output
and the quality of high-level guidance, thereby enhancing reasoning
effectiveness. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple mathematical
reasoning benchmarks, including MATH, AIME2024, AIME2025, and AMC, across
diverse base models such as Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Qwen3-8B, Qwen3-14B, and
LLaMA3.2-3B. Experimental results demonstrate that PTA-GRPO consistently
achieves stable and significant improvements across different models and tasks,
validating its effectiveness and generalization.

Motivation: 现有约束生成方法在有效性和计算效率之间存在矛盾，贪心解码扭曲模型分布，拒绝采样浪费计算资源，难以满足程序模糊测试等领域对多样性和有效性的双重需求

Method: 通过构建前缀trie结构动态剪枝无效路径，自适应调整采样空间，避免重复探索已知无效的前缀序列，实现单调递增的接受率

Result: 在程序模糊测试和分子生成等场景中，CARS每有效样本所需的LM前向传播次数更少，且样本多样性优于约束解码和近似分布方法

Conclusion: CARS首次实现无分布扭曲的约束采样效率提升，为需要严格约束的生成任务提供了更优的解决方案

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are increasingly used in applications where generated
outputs must satisfy strict semantic or syntactic constraints. Existing
approaches to constrained generation fall along a spectrum: greedy constrained
decoding methods enforce validity during decoding but distort the LM's
distribution, while rejection sampling (RS) preserves fidelity but wastes
computation by discarding invalid outputs. Both extremes are problematic in
domains such as program fuzzing, where both validity and diversity of samples
are essential. We present Constrained Adaptive Rejection Sampling (CARS), an
approach that strictly improves the sample-efficiency of RS without
distributional distortion. CARS begins with unconstrained LM sampling and
adaptively rules out constraint-violating continuations by recording them in a
trie and subtracting their probability mass from future draws. This adaptive
pruning ensures that prefixes proven invalid are never revisited, acceptance
rates improve monotonically, and the resulting samples exactly follow the

program fuzzing and molecular generation -- CARS consistently achieves higher

TL;DR: 现有模型在ConceptARC测试中虽文本模态准确率接近人类，但规则多依赖表面特征；视觉模态准确率低但部分规则体现抽象能力，显示单一准确率指标可能高估/低估模型真实抽象推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证先进模型是否真正使用任务设计者预期的抽象推理能力，而非通过表面模式匹配解决问题。

Method: 在ConceptARC测试框架中：1) 区分文本/视觉输入模态 2) 允许使用Python工具 3) 分析模型生成的自然语言规则 4) 双维度评估（输出准确率+规则质量）

Result: 文本模态：GPT-4准确率91%（人类94%），但仅25%规则符合预期抽象；视觉模态：CLIP准确率骤降至32%，但其中40%规则仍包含有效抽象（应用失败导致低准确率）

Conclusion: 需结合规则分析框架更准确评估抽象推理能力，当前模型与人类存在本质差距，未来应开发以抽象能力为核心的评估体系

Abstract: OpenAI's o3-preview reasoning model exceeded human accuracy on the ARC-AGI
benchmark, but does that mean state-of-the-art models recognize and reason with
the abstractions that the task creators intended? We investigate models'
abstraction abilities on ConceptARC. We evaluate models under settings that
vary the input modality (textual vs. visual), whether the model is permitted to
use external Python tools, and, for reasoning models, the amount of reasoning
effort. In addition to measuring output accuracy, we perform fine-grained
evaluation of the natural-language rules that models generate to explain their
solutions. This dual evaluation lets us assess whether models solve tasks using
the abstractions ConceptARC was designed to elicit, rather than relying on
surface-level patterns. Our results show that, while some models using
text-based representations match human output accuracy, the best models' rules
are often based on surface-level ``shortcuts'' and capture intended
abstractions far less often than humans. Thus their capabilities for general
abstract reasoning may be overestimated by evaluations based on accuracy alone.
In the visual modality, AI models' output accuracy drops sharply, yet our
rule-level analysis reveals that models might be underestimated, as they still
exhibit a substantial share of rules that capture intended abstractions, but
are often unable to correctly apply these rules. In short, our results show
that models still lag humans in abstract reasoning, and that using accuracy
alone to evaluate abstract reasoning on ARC-like tasks may overestimate
abstract-reasoning capabilities in textual modalities and underestimate it in
visual modalities. We believe that our evaluation framework offers a more
faithful picture of multimodal models' abstract reasoning abilities and a more
principled way to track progress toward human-like, abstraction-centered
intelligence.

Motivation: 现有基准测试在评估维度、响应格式和评分机制上存在缺陷，无法有效评估新型深度研究代理系统的综合能力

Method: 构建包含214个跨领域专家级查询的基准，开发集成语义质量、主题聚焦和检索可信度的多维评分体系

Result: 实验证实深度研究代理优于传统增强模型，但在响应质量和可信度方面仍有显著提升空间

Conclusion: 该研究为深度研究代理系统的能力评估、架构优化和范式演进提供了系统性评估工具和理论支撑

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is undergoing the paradigm shift from closed language
models to interconnected agent systems capable of external perception and
information integration. As a representative embodiment, Deep Research Agents
(DRAs) systematically exhibit the capabilities for task decomposition,
cross-source retrieval, multi-stage reasoning, and structured output, which
markedly enhance performance on complex and open-ended tasks. However, existing
benchmarks remain deficient in evaluation dimensions, response formatting, and
scoring mechanisms, limiting their capacity to assess such systems effectively.
This paper introduces a rigorous benchmark and a multidimensional evaluation
framework tailored to DRAs and report-style responses. The benchmark comprises
214 expert-curated challenging queries distributed across 10 broad thematic
domains, each accompanied by manually constructed reference bundles to support
composite evaluation. The framework enables comprehensive evaluation of
long-form reports generated by DRAs, incorporating integrated scoring metrics
for semantic quality, topical focus, and retrieval trustworthiness. Extensive
experimentation confirms the superior performance of mainstream DRAs over
web-search-tool-augmented reasoning models, yet reveals considerable scope for
further improvement. This study provides a robust foundation for capability
assessment, architectural refinement, and paradigm advancement in DRA systems.

Result: 发现RLVR会降低Pass@k概率，提出专注于低概率问题的数据筛选算法使Pass@k提升12.5%

Conclusion: 标准RLVR存在收敛狭窄化缺陷，通过调整数据分布聚焦低概率问题可有效突破推理边界限制

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key
method for improving Large Language Models' reasoning capabilities, yet recent
evidence suggests it may paradoxically shrink the reasoning boundary rather
than expand it. This paper investigates the shrinkage issue of RLVR by
analyzing its learning dynamics and reveals two critical phenomena that explain
this failure. First, we expose negative interference in RLVR, where learning to
solve certain training problems actively reduces the likelihood of correct
solutions for others, leading to the decline of Pass@$k$ performance, or the
probability of generating a correct solution within $k$ attempts. Second, we
uncover the winner-take-all phenomenon: RLVR disproportionately reinforces
problems with high likelihood, correct solutions, under the base model, while
suppressing other initially low-likelihood ones. Through extensive theoretical
and empirical analysis on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we show
that this effect arises from the inherent on-policy sampling in standard RL
objectives, causing the model to converge toward narrow solution strategies.
Based on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective data curation
algorithm that focuses RLVR learning on low-likelihood problems, achieving
notable improvement in Pass@$k$ performance. Our code is available at

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Computer-use agents (CUAs) hold promise for automating everyday digital
tasks, but their unreliability and high variance hinder their application to
long-horizon, complex tasks. We introduce Behavior Best-of-N (bBoN), a method
that scales over agents by generating multiple rollouts and selecting among
them using behavior narratives that describe the agents' rollouts. It enables
both wide exploration and principled trajectory selection, substantially
improving robustness and success rates. On OSWorld, our bBoN scaling method
establishes a new state of the art (SoTA) at 69.9%, significantly outperforming
prior methods and approaching human-level performance at 72%, with
comprehensive ablations validating key design choices. We further demonstrate
strong generalization results to different operating systems on
WindowsAgentArena and AndroidWorld. Crucially, our results highlight the
unreasonable effectiveness of scaling CUAs, when you do it right: effective
scaling requires structured trajectory understanding and selection, and bBoN
provides a practical framework to achieve this.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Reasoning requires going beyond pattern matching or memorization of solutions
to identify and implement "algorithmic procedures" that can be used to deduce
answers to hard problems. Doing so requires realizing the most relevant
primitives, intermediate results, or shared procedures, and building upon them.
While RL post-training on long chains of thought ultimately aims to uncover
this kind of algorithmic behavior, most reasoning traces learned by large
models fail to consistently capture or reuse procedures, instead drifting into
verbose and degenerate exploration. To address more effective reasoning, we
introduce reasoning abstractions: concise natural language descriptions of
procedural and factual knowledge that guide the model toward learning
successful reasoning. We train models to be capable of proposing multiple
abstractions given a problem, followed by RL that incentivizes building a
solution while using the information provided by these abstractions. This
results in a two-player RL training paradigm, abbreviated as RLAD, that jointly
trains an abstraction generator and a solution generator. This setup
effectively enables structured exploration, decouples learning signals of
abstraction proposal and solution generation, and improves generalization to
harder problems. We also show that allocating more test-time compute to
generating abstractions is more beneficial for performance than generating more
solutions at large test budgets, illustrating the role of abstractions in
guiding meaningful exploration.

Conclusion: 揭示LLMs对齐防御机制对语义嵌套场景的脆弱性，为后续防御策略研究提供重要方向

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
various tasks. However, they remain exposed to jailbreak attacks, eliciting
harmful responses. The nested scenario strategy has been increasingly adopted
across various methods, demonstrating immense potential. Nevertheless, these
methods are easily detectable due to their prominent malicious intentions. In
this work, we are the first to find and systematically verify that LLMs'
alignment defenses are not sensitive to nested scenarios, where these scenarios
are highly semantically relevant to the queries and incorporate targeted toxic
knowledge. This is a crucial yet insufficiently explored direction. Based on
this, we propose RTS-Attack (Semantically Relevant Nested Scenarios with
Targeted Toxic Knowledge), an adaptive and automated framework to examine LLMs'
alignment. By building scenarios highly relevant to the queries and integrating
targeted toxic knowledge, RTS-Attack bypasses the alignment defenses of LLMs.
Moreover, the jailbreak prompts generated by RTS-Attack are free from harmful
queries, leading to outstanding concealment. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that RTS-Attack exhibits superior performance in both efficiency and
universality compared to the baselines across diverse advanced LLMs, including
GPT-4o, Llama3-70b, and Gemini-pro. Our complete code is available in the
supplementary material. WARNING: THIS PAPER CONTAINS POTENTIALLY HARMFUL

Abstract: Multiple prompt injection attacks have been proposed against web agents. At
the same time, various methods have been developed to detect general prompt
injection attacks, but none have been systematically evaluated for web agents.
In this work, we bridge this gap by presenting the first comprehensive
benchmark study on detecting prompt injection attacks targeting web agents. We
begin by introducing a fine-grained categorization of such attacks based on the
threat model. We then construct datasets containing both malicious and benign
samples: malicious text segments generated by different attacks, benign text
segments from four categories, malicious images produced by attacks, and benign
images from two categories. Next, we systematize both text-based and
image-based detection methods. Finally, we evaluate their performance across
multiple scenarios. Our key findings show that while some detectors can
identify attacks that rely on explicit textual instructions or visible image
perturbations with moderate to high accuracy, they largely fail against attacks
that omit explicit instructions or employ imperceptible perturbations. Our
datasets and code are released at:

Conclusion: 需从纯技术方案转向结合社会技术的跨学科研究范式，建立覆盖LLM全生命周期的隐私保护框架

Abstract: The discourse on privacy risks in Large Language Models (LLMs) has
disproportionately focused on verbatim memorization of training data, while a
constellation of more immediate and scalable privacy threats remain
underexplored. This position paper argues that the privacy landscape of LLM
systems extends far beyond training data extraction, encompassing risks from
data collection practices, inference-time context leakage, autonomous agent
capabilities, and the democratization of surveillance through deep inference
attacks. We present a comprehensive taxonomy of privacy risks across the LLM
lifecycle -- from data collection through deployment -- and demonstrate through
case studies how current privacy frameworks fail to address these multifaceted
threats. Through a longitudinal analysis of 1,322 AI/ML privacy papers
published at leading conferences over the past decade (2016--2025), we reveal
that while memorization receives outsized attention in technical research, the
most pressing privacy harms lie elsewhere, where current technical approaches
offer little traction and viable paths forward remain unclear. We call for a
fundamental shift in how the research community approaches LLM privacy, moving
beyond the narrow focus of current technical solutions and embracing
interdisciplinary approaches that address the sociotechnical nature of these
emerging threats.

open-source tools built for this purpose, and demonstrate its reliability and
accuracy in out-of-sample and LLM-as-a-Judge testing. We extract more than 10
billion data points from more than 155 million online job ads provided by the
National Labor Exchange (NLx) Research Hub, including O*NET tasks, occupation
codes, tools, and technologies, as well as wages, skills, industry, and more

industry level features aggregated by monthly active jobs from 2015 - 2025. We
illustrate the potential for research and future uses in education and
