To address these limitations, we introduce a more general form of\ncounterfactual data augmentation, termed counterbias data augmentation, which\nsimultaneously tackles multiple biases (e.g., gender bias, simplicity bias) and\nenhances out-of-distribution robustness. We present CoBA: CounterBias\nAugmentation, a unified framework that operates at the semantic triple level:\nfirst decomposing text into subject-predicate-object triples, then selectively\nmodifying these triples to disrupt spurious correlations. By reconstructing the\ntext from these adjusted triples, CoBA generates counterbias data that\nmitigates spurious patterns. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that\nCoBA not only improves downstream task performance, but also effectively\nreduces biases and strengthens out-of-distribution resilience, offering a\nversatile and robust solution to the challenges posed by spurious correlations."}

Its core argument is that the statistical interpretation of the\nnormal--understood as the average both in the normative and mathematical sense\nof the term--proves useful for understanding the Turing test in at least two\nways. First, in the sense that the Turing test targets normal/average rather\nthan exceptional human intelligence, so that successfully passing the test\nrequires building machines that \"make mistakes\" and display imperfect behavior\njust like normal/average humans. Second, in the sense that the Turing test is a\nstatistical test where judgments of intelligence are never carried out by a\nsingle \"average\" judge (understood as non-expert) but always by a full jury. As\nsuch, the notion of \"average human interrogator\" that Turing talks about in his\noriginal paper should be understood primarily as referring to a mathematical\nabstraction made of the normalized aggregate of individual judgments of\nmultiple judges. In short, this paper argues that the Turing test is a test of\nnormal intelligence as assessed by a normal judge characterizing the average\njudgment of a pool of human interrogators. Its conclusions are twofold. First,\nit argues that large language models such as ChatGPT are unlikely to pass the\nTuring test as those models precisely target exceptional rather than\nnormal/average human intelligence. As such, they constitute models of what it\nproposes to call artificial smartness rather than artificial intelligence per\nse. Second, it argues that the core question of whether the Turing test can\ncontribute anything to the understanding of human cognition is that of whether\nthe human mind is really reducible to the normal/average mind--a question which\nlargely extends beyond the Turing test itself and questions the conceptual\nunderpinnings of the normalist paradigm it belongs to."}

We employ a dual approach: first, we measure the\n\"steerability\" of two well-known open-source LLMs using instruction prompting\nand activation steering. We find that while some models can easily switch\nbetween liberal and conservative viewpoints, others exhibit resistance or an\nincreased rate of refusal, suggesting a more entrenched ideological structure.\nSecond, we probe the internal mechanisms of these models using Sparse\nAutoencoders (SAEs).

The key challenge for reasoning\ntasks is designing a scoring function that can identify correct reasoning\nchains without access to ground-truth answers. We propose Probabilistic\nConfidence Selection And Ranking (PiCSAR): a simple, training-free method that\nscores each candidate generation using the joint log-likelihood of the\nreasoning and final answer. The joint log-likelihood of the reasoning and final\nanswer naturally decomposes into reasoning confidence and answer confidence.\nPiCSAR achieves substantial gains across diverse benchmarks (+10.18 on MATH500,\n+9.81 on AIME2025), outperforming baselines with at least 2x fewer samples in\n16 out of 20 comparisons. Our analysis reveals that correct reasoning chains\nexhibit significantly higher reasoning and answer confidence, justifying the\neffectiveness of PiCSAR."}

This leaves a gap in an\ninvestigator or counter-fraud professional's toolset when looking to augment\ntheir knowledge of payment flow originator and beneficiary entities and trace\nfunds and assets. A gap that vendors traditionally try to close with fuzzy\nmatching tools.

Through a systematic and comprehensive examination of a series of\ncounterintuitive claims, supported by rigorous experimental validation across\ndifferent model architectures and task domains, our findings show that while\nstandard RL training remains consistently robust across settings, many of these\ncounterintuitive results arise only when the model and task already exhibit\nstrong model-task alignment.
