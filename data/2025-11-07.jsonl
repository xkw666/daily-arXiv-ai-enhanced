The need for effective mechanisms for behavioural manipulation\nof the model during generation is a critical gap in the literature that needs\nto be fulfilled. Personality-aware LLMs hold a promising direction towards this\nobjective. However, the relationship between these psychological constructs and\ntheir representations within LLMs remains underexplored and requires further\ninvestigation. Moreover, it is intriguing to understand and study the use of\nthese representations to steer the models' behaviour. We propose a novel\npipeline that extracts hidden state activations from transformer layers using\nthe Big Five Personality Traits (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion,\nAgreeableness and Neuroticism), which is a comprehensive and empirically\nvalidated framework to model human personality applies low-rank subspace\ndiscovery methods, and identifies trait-specific optimal layers across\ndifferent model architectures for robust injection. The resulting\npersonality-aligned directions are then operationalised through a flexible\nsteering framework with dynamic layer selection, enabling precise control of\ntrait expression in LLM outputs. Our findings reveal that personality traits\noccupy a low-rank shared subspace, and that these latent structures can be\ntransformed into actionable mechanisms for effective steering through careful\nperturbations without impacting the fluency, variance and general capabilities,\nhelping to bridge the gap between psychological theory and practical model\nalignment."}

Materials and Methods: In this\nretrospective study, we built upon a state-of-the-art, transformer-based, PHI\nde-identification pipeline by fine-tuning on two large annotated radiology\ncorpora from Stanford University, encompassing chest X-ray, chest CT,\nabdomen/pelvis CT, and brain MR reports and introducing an additional PHI\ncategory (AGE) into the architecture. Model performance was evaluated on test\nsets from Stanford and the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) for token-level\nPHI detection. We further assessed (1) the stability of synthetic PHI\ngeneration using a \"hide-in-plain-sight\" method and (2) performance against\ncommercial systems. Precision, recall, and F1 scores were computed across all\nPHI categories. Results: Our model achieved overall F1 scores of 0.973 on the\nPenn dataset and 0.996 on the Stanford dataset, outperforming or maintaining\nthe previous state-of-the-art model performance. Synthetic PHI evaluation\nshowed consistent detectability (overall F1: 0.959 [0.958-0.960]) across 50\nindependently de-identified Penn datasets. Our model outperformed all vendor\nsystems on synthetic Penn reports (overall F1: 0.960 vs. 0.632-0.754).\nDiscussion: Large-scale, multimodal training improved cross-institutional\ngeneralization and robustness. Synthetic PHI generation preserved data utility\nwhile ensuring privacy. Conclusion: A transformer-based de-identification model\ntrained on diverse radiology datasets outperforms prior academic and commercial\nsystems in PHI detection and establishes a new benchmark for secure clinical\ntext processing."}

Later, Angluin gave a precise\ncharacterization of language collections for which this task is possible.\nMotivated by recent positive results for the related problem of language\ngeneration, we revisit the classic language identification problem in the\nsetting where the learner is given the additional power of producing a list of\n$k$ guesses at each time step. The goal is to ensure that beyond some finite\ntime, one of the guesses is correct at each time step.\n  We give an exact characterization of collections of languages that can be\n$k$-list identified in the limit, based on a recursive version of Angluin's\ncharacterization (for language identification with a list of size $1$).

As a result, the field lacks\nrobust tools for assessing the realism of LLM-generated text or for calibrating\nmodels to real-world data. This paper makes two contributions. First, we\nintroduce a computational Turing test: a validation framework that integrates\naggregate metrics (BERT-based detectability and semantic similarity) with\ninterpretable linguistic features (stylistic markers and topical patterns) to\nassess how closely LLMs approximate human language within a given dataset.\nSecond, we systematically compare nine open-weight LLMs across five calibration\nstrategies -- including fine-tuning, stylistic prompting, and context retrieval\n-- benchmarking their ability to reproduce user interactions on X (formerly\nTwitter), Bluesky, and Reddit.

Despite its significance, tokenization in the\ncontext of assembly code remains an underexplored area. This study aims to\naddress this gap by evaluating the intrinsic properties of Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP) tokenization models and parameter choices, such as vocabulary\nsize. We explore preprocessing customization options and pre-tokenization rules\ntailored to the unique characteristics of assembly code. Additionally, we\nassess their impact on downstream tasks like function signature prediction -- a\ncritical problem in binary code analysis.\n  To this end, we conduct a thorough study on various tokenization models,\nsystematically analyzing their efficiency in encoding assembly instructions and\ncapturing semantic nuances. Through intrinsic evaluations, we compare\ntokenizers based on tokenization efficiency, vocabulary compression, and\nrepresentational fidelity for assembly code. Using state-of-the-art pre-trained\nmodels such as the decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) Llama 3.2, the\nencoder-only transformer BERT, and the encoder-decoder model BART, we evaluate\nthe effectiveness of these tokenizers across multiple performance metrics.\nPreliminary findings indicate that tokenizer choice significantly influences\ndownstream performance, with intrinsic metrics providing partial but incomplete\npredictability of extrinsic evaluation outcomes.

We probe 10 LLMs with 63 items from the Hofstede\nValues Survey Module and World Values Survey, translated into 11 languages, and\nformulated as prompts with and without different explicit cultural\nperspectives. Our study confirms that both prompt language and cultural\nperspective produce variation in LLM outputs, but with an important caveat:\nWhile targeted prompting can, to a certain extent, steer LLM responses in the\ndirection of the predominant values of the corresponding countries, it does not\novercome the models' systematic bias toward the values associated with a\nrestricted set of countries in our dataset: the Netherlands, Germany, the US,\nand Japan.

We systematically analyzed a large-scale dataset of\napproximately one billion Japanese blog articles linked to Wikipedia\nvocabulary, and observed consistent patterns in web search trend data (English,\nSpanish, and Japanese). Our analysis of the 2,965 selected items reveals that\nabout 55% (1,625 items) were found to have no abrupt jumps and were well\ncaptured by one or two segments. For single-segment curves, we found that (i)\nthe mode of the shape parameter alpha was near 0.5, indicating prevalent\nsub-exponential growth; (ii) the ultimate diffusion scale is primarily\ndetermined by the growth rate R, with minor contributions from alpha or the\nduration T; and (iii) alpha showed a tendency to vary with the nature of the\ntopic, being smaller for niche/local topics and larger for widely shared ones.\nFurthermore, a micro-behavioral model distinguishing outward contact with\nstrangers from inward interaction within their community suggests that alpha\ncan be interpreted as an index of the preference for outward-oriented\ncommunication. These findings suggest that sub-exponential growth is a common\npattern of social diffusion, and our model provides a practical framework for\nconsistently describing, comparing, and interpreting complex and diverse growth\ncurves."}

Here, we address this gap by developing a\ndigital twin of game-theoretic experiments and introducing a systematic\nprompting and probing framework for machine-behavioral evaluation. Testing\nthree open-source models (Llama, Mistral and Qwen), we find that Llama\nreproduces human cooperation patterns with high fidelity, capturing human\ndeviations from rational choice theory, while Qwen aligns closely with Nash\nequilibrium predictions.

Cooperation\nunfolds through a two-phase negotiation protocol: agents first propose\ncandidate roles with reasoning and then commit to a joint allocation under\nconsensus and environment constraints. After commitment, each agent\nindependently generates and executes a symbolic plan for its role without\nrevealing detailed trajectories.
