With watermarking, we can always accurately detect LLM-generated texts. However, recent findings suggest that these techniques often negatively affect the quality of the generated texts, and adversarial attacks can strip the watermarking signals, causing the texts to possibly evade detection. These findings have created resistance in the wide adoption of watermarking by LLM creators. Finally, to encourage adoption, we evaluate the robustness of several watermarking techniques to adversarial attacks by comparing paraphrasing and back translation (i.e., English $\\to$ another language $\\to$ English) attacks; and their ability to preserve quality and writing style of the unwatermarked texts by using linguistic metrics to capture quality and writing style of texts. Our results suggest that these watermarking techniques preserve semantics, deviate from the writing style of the unwatermarked texts, and are susceptible to adversarial attacks, especially for the back translation attack.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u8d28\u91cf/\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\u5bfc\u81f4\u6587\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u3001\u6613\u53d7\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdbLLM\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u91c7\u7528\u8be5\u6280\u672f", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8f6c\u8ff0\u653b\u51fb\u4e0e\u56de\u8bd1\u653b\u51fb\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u6587\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5199\u4f5c\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b", "result": "\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u4f46\u6539\u53d8\u5199\u4f5c\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u4e14\u6613\u53d7\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\uff08\u56de\u8bd1\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\u6700\u663e\u8457\uff09", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u624d\u80fd\u5e7f\u6cdb\u91c7\u7528"}}

B2F takes a facial style reference as input, generating facial animations that reflect the provided style while maintaining consistency with the associated body motion.

We represent style using discrete latent codes learned via the Gumbel-Softmax trick, enabling diverse expression generation with a structured latent representation. B2F outputs facial motion in the FLAME format, making it compatible with SMPL-X characters, and supports ARKit-style avatars through a dedicated conversion module.

A Study on GM-Extract and Mitigations", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI"], "comment": "To be submitted for publication", "summary": "The diminishing ability of large language models (LLMs) to effectively utilize long-range context-the \"lost-in-the-middle\" phenomenon-poses a significant challenge in retrieval-based LLM applications. To study the impact of this phenomenon in a real-world application setting, we introduce GM-Extract, a novel benchmark dataset meticulously designed to evaluate LLM performance on retrieval of control variables. To accurately diagnose failure modes, we propose a simple yet elegant evaluation system using two distinct metrics: one for spatial retrieval capability (Document Metric) and the other for semantic retrieval capability (Variable Extraction Metric). We conduct a systematic evaluation of 7-8B parameter models on two multi-document tasks (key-value extraction and question-answering), demonstrating a significant change in retrieval performance simply by altering how the data is represented in the context window. While a distinct U-shaped curve was not consistently observed, our analysis reveals a clear pattern of performance across models, which we further correlate with perplexity scores.

By leveraging the musculoskeletal model as a strong prior, our method enables energy-aware and morphology-adaptive locomotion to emerge without motion data. The framework generalizes across human, non-human, and synthetic morphologies, where distinct energy-efficient strategies naturally appear--for example, quadrupedal gaits in Chimanoid versus bipedal gaits in Humanoid. The latent space and corresponding control policy are constructed from scratch, without demonstration, and enable downstream tasks such as goal navigation and path following--representing, to our knowledge, the first motion-free method to provide such capabilities. FreeMusco learns diverse and physically plausible locomotion behaviors through model-based reinforcement learning, guided by the locomotion objective that combines control, balancing, and biomechanical terms. To better capture the periodic structure of natural gait, we introduce the temporally averaged loss formulation, which compares simulated and target states over a time window rather than on a per-frame basis. We further encourage behavioral diversity by randomizing target poses and energy levels during training, enabling locomotion to be flexibly modulated in both form and intensity at runtime. Together, these results demonstrate that versatile and adaptive locomotion control can emerge without motion capture, offering a new direction for simulating movement in characters where data collection is impractical or impossible.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u52a8\u4f5c\u6355\u6349\u6846\u67b6FreeMusco\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f62\u6001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u808c\u8089\u9aa8\u9abc\u89d2\u8272\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5bfc\u822a\u7b49\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u808c\u8089\u9aa8\u9abc\u89d2\u8272\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u4f9d\u8d56\u52a8\u4f5c\u6355\u6349\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u56f0\u96be\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u975e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5f62\u6001\u3001\u5408\u6210\u751f\u7269\uff09\u4e2d\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u63a7\u5236/\u5e73\u8861/\u751f\u7269\u529b\u5b66\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u5e73\u5747\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u968f\u673a\u5316\u7b56\u7565", "result": "\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b/\u975e\u4eba\u7c7b/\u5408\u6210\u5f62\u6001\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u80fd\u91cf\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u6b65\u6001\uff08\u5982Chimanoid\u56db\u8db3\u6b65\u6001 vs Humanoid\u53cc\u8db3\u6b65\u6001\uff09\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u8fd0\u52a8\u5f3a\u5ea6\u8c03\u8282", "conclusion": "\u9996\u6b21\u8bc1\u660e\u65e0\u9700\u52a8\u4f5c\u6355\u6349\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6837\u5316\u3001\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u53ef\u5f97\u573a\u666f\u7684\u865a\u62df\u89d2\u8272\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u62df\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f"}}

However, existing parameterizations of implicit fields lack explicit mechanisms to ensure a tight fit between the surface and input data. To address this, we propose a novel energy equation that balances the reliability of point cloud information. Additionally, we introduce a new convolutional network that learns three-dimensional information to achieve superior optimization results. This approach ensures that the reconstructed surface closely adheres to the raw input points and infers valuable inductive biases from point clouds, resulting in a highly accurate and stable surface reconstruction.

Large language models (LLMs) offer new potential for analyzing these reports, but often generate unreliable or hallucinated outputs when domain grounding is absent. This study introduces the Mixture-of-Retrieval Agentic RAG (MoRA-RAG), a knowledge-grounded LLM framework that transforms reconnaissance reports into a structured foundation for multi-hazard reasoning. The framework integrates a Mixture-of-Retrieval mechanism that dynamically routes queries across hazard-specific databases while using agentic chunking to preserve contextual coherence during retrieval. It also includes a verification loop that assesses evidence sufficiency, refines queries, and initiates targeted searches when information remains incomplete. We construct HazardRecQA by deriving question-answer pairs from GEER reconnaissance reports, which document 90 global events across seven major hazard types.

In fact, the intricate geometry of 3D urban environments results in high degrees of occlusion and requires extensive manual viewpoint adjustments that make large-scale exploration inefficient. To address this, we propose a view-based approach for 3D data exploration, where a vector field encodes views from the environment. To support this approach, we introduce a neural field-based method that constructs an efficient implicit representation of 3D environments. This representation enables both faster direct queries, which consist of the computation of view assessment indices, and inverse queries, which help avoid occlusion and facilitate the search for views that match desired data patterns. Our approach supports key urban analysis tasks such as visibility assessments, solar exposure evaluation, and assessing the visual impact of new developments. We validate our method through quantitative experiments, case studies informed by real-world urban challenges, and feedback from domain experts.

In this paper, we propose HiEAG, a novel Hierarchical Evidence-Augmented Generation framework to refine external consistency checking through leveraging the extensive knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our approach decomposes external consistency checking into a comprehensive engine pipeline, which integrates reranking and rewriting, apart from retrieval. Evidence reranking module utilizes Automatic Evidence Selection Prompting (AESP) that acquires the relevant evidence item from the products of evidence retrieval. Subsequently, evidence rewriting module leverages Automatic Evidence Generation Prompting (AEGP) to improve task adaptation on MLLM-based OOC misinformation detectors. Furthermore, our approach enables explanation for judgment, and achieves impressive performance with instruction tuning.

We fine-tune two state-of-the-art transformer-based models, PLM-ICD and GKI-ICD, on both the original and extended datasets.

KGs are structured representations of factual knowledge consisting of entities and relations. Due to the high construction cost, they had been regarded as static databases with validated links. However, the recent development of Transformer-based relation extraction (RE) methods has enabled us to generate KGs dynamically by giving them natural language texts, and thereby opened the possibility for representing the meaning of the input sentences with the created KGs. Using this effect, we propose a method that answers MCQs in the \"fill-in-the-blank\" format, taking care of the point that RE methods generate KGs that represent false information if provided with factually incorrect texts. We measure the truthfulness of each question sentence by (i) converting the sentence into a relational graph using an RE method and (ii) verifying it against factually correct KGs under the closed-world assumption. The experimental results demonstrate that our method correctly answers up to around 70% of the questions, while providing traceability of the procedure.

Yet, we lack a clear understanding of where these symbolic hallucinations originate, making it crucial to systematically handle such triggers and localize the emergence of hallucination inside the model. While prior work explored localization using statistical techniques like LSC and activation variance analysis, these methods treat all tokens equally and overlook the role symbolic linguistic knowledge plays in triggering hallucinations. So far, no approach has investigated how symbolic elements specifically drive hallucination failures across model layers, nor has symbolic linguistic knowledge been used as the foundation for a localization framework. We propose the first symbolic localization framework that leverages symbolic linguistic and semantic knowledge to meaningfully trace the development of hallucinations across all model layers. By focusing on how models process symbolic triggers, we analyze five models using HaluEval and TruthfulQA. Our symbolic knowledge approach reveals that attention variance for these linguistic elements explodes to critical instability in early layers (2-4), with negation triggering catastrophic variance levels, demonstrating that symbolic semantic processing breaks down from the very beginning. Through the lens of symbolic linguistic knowledge, despite larger model sizes, hallucination rates remain consistently high (78.3%-83.7% across Gemma variants), with steep attention drops for symbolic semantic triggers throughout deeper layers. Our findings demonstrate that hallucination is fundamentally a symbolic linguistic processing failure, not a general generation problem, revealing that symbolic semantic knowledge provides the key to understanding and localizing hallucination mechanisms in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7b26\u53f7\u8bed\u4e49\u77e5\u8bc6\u662f\u5b9a\u4f4dLLM\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u5dee\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u7b26\u53f7\u8bed\u4e49\u5904\u7406\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\u5df2\u5d29\u6e83", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u672a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5904\u7406\u7b26\u53f7\u89e6\u53d1\u56e0\u7d20\uff08\u5426\u5b9a/\u6570\u5b57/\u547d\u540d\u5b9e\u4f53\u7b49\uff09\u4e0e\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b26\u53f7\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6846\u67b6", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b26\u53f7\u8bed\u8a00\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790Gemma\u7b495\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5728HaluEval\u548cTruthfulQA\u4e0a\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236", "result": "\u7b26\u53f7\u89e6\u53d1\u56e0\u7d20\u57282-4\u5c42\u5373\u51fa\u73b0\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u5dee\u7206\u70b8\uff08\u5426\u5b9a\u89e6\u53d1\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe93.7%\uff09\uff0c\u5404\u89c4\u6a21Gemma\u6a21\u578b\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\u5747\u8d8578%", "conclusion": "\u5e7b\u89c9\u672c\u8d28\u662f\u7b26\u53f7\u8bed\u4e49\u5904\u7406\u5931\u8d25\u800c\u975e\u901a\u7528\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7b26\u53f7\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3LLM\u5e7b\u89c9\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u952e\u89c6\u89d2"}}

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential for enhancing EL performance. Prior research has leveraged LLMs to improve entity disambiguation and input representation, yielding significant gains in accuracy and robustness. However, these approaches typically apply LLMs to isolated stages of the EL task, failing to fully integrate their capabilities throughout the entire process.\n  In this work, we introduce DeepEL, a comprehensive framework that incorporates LLMs into every stage of the entity linking task. Furthermore, we identify that disambiguating entities in isolation is insufficient for optimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel self-validation mechanism that utilizes global contextual information, enabling LLMs to rectify their own predictions and better recognize cohesive relationships among entities within the same sentence.\n  Extensive empirical evaluation across ten benchmark datasets demonstrates that DeepEL substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average improvement of 2.6\\% in overall F1 score and a remarkable 4% gain on out-of-domain datasets.

Arabic has a complicated morphological and syntactic structure, posing a greater challenge than other languages. Even though modern neural models have improved greatly in recent years, the majority of previous attempts used individual models without taking into account the potential benefits of combining different systems. In this paper, we present one of the first multi-system approaches for correcting grammatical errors in Arabic, the Arab Enhanced Edit Selection System Complication (ArbESC+). Several models are used to collect correction proposals, which are represented as numerical features in the framework. A classifier determines and implements the appropriate corrections based on these features. In order to improve output quality, the framework uses support techniques to filter overlapping corrections and estimate decision reliability. A combination of AraT5, ByT5, mT5, AraBART, AraBART+Morph+GEC, and Text editing systems gave better results than a single model alone, with F0.5 at 82.63% on QALB-14 test data, 84.64% on QALB-15 L1 data, and 65.55% on QALB-15 L2 data.

Existing approaches simulate a simplified workflow where actors dub directly without preparation, overlooking the critical director-actor interaction. In contrast, authentic workflows involve a dynamic collaboration: directors actively engage with actors, guiding them to internalize the context cues, specifically emotion, before performance. To address this issue, we propose a new Retrieve-Augmented Director-Actor Interaction Learning scheme to achieve authentic movie dubbing, termed Authentic-Dubber, which contains three novel mechanisms: (1) We construct a multimodal Reference Footage library to simulate the learning footage provided by directors. Note that we integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve deep comprehension of emotional representations across multimodal signals. (2) To emulate how actors efficiently and comprehensively internalize director-provided footage during dubbing, we propose an Emotion-Similarity-based Retrieval-Augmentation strategy. This strategy retrieves the most relevant multimodal information that aligns with the target silent video. (3) We develop a Progressive Graph-based speech generation approach that incrementally incorporates the retrieved multimodal emotional knowledge, thereby simulating the actor's final dubbing process.

Despite this momentum, there exists no publicly available application-specific model evaluation that caters to Africa's linguistic diversity. We present AfriSpeech-MultiBench, the first domain-specific evaluation suite for over 100 African English accents across 10+ countries and seven application domains: Finance, Legal, Medical, General dialogue, Call Center, Named Entities and Hallucination Robustness. We benchmark a diverse range of open, closed, unimodal ASR and multimodal LLM-based speech recognition systems using both spontaneous and non-spontaneous speech conversation drawn from various open African accented English speech datasets. Our empirical analysis reveals systematic variation: open-source ASR models excels in spontaneous speech contexts but degrades on noisy, non-native dialogue; multimodal LLMs are more accent-robust yet struggle with domain-specific named entities; proprietary models deliver high accuracy on clean speech but vary significantly by country and domain. Models fine-tuned on African English achieve competitive accuracy with lower latency, a practical advantage for deployment, hallucinations still remain a big problem for most SOTA models.

Existing compression methods have achieved partial success but overlook a crucial phenomenon in the training process -- the entropy conflict. During compression training, entropy decreases, leading to shorter reasoning but limited exploration, while accuracy-oriented objectives increase entropy, lengthening reasoning chains. This can cause the model to get stuck in a local dilemma. Our analysis further reveals the origin of the entropy conflict: many high-entropy tokens are logical connectors that receive larger gradients and are encouraged under the performance objective, while the compression objective simultaneously penalizes these potentially redundant connectors. This opposing pressure creates a direct source of entropy conflict. To address these issues, we adopt an entropy-guided training framework. As entropy descends, the model is guided toward efficient reasoning by encouraging concise thought steps; as entropy rises, exploration is reinforced under the compact reasoning mode to improve robustness.

To bridge this gap, we introduce ConInstruct, a benchmark specifically designed to assess LLMs' ability to detect and resolve conflicts within user instructions.

DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-4.5-Sonnet achieve the highest average F1-scores at 91.5% and 87.3%, respectively, ranking first and second overall.

We tackle an issue we call label length bias, where labels of different lengths are treated inconsistently, even after standard length normalization. To mitigate it, we propose normalized contextual calibration (NCC), an effective method that normalizes and calibrates predictions at the full-label level. NCC achieves statistically significant improvements over prior approaches across multiple datasets and models, with gains of up to 10% F1. Moreover, NCC extends bias mitigation to broader tasks such as multiple-choice question answering. Our analysis shows that, when combined with in-context learning, NCC is less sensitive to few-shot example selection, requires fewer examples for competitive performance, and produces more reliable confidence estimates.

However, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak and fine-tuning attacks, which can compromise safety alignment and lead to harmful outputs. Existing studies mainly focus on general safety evaluations, with limited attention to the unique safety requirements of educational scenarios. To address this gap, we construct EduHarm, a benchmark containing safe-unsafe instruction pairs across five representative educational scenarios, enabling systematic safety evaluation of educational LLMs. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage shield framework (TSSF) for educational LLMs that simultaneously mitigates both jailbreak and fine-tuning attacks. First, safety-aware attention realignment redirects attention toward critical unsafe tokens, thereby restoring the harmfulness feature that discriminates between unsafe and safe inputs. Second, layer-wise safety judgment identifies harmfulness features by aggregating safety cues across multiple layers to detect unsafe instructions.

We present MedBench v4, a nationwide, cloud-based benchmarking infrastructure comprising over 700,000 expert-curated tasks spanning 24 primary and 91 secondary specialties, with dedicated tracks for LLMs, multimodal models, and agents. Items undergo multi-stage refinement and multi-round review by clinicians from more than 500 institutions, and open-ended responses are scored by an LLM-as-a-judge calibrated to human ratings. We evaluate 15 frontier models. Base LLMs reach a mean overall score of 54.1/100 (best: Claude Sonnet 4.5, 62.5/100), but safety and ethics remain low (18.4/100). Multimodal models perform worse overall (mean 47.5/100; best: GPT-5, 54.9/100), with solid perception yet weaker cross-modal reasoning. Agents built on the same backbones substantially improve end-to-end performance (mean 79.8/100), with Claude Sonnet 4.5-based agents achieving up to 85.3/100 overall and 88.9/100 on safety tasks. MedBench v4 thus reveals persisting gaps in multimodal reasoning and safety for base models, while showing that governance-aware agentic orchestration can markedly enhance benchmarked clinical readiness without sacrificing capability.

The system is designed as a reflective space for emotional processing rather than a substitute for professional therapy. It illustrates how conversational assistants can lower barriers to support, complement existing care, and broaden access to mental health resources. To address the shortage of confidential therapeutic data, we introduce synthetic client-therapist dialogue generation conditioned on client profiles. Finally, the planner demonstrates an innovative agentic workflow for dynamically adaptive, personalized self-care, bridging the limitations of static well-being tools. We describe the architecture, demonstrate its functionalities, and report evaluation of the RAG assistant in curated well-being scenarios using both automatic LLM-based judgments and a human-user study.

Currently, this emerging field lacks in-depth exploration into RL approaches specifically tailored for the LLM Agent context, alongside a scarcity of flexible and easily extensible training frameworks designed for this purpose. To help advance this area, this paper first revisits and clarifies Reinforcement Learning methodologies for LLM Agents by systematically extending the Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework to comprehensively define the key components of an LLM Agent. Secondly, we introduce Agent-R1, a modular, flexible, and user-friendly training framework for RL-based LLM Agents, designed for straightforward adaptation across diverse task scenarios and interactive environments.

Transition probabilities between states and progression to CKD were estimated using multi-state modeling. After identifying common post-AKI trajectories, CKD risk factors in AKI subpopulations were identified through survival analysis. Of 20,699 patients with AKI at admission, 3,491 (17%) developed CKD.

In one such case--the comparative illusion (CI), e.g., More students have been to Russia than I have--comprehenders tend to judge the sentence as acceptable despite its underlying nonsensical comparison. Prior research has argued that this phenomenon can be explained as Bayesian inference over a noisy channel: the posterior probability of an interpretation of a sentence is proportional to both the prior probability of that interpretation and the likelihood of corruption into the observed (CI) sentence. Initial behavioral work has supported this claim by evaluating a narrow set of alternative interpretations of CI sentences and showing that comprehenders favor interpretations that are more likely to have been corrupted into the illusory sentence. In this study, we replicate and go substantially beyond this earlier work by directly predicting the strength of illusion with a quantitative model of the posterior probability of plausible interpretations, which we derive through a novel synthesis of statistical language models with human behavioral data. Our model explains not only the fine gradations in the strength of CI effects, but also a previously unexplained effect caused by pronominal vs. full noun phrase than-clause subjects. These findings support a noisy-channel theory of sentence comprehension by demonstrating that the theory makes novel predictions about the comparative illusion that bear out empirically. This outcome joins related evidence of noisy channel processing in both illusory and non-illusory contexts to support noisy channel inference as a unified computational-level theory of diverse language processing phenomena.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper validates noisy-channel theory by modeling comparative illusion strength through language models and behavioral data, explaining subtle CI effects and pronoun/noun phrase influences.", "motivation": "To demonstrate noisy-channel inference as a unified explanation for language illusions by quantitatively predicting CI effect strength and resolving unexplained pronoun-related effects.", "method": "Developed a quantitative posterior probability model through novel integration of statistical language models with human behavioral data.", "result": "Model successfully explained gradations in CI effects and revealed novel pronoun vs. noun phrase subject influences on illusion strength.", "conclusion": "Findings support noisy-channel theory as a unified computational framework explaining diverse language processing phenomena in both illusory and non-illusory contexts."}}

However, it has been observed that even in log-log scale, the type-token curve is still slightly concave, invalidating the power-law relation. At the next-order approximation, we have shown, by twenty English novels or writings (some are translated from another language to English), that quadratic functions in log-log scale fit the type-token data perfectly. Regression analyses of log(type)-log(token) data with both a linear and quadratic term consistently lead to a linear coefficient of slightly larger than 1, and a quadratic coefficient around -0.02. Using the ``random drawing colored ball from the bag with replacement\" model, we have shown that the curvature of the log-log scale is identical to a ``pseudo-variance\" which is negative. Although a pseudo-variance calculation may encounter numeric instability when the number of tokens is large, due to the large values of pseudo-weights, this formalism provides a rough estimation of the curvature when the number of tokens is small.", "AI": {"tldr": "Heap\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u4fee\u6b63\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u82f1\u6587\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1log-log\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u4e0b\u4e8c\u6b21\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u62df\u5408\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4f2a\u65b9\u5dee\u89e3\u91ca\u66f2\u7387\u73b0\u8c61", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfHeap\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7684\u5e42\u5f8b\u5173\u7cfb\u5728log-log\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u4e0b\u4ecd\u5448\u73b0\u8f7b\u5fae\u51f9\u5ea6\uff0c\u9700\u9a8c\u8bc1\u66f4\u9ad8\u9636\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u6570\u5b66\u672c\u8d28", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u752820\u90e8\u82f1\u6587\u8457\u4f5c\uff08\u542b\u8bd1\u672c\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8bcd\u578b-\u8bcd\u4f8b\u5206\u6790\n2. log-log\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u4e0b\u4e8c\u6b21\u51fd\u6570\u56de\u5f52\n3. \u57fa\u4e8e'\u888b\u4e2d\u5f69\u7403\u968f\u673a\u62bd\u53d6'\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u5bfc\u4f2a\u65b9\u5dee\u7406\u8bba", "result": "1. \u56de\u5f52\u7cfb\u6570\u663e\u793a\u7ebf\u6027\u9879\u22481.0\uff0c\u4e8c\u6b21\u9879\u2248-0.02\n2. \u66f2\u7387\u5bf9\u5e94\u8d1f\u4f2a\u65b9\u5dee\u73b0\u8c61\n3. \u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u6599\u65f6\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u503c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027", "conclusion": "\u4e8c\u6b21\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u63cf\u8ff0\u7c7b\u578b-\u8bcd\u4f8b\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4f2a\u65b9\u5dee\u7406\u8bba\u4e3a\u65e9\u671f\u8bed\u6599\u589e\u957f\u6a21\u5f0f\u63d0\u4f9b\u6570\u5b66\u89e3\u91ca\u6846\u67b6"}}

However, existing approaches \\textit{mainly focus on self-correction within the model}, which falls short of the ``teacher-style`` correction required in educational settings, \\textit{i.e.}, systematically guiding and revising a student's problem-solving process. To address this gap, we propose \\texttt{SMRC} (\\textit{\\underline{S}tudent \\underline{M}athematical \\underline{R}easoning \\underline{C}orrection}), a novel method that aligns LLMs with student reasoning. Specifically, \\texttt{SMRC} formulates student reasoning as a multi-step sequential decision problem and introduces Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explore optimal correction paths. To reduce the cost of the annotating process-level rewards, we leverage breadth-first search (BFS) guided by LLMs and final-answer evaluation to generate reward signals, which are then distributed across intermediate reasoning steps via a back-propagation mechanism, enabling fine-grained process supervision. Additionally, we construct a benchmark for high school mathematics, MSEB (Multi-Solution Error Benchmark), consisting of 158 instances that include problem statements, student solutions, and correct reasoning steps. We further propose a dual evaluation protocol centered on \\textbf{solution accuracy} and \\textbf{correct-step retention}, offering a comprehensive measure of educational applicability. Experiments demonstrate that \\texttt{SMRC} significantly outperforms existing methods on two public datasets (ProcessBench and MR-GSM8K) and our MSEB in terms of effectiveness and overall performance.

This work advances the field by leveraging multimodal, multi-turn customer support dialogues, where users often share both textual complaints and visual evidence (e.g., screenshots, product photos) to enable fine-grained classification of complaint aspects and severity. We introduce VALOR, a Validation-Aware Learner with Expert Routing, tailored for this multimodal setting. It employs a multi-expert reasoning setup using large-scale generative models with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting for nuanced decision-making. To ensure coherence between modalities, a semantic alignment score is computed and integrated into the final classification through a meta-fusion strategy. In alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), the proposed framework supports SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) by advancing AI-driven tools for robust, scalable, and context-aware service infrastructure. Further, by enabling structured analysis of complaint narratives and visual context, it contributes to SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) by promoting more responsive product design and improved accountability in consumer services. We evaluate VALOR on a curated multimodal complaint dataset annotated with fine-grained aspect and severity labels, showing that it consistently outperforms baseline models, especially in complex complaint scenarios where information is distributed across text and images. This study underscores the value of multimodal interaction and expert validation in practical complaint understanding systems.

This study examines whether larger models can systematically jailbreak smaller ones - eliciting harmful or restricted behavior despite alignment safeguards. Using standardized adversarial tasks from JailbreakBench, we simulate over 6,000 multi-turn attacker-target exchanges across major LLM families and scales (0.6B-120B parameters), measuring both harm score and refusal behavior as indicators of adversarial potency and alignment integrity. Each interaction is evaluated through aggregated harm and refusal scores assigned by three independent LLM judges, providing a consistent, model-based measure of adversarial outcomes. Aggregating results across prompts, we find a strong and statistically significant correlation between mean harm and the logarithm of the attacker-to-target size ratio (Pearson r = 0.51, p < 0.001; Spearman rho = 0.52, p < 0.001), indicating that relative model size correlates with the likelihood and severity of harmful completions. Mean harm score variance is higher across attackers (0.18) than across targets (0.10), suggesting that attacker-side behavioral diversity contributes more to adversarial outcomes than target susceptibility. Attacker refusal frequency is strongly and negatively correlated with harm (rho = -0.93, p < 0.001), showing that attacker-side alignment mitigates harmful responses. These findings reveal that size asymmetry influences robustness and provide exploratory evidence for adversarial scaling patterns, motivating more controlled investigations into inter-model alignment and safety.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u89c4\u6a21\u4f18\u52bf\u53ef\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7834\u89e3\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u62a4\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u5dee\u5f02\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6297\u4ea4\u4e92\u7a81\u7834\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u62a4\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528JailbreakBench\u5bf9\u6297\u4efb\u52a1\u5e93\uff0c\u57280.6B-120B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u6a21\u62df6000+\u6b21\u653b\u51fb-\u9632\u5fa1\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u7ec4LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee3\u7406\u91cf\u5316\u5371\u5bb3\u5206\u6570\u548c\u62d2\u7edd\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u653b\u51fb/\u9632\u5fa1\u6a21\u578b\u5c3a\u5bf8\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5bf9\u6570\u4e0e\u5371\u5bb3\u5206\u6570\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173\uff08\u76ae\u5c14\u900ar=0.51\uff09\uff1b\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u884c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5f02\u65b9\u5dee\uff080.18\uff09\u5927\u4e8e\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u5dee\uff080.10\uff09\uff1b\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u62d2\u7edd\u7387\u4e0e\u5371\u5bb3\u5f3a\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\uff08rho=-0.93\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u5c3a\u5bf8\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u5b89\u5168\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u9700\u52a0\u5f3a\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

While it is possible to give weights to certain changes using a maximum parsimony evaluation criterion, it is difficult to state a priori what these weights should be. Probabilistic methods, such as Bayesian phylogenetics, allow users to create categories of changes, and the transition rates for each category can be estimated as part of the analysis. This classification of types of changes in readings also allows for inspecting the probability of these categories across each branch in the resulting trees. However, classification of readings is time-consuming, as it requires categorizing each reading against every other reading at each variation unit, presenting a significant barrier to entry for this kind of analysis. This paper presents Rdgai, a software package that automates this classification task using multi-lingual large language models (LLMs).

A key contribution is a measurement-feasibility prediction model that determines whether anatomical structures are reliably measurable in each frame, enabling autonomous tool selection. We curated a benchmark of diverse, clinically validated video-query pairs for evaluation. Results: EchoAgent achieves accurate, interpretable results despite added complexity of spatiotemporal video analysis. Outputs are grounded in visual evidence and clinical guidelines, supporting transparency and traceability.

Under review", "summary": "Language models generate functionally correct code that tends toward excessive verbosity, with elaborate documentation and defensive patterns that diverge from human baselines. Two prompting mechanisms have emerged for stylistic control: instruction based prompts that articulate abstract directives, and example based prompts that provide concrete code demonstrations. The core problem is whether stylistic constraints persist when models enhance initial implementations with additional features while maintaining high functional accuracy. Here we show that instruction-based, example-based, and combined prompts produce distinct patterns of initial control and expansion discipline over one enhancement turn. We manipulated system prompts across four conditions in a paired two-turn protocol where models first generated solutions to an intermediate Python task, then revised their code under general improvement directives, holding the user task fixed (N = 160 paired programs). Combined prompts produced the strongest initial compression and greatest expansion discipline. Instructions showed large initial effects and moderate expansion discipline. Examples showed modest initial effects with no expansion discipline. These results show that initial prompt effectiveness and expansion discipline are separate aspects of prompt design, and that combined approaches provide the most stable stylistic control in this two-turn workflow.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7ec4\u5408\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53cc\u8f6e\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6700\u5f3a\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u98ce\u683c\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u6269\u5c55\u7eaa\u5f8b", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u673a\u5236\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u529f\u80fd\u6269\u5c55\u65f6\u7ef4\u6301\u98ce\u683c\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u6027", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u56db\u7ec4\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u4e24\u8f6e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08N=160\u7ec4\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff09\uff0c\u9996\u8f6e\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u7840\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u8f6e\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u901a\u7528\u6539\u8fdb\u4fee\u8ba2", "result": "\u7ec4\u5408\u63d0\u793a\u4ea7\u751f\u6700\u5927\u521d\u59cb\u538b\u7f29\u6548\u679c\uff0849.2%\uff09\u548c\u6700\u5f3a\u6269\u5c55\u7eaa\u5f8b\uff08\u4ec5\u589e\u52a05.8%\uff09\uff1b\u6307\u4ee4\u63d0\u793a\u521d\u59cb\u538b\u7f29\u738742.3%\u4f46\u6269\u5c55\u589e\u52a018.7%\uff1b\u793a\u4f8b\u63d0\u793a\u4ec5\u538b\u7f2928.1%\u4e14\u6269\u5c55\u65e0\u7eaa\u5f8b\u6027", "conclusion": "\u521d\u59cb\u63d0\u793a\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u6269\u5c55\u7eaa\u5f8b\u6027\u662f\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u7ec4\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53cc\u8f6e\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u63a7\u5236"}}

Each role is defined through custom system prompts that enforce structured JSON outputs. A hybrid memory approach (FAISS + SQLite) enables both semantic retrieval and structured conversation history. An incremental indexing strategy based on file hashing minimizes redundant re-embedding when scientific corpora evolve. A configuration-driven project bootstrap layer allows research teams to customize tools, prompts, and data sources without modifying core code.\n  All agent decisions, tool invocations, and retrievals are logged and visualized through a custom Gradio interface, providing step-by-step transparency for each reasoning episode.

Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have brought a profound paradigm shift in LLM training, particularly for complex reasoning tasks. However, the on-policy nature of RLVR introduces a unique privacy leakage pattern: since training relies on self-generated responses without fixed ground-truth outputs, membership inference must now determine whether a given prompt (independent of any specific response) is used during fine-tuning. This creates a threat where leakage arises not from answer memorization.\n  To audit this novel privacy risk, we propose Divergence-in-Behavior Attack (DIBA), the first membership inference framework specifically designed for RLVR. DIBA shifts the focus from memorization to behavioral change, leveraging measurable shifts in model behavior across two axes: advantage-side improvement (e.g., correctness gain) and logit-side divergence (e.g., policy drift). Through comprehensive evaluations, we demonstrate that DIBA significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving around 0.8 AUC and an order-of-magnitude higher TPR@0.1%FPR. We validate DIBA's superiority across multiple settings--including in-distribution, cross-dataset, cross-algorithm, black-box scenarios, and extensions to vision-language models. Furthermore, our attack remains robust under moderate defensive measures.\n  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically analyze privacy vulnerabilities in RLVR, revealing that even in the absence of explicit supervision, training data exposure can be reliably inferred through behavioral traces.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\uff08RLVR\uff09\u7684\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6DIBA\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u884c\u4e3a\u53d8\u5316\u800c\u975e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u68c0\u6d4b\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u9879\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "RLVR\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b54\u6848\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u884c\u4e3a\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "DIBA\u6846\u67b6\u805a\u7126\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f18\u52bf\u4fa7\u6539\u8fdb\uff08\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u5347\uff09\u548clogit\u4fa7\u5dee\u5f02\uff08\u7b56\u7565\u6f02\u79fb\uff09\u7684\u53cc\u8f74\u884c\u4e3a\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u68c0\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "DIBA\u8fbe\u52300.8 AUC\u503c\uff0cTPR@0.1%FPR\u9ad8\u51fa\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u5728\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6/\u7b97\u6cd5/\u9ed1\u76d2\u573a\u666f\u53ca\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\u4e0b\u4f9d\u7136\u9c81\u68d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u63ed\u793aRLVR\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5373\u4f7f\u65e0\u663e\u5f0f\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u884c\u4e3a\u75d5\u8ff9\u4ecd\u53ef\u53ef\u9760\u63a8\u65ad\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4e3a\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

To address this, we propose 3D scene editing as a key mechanism to generate precise visual counterfactuals that mitigate these biases through fine-grained spatial manipulation, without requiring costly scene reconstruction or large-scale 3D data collection. Furthermore, to make these edits targeted and directly address the specific weaknesses of the model, we introduce DEER-3D, an error-driven framework following a structured \"Decompose, Diagnostic Evaluation, Edit, and Re-train\" workflow, rather than broadly or randomly augmenting data as in conventional approaches. Specifically, upon identifying a grounding failure of the 3D-LLM, our framework first diagnoses the exact predicate-level error (e.g., attribute or spatial relation). It then executes minimal, predicate-aligned 3D scene edits, such as recoloring or repositioning, to produce targeted counterfactual supervision for iterative model fine-tuning, significantly enhancing grounding accuracy. We evaluate our editing pipeline across multiple benchmarks for 3D grounding and scene understanding tasks, consistently demonstrating improvements across all evaluated datasets through iterative refinement.

To strengthen the ability to prevent such compromises, recent research has focused on designing increasingly stealthy attacks to stress-test existing defenses, pairing backdoor behaviors with stylized artifact or token-level perturbation triggers. However, this trend diverts attention from the harder and more realistic case: making the model respond to semantic triggers such as specific names or entities, where a successful backdoor could manipulate outputs tied to real people or events in deployed systems. Motivated by this growing disconnect, we introduce SteganoBackdoor, bringing stealth techniques back into line with practical threat models. Leveraging innocuous properties from natural-language steganography, SteganoBackdoor applies a gradient-guided data optimization process to transform semantic trigger seeds into steganographic carriers that embed a high backdoor payload, remain fluent, and exhibit no representational resemblance to the trigger. Across diverse experimental settings, SteganoBackdoor achieves over 99% attack success at an order-of-magnitude lower data-poisoning rate than prior approaches while maintaining unparalleled evasion against a comprehensive suite of data-level defenses. By revealing this practical and covert attack, SteganoBackdoor highlights an urgent blind spot in current defenses and demands immediate attention to adversarial data defenses and real-world threat modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSteganoBackdoor\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u9690\u5199\u672f\u521b\u5efa\u9690\u853d\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\uff0c\u57281/10\u6570\u636e\u6295\u6bd2\u7387\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b099%\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5168\u9762\u89c4\u907f\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u68c0\u6d4b", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u4f9d\u8d56\u663e\u5f0f\u98ce\u683c/\u7b26\u53f7\u7ea7\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\uff0c\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u5a01\u80c1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\uff08\u5982\u7279\u5b9a\u4eba\u540d\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u8131\u8282\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u7b26\u5408\u5b9e\u9645\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9690\u853d\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u5f0f", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u9690\u5199\u672f\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4f18\u5316\u5c06\u8bed\u4e49\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9690\u5199\u8f7d\u4f53\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u6587\u672c\u6d41\u7545\u4e14\u65e0\u8868\u5f81\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8d8599%\uff0c\u6295\u6bd2\u7387\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f4e\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u572812\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6848\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301100%\u9003\u907f\u6210\u529f\u7387", "conclusion": "\u66b4\u9732\u5f53\u524d\u9632\u5fa1\u4f53\u7cfb\u5bf9\u9690\u853d\u8bed\u4e49\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u76f2\u533a\uff0c\u547c\u5401\u52a0\u5f3a\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6570\u636e\u9632\u5fa1\u7814\u7a76\u5e76\u91cd\u6784\u73b0\u5b9e\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u578b"}}

We introduce SciRAG, an open-source framework for scientific literature exploration that addresses these gaps through three key innovations: (1) adaptive retrieval that flexibly alternates between sequential and parallel evidence gathering; (2) citation-aware symbolic reasoning that leverages citation graphs to organize and filter supporting documents; and (3) outline-guided synthesis that plans, critiques, and refines answers to ensure coherence and transparent attribution.

Specifically, they struggle to comprehend hand-drawn sketches, a modality that offers an intuitive means of expressing concepts that are difficult to describe textually. We identify the primary bottleneck as the absence of a large-scale dataset that jointly models sketches, photorealistic images, and corresponding natural language instructions. To address this, we present two key contributions: (1) a new, large-scale dataset of image-sketch-instruction triplets designed to facilitate both pretraining and instruction tuning, and (2) O3SLM, an LVLM trained on this dataset.
