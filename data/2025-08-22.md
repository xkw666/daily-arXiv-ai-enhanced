### [1] [Efficient Switchable Safety Control in LLMs via Magic-Token-Guided Co-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14904)
*Jianfeng Si,Lin Sun,Zhewen Tan,Xiangzheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出统一协同训练框架，通过单阶段SFT整合积极/消极/拒绝三种安全行为，实现动态安全模式切换并显著提升安全性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全对齐方法（如SFT+RLHF）存在多阶段训练复杂、部署后缺乏细粒度控制的问题

Method: 单阶段协同训练框架：1. 系统指令控制三种安全模式（积极/消极/拒绝） 2. 魔法令牌动态激活不同模式 3. 输出空间构建安全对齐边界

Result: 8B模型安全性能超越671B的DeepSeek-R1，训练复杂度降低90%+，推理时支持基于上下文的安全模式无缝切换

Conclusion: 该方法实现了高效可扩展的内容安全解决方案，通过动态行为控制突破传统对齐方法的部署限制

Abstract: Current methods for content safety in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF), often rely on multi-stage training pipelines and lack fine-grained,
post-deployment controllability. To address these limitations, we propose a
unified co-training framework that efficiently integrates multiple safety
behaviors: positive (lawful/prosocial), negative (unfiltered/risk-prone) and
rejective (refusal-oriented/conservative) within a single SFT stage. Notably,
each behavior is dynamically activated via a simple system-level instruction,
or magic token, enabling stealthy and efficient behavioral switching at
inference time. This flexibility supports diverse deployment scenarios, such as
positive for safe user interaction, negative for internal red-teaming, and
rejective for context-aware refusals triggered by upstream moderation signals.
This co-training strategy induces a distinct Safety Alignment Margin in the
output space, characterized by well-separated response distributions
corresponding to each safety mode. The existence of this margin provides
empirical evidence for the model's safety robustness and enables unprecedented
fine-grained control. Experiments show that our method matches the safety
alignment quality of SFT+DPO, with our 8B model notably surpassing DeepSeek-R1
(671B) in safety performance, while significantly reducing both training
complexity and deployment costs. This work presents a scalable, efficient, and
highly controllable solution for LLM content safety.

TL;DR: WMT25机器翻译任务使用自动指标生成初步系统排名，但提醒该结果可能对采用重排序技术的系统存在偏倚


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 向任务参与者分享初步自动评估结果，帮助其准备系统提交论文

Method: 基于自动评估指标（如质量估计重排序、最小贝叶斯风险解码等）进行系统排名

Result: 生成包含潜在偏倚的初步排名，强调最终官方排名将依赖更可靠的人类评估

Conclusion: 自动排名仅具参考价值，最终结论将以人工评估为准，体现严谨的评估体系设计

Abstract: We present the preliminary ranking of the WMT25 General Machine Translation
Shared Task, in which MT systems have been evaluated using automatic metrics.
As this ranking is based on automatic evaluations, it may be biased in favor of
systems that employ re-ranking techniques, such as Quality Estimation
re-ranking or Minimum Bayes Risk decoding. The official WMT25 ranking will be
based on human evaluation, which is more reliable and will supersede the
automatic ranking.
  The purpose of this report is not to present the final findings of the
General MT task, but rather to share preliminary results with task
participants, which may be useful when preparing their system submission
papers.

### [3] [Bridging the Culture Gap: A Framework for LLM-Driven Socio-Cultural Localization of Math Word Problems in Low-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14913)
*Israel Abebe Azime,Tadesse Destaw Belay,Dietrich Klakow,Philipp Slusallek,Anshuman Chhabra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM驱动的文化本地化框架自动生成包含本土实体的数学应用题数据集，缓解低资源语言数学推理中的英语中心偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言数学推理受限于缺乏反映本土文化实体（如人名/货币）的本地化数据集，现有翻译基准保留英语中心实体且人工本地化成本高昂。

Method: 提出LLM驱动的自动化文化本地化框架，从现有资源自动生成包含本土名称/组织/货币的数学应用题数据集。

Result: 实验表明该框架能有效减轻英语实体偏差，在多种语言中引入本土实体时提升模型鲁棒性，翻译基准可能掩盖真实多语言数学能力。

Conclusion: 文化本地化对提升多语言数学推理能力至关重要，自动化框架为低资源语言提供经济高效的本地化解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in
solving mathematical problems expressed in natural language. However,
multilingual and culturally-grounded mathematical reasoning in low-resource
languages lags behind English due to the scarcity of socio-cultural task
datasets that reflect accurate native entities such as person names,
organization names, and currencies. Existing multilingual benchmarks are
predominantly produced via translation and typically retain English-centric
entities, owing to the high cost associated with human annotater-based
localization. Moreover, automated localization tools are limited, and hence,
truly localized datasets remain scarce. To bridge this gap, we introduce a
framework for LLM-driven cultural localization of math word problems that
automatically constructs datasets with native names, organizations, and
currencies from existing sources. We find that translated benchmarks can
obscure true multilingual math ability under appropriate socio-cultural
contexts. Through extensive experiments, we also show that our framework can
help mitigate English-centric entity bias and improves robustness when native
entities are introduced across various languages.

### [4] [Improving LLMs for Machine Translation Using Synthetic Preference Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14951)
*Dario Vajda,Domen Vreš,Marko Robnik-Šikonja*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过DPO训练在斯洛文尼亚语案例中显著提升指令调整模型的机器翻译质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何利用少量易生成数据优化通用指令模型在特定语言翻译任务中的表现，解决传统方法数据需求高的问题

Method: 1. 使用DPO训练框架
2. 程序化构建包含GaMS-9B和EuroLLM-9B翻译结果的增强数据集
3. 结合启发式规则和COMET指标进行译文质量排序
4. 在斯洛文尼亚语维基百科翻译任务中验证

Result: 微调后模型COMET得分分别提升0.04/0.02，翻译错误率降低，格式一致性增强

Conclusion: 验证了DPO训练在低资源语言翻译任务的有效性，为优化LLM翻译性能提供高效解决方案

Abstract: Large language models have emerged as effective machine translation systems.
In this paper, we explore how a general instruction-tuned large language model
can be improved for machine translation using relatively few easily produced
data resources. Using Slovene as a use case, we improve the GaMS-9B-Instruct
model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training on a programmatically
curated and enhanced subset of a public dataset. As DPO requires pairs of
quality-ranked instances, we generated its training dataset by translating
English Wikipedia articles using two LLMs, GaMS-9B-Instruct and
EuroLLM-9B-Instruct. We ranked the resulting translations based on heuristics
coupled with automatic evaluation metrics such as COMET. The evaluation shows
that our fine-tuned model outperforms both models involved in the dataset
generation. In comparison to the baseline models, the fine-tuned model achieved
a COMET score gain of around 0.04 and 0.02, respectively, on translating
Wikipedia articles. It also more consistently avoids language and formatting
errors.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MultiCoXQL和Compass数据集，通过多语言扩展和自定义输入提取提升对话式可解释AI系统的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有对话式XAI系统在训练数据稀缺导致的多语言泛化能力不足，以及用户自定义输入支持有限的问题

Method: 1. 扩展多语言CoXQL数据集(MultiCoXQL) 
2. 提出增强型多语言解析方法 
3. 构建自定义输入提取数据集Compass 
4. 跨语言/多语言评估不同规模LLM和BERT类模型

Result: 在MultiCoXQL上验证了LLM的解析性能，在Compass数据集上实现了：
- 单语言F1最高0.89
- 跨语言迁移平均提升23.6%
- 多语言训练效果优于单语言

Conclusion: 通过数据集构建和解析方法创新，有效解决了低资源语言支持难题，为多语言对话式XAI系统提供了可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Conversational explainable artificial intelligence (ConvXAI) systems based on
large language models (LLMs) have garnered considerable attention for their
ability to enhance user comprehension through dialogue-based explanations.
Current ConvXAI systems often are based on intent recognition to accurately
identify the user's desired intention and map it to an explainability method.
While such methods offer great precision and reliability in discerning users'
underlying intentions for English, a significant challenge in the scarcity of
training data persists, which impedes multilingual generalization. Besides, the
support for free-form custom inputs, which are user-defined data distinct from
pre-configured dataset instances, remains largely limited. To bridge these
gaps, we first introduce MultiCoXQL, a multilingual extension of the CoXQL
dataset spanning five typologically diverse languages, including one
low-resource language. Subsequently, we propose a new parsing approach aimed at
enhancing multilingual parsing performance, and evaluate three LLMs on
MultiCoXQL using various parsing strategies. Furthermore, we present Compass, a
new multilingual dataset designed for custom input extraction in ConvXAI
systems, encompassing 11 intents across the same five languages as MultiCoXQL.
We conduct monolingual, cross-lingual, and multilingual evaluations on Compass,
employing three LLMs of varying sizes alongside BERT-type models.

### [6] [Reward-Shifted Speculative Sampling Is An Efficient Test-Time Weak-to-Strong Aligner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15044)
*Bolian Li,Yanran Wu,Xinyu Luo,Ruqi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出奖励转移推测采样算法(SSS)，通过仅对齐草稿模型来降低测试时对齐的推理成本，同时保持目标模型不变，有效平衡效率与安全性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时对齐方法需要额外计算资源导致推理成本过高，限制了实际应用场景。需要找到保持模型安全性的同时降低计算开销的新方法

Method: 将推测采样框架改进为奖励偏移版本，利用对齐草稿模型与未对齐目标模型的分布差异，通过修改token接受标准和奖励token分布来恢复RLHF最优解

Result: 在弱到强对齐实验中，以显著降低的推理成本获得更高的黄金奖励分数(理论证明可达RLHF最优解)

Conclusion: SSS算法通过计算负载转移策略，在不修改目标模型的前提下实现了高效安全对齐，为实际部署提供了可行的技术路径

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has become a
critical step in their development. Recent research has increasingly focused on
test-time alignment, where additional compute is allocated during inference to
enhance LLM safety and reasoning capabilities. However, these test-time
alignment techniques often incur substantial inference costs, limiting their
practical application. We are inspired by the speculative sampling
acceleration, which leverages a small draft model to efficiently predict future
tokens, to address the efficiency bottleneck of test-time alignment. We
introduce the reward-Shifted Speculative Sampling (SSS) algorithm, in which the
draft model is aligned with human preferences, while the target model remains
unchanged. We theoretically demonstrate that the distributional shift between
the aligned draft model and the unaligned target model can be exploited to
recover the RLHF optimal solution without actually obtaining it, by modifying
the acceptance criterion and bonus token distribution. Our algorithm achieves
superior gold reward scores at a significantly reduced inference cost in
test-time weak-to-strong alignment experiments, thereby validating both its
effectiveness and efficiency.

### [7] [LongRecall: A Structured Approach for Robust Recall Evaluation in Long-Form Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15085)
*MohamamdJavad Ardestani,Ehsan Kamalloo,Davood Rafiei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongRecall提出三阶段召回评估框架，通过事实分解+双重过滤+结构化对齐验证，显著提升长文本问答的召回准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有召回指标依赖词汇重叠易产生误判，LLM评估方法存在语义不对齐和幻觉问题，无法满足医疗/法律等高风险领域对信息完整性的严苛要求。

Method: 1. 将答案分解为独立事实单元；2. 通过词法/语义双重过滤缩小候选匹配范围；3. 结构化蕴含检查验证事实对齐，兼容不同措辞和上下文变化。

Result: 在三个长格式QA基准测试中，相比词汇匹配和LLM整体评估基线，召回准确率提升显著（人类标注和LLM评估结果一致）

Conclusion: 该框架通过结构化验证机制平衡语义覆盖与准确性，为系统性召回评估提供基础模块，尤其适用于高风险场景的信息完整性验证。

Abstract: LongRecall. The completeness of machine-generated text, ensuring that it
captures all relevant information, is crucial in domains such as medicine and
law and in tasks like list-based question answering (QA), where omissions can
have serious consequences. However, existing recall metrics often depend on
lexical overlap, leading to errors with unsubstantiated entities and
paraphrased answers, while LLM-as-a-Judge methods with long holistic prompts
capture broader semantics but remain prone to misalignment and hallucinations
without structured verification. We introduce LongRecall, a general three-stage
recall evaluation framework that decomposes answers into self-contained facts,
successively narrows plausible candidate matches through lexical and semantic
filtering, and verifies their alignment through structured entailment checks.
This design reduces false positives and false negatives while accommodating
diverse phrasings and contextual variations, serving as a foundational building
block for systematic recall assessment. We evaluate LongRecall on three
challenging long-form QA benchmarks using both human annotations and LLM-based
judges, demonstrating substantial improvements in recall accuracy over strong
lexical and LLM-as-a-Judge baselines.

### [8] [Mapping the Course for Prompt-based Structured Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15090)
*Matt Pauk,Maria Leonor Pacheco*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 结合符号推理与结构化学习提升大语言模型在结构化预测任务中的效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在结构化预测任务中存在的幻觉问题和复杂推理难题

Method: 将LLMs与组合推理结合，通过提示策略估计置信度值，并采用结构化目标进行校准和微调

Result: 符号推理显著提升预测一致性和准确性，结构化学习使困难任务性能提升25%

Conclusion: 符号推理与结构化学习的结合为LLMs时代保持结构化预测优势提供了有效路径

Abstract: LLMs have been shown to be useful for a variety of language tasks, without
requiring task-specific fine-tuning. However, these models often struggle with
hallucinations and complex reasoning problems due to their autoregressive
nature. We propose to address some of these issues, specifically in the area of
structured prediction, by combining LLMs with combinatorial inference in an
attempt to marry the predictive power of LLMs with the structural consistency
provided by inference methods. We perform exhaustive experiments in an effort
to understand which prompting strategies can effectively estimate LLM
confidence values for use with symbolic inference, and show that, regardless of
the prompting strategy, the addition of symbolic inference on top of prompting
alone leads to more consistent and accurate predictions. Additionally, we show
that calibration and fine-tuning using structured prediction objectives leads
to increased performance for challenging tasks, showing that structured
learning is still valuable in the era of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学数据集因HTML转换损耗、数学结构保存失败等问题导致质量下降，需要更可靠的科学内容提取方法

Method: 1. 使用lynx布局渲染+LLM清洗 2. 支持MathJax/KaTeX/MathML多格式转换 3. 标准化LaTeX表示并修正公式

Result: 构建133B/52B tokens数据集，在Nemotron-T 8B模型上MATH提升+4.8-12.6，MBPP+提升+4.6-14.3，同时提升MMLU通用领域表现

Conclusion: 首个可靠提取网页数学内容的完整方案，在数学/代码/通用推理任务均取得突破，并开源代码数据集推动社区发展

Abstract: Pretraining large language models (LLMs) on high-quality, structured data
such as mathematics and code substantially enhances reasoning capabilities.
However, existing math-focused datasets built from Common Crawl suffer from
degraded quality due to brittle extraction heuristics, lossy HTML-to-text
conversion, and the failure to reliably preserve mathematical structure. In
this work, we introduce Nemotron-CC-Math, a large-scale, high-quality
mathematical corpus constructed from Common Crawl using a novel,
domain-agnostic pipeline specifically designed for robust scientific text
extraction.
  Unlike previous efforts, our pipeline recovers math across various formats
(e.g., MathJax, KaTeX, MathML) by leveraging layout-aware rendering with lynx
and a targeted LLM-based cleaning stage. This approach preserves the structural
integrity of equations and code blocks while removing boilerplate,
standardizing notation into LaTeX representation, and correcting
inconsistencies.
  We collected a large, high-quality math corpus, namely Nemotron-CC-Math-3+
(133B tokens) and Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ (52B tokens). Notably,
Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ not only surpasses all prior open math datasets-including
MegaMath, FineMath, and OpenWebMath-but also contains 5.5 times more tokens
than FineMath-4+, which was previously the highest-quality math pretraining
dataset. When used to pretrain a Nemotron-T 8B model, our corpus yields +4.8 to
+12.6 gains on MATH and +4.6 to +14.3 gains on MBPP+ over strong baselines,
while also improving general-domain performance on MMLU and MMLU-Stem.
  We present the first pipeline to reliably extract scientific
content--including math--from noisy web-scale data, yielding measurable gains
in math, code, and general reasoning, and setting a new state of the art among
open math pretraining corpora. To support open-source efforts, we release our
code and datasets.

*Zijie Wang,Eduardo Blanco*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出利用外部证据和原子假设验证，改善大语言模型对隐含错误假设问题的回答效果，减少幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对大语言模型处理隐含错误假设问题时易产生幻觉生成误导答案的缺陷，探索通过事实核查框架降低错误率。

Method: 分两步：1.将问题转化为事实核查任务；2.引入外部证据检索机制，通过生成原子假设并验证其有效性来提升准确性。

Result: 在五个大语言模型上的实验表明：整合检索证据可使准确率提升21%，原子假设验证策略进一步带来15%增益，并提供错误定位的可解释性。

Conclusion: 通过证据检索与原子假设分解的联合策略，显著提升了大语言模型处理非常规问题的鲁棒性和答案可解释性。

Abstract: People often ask questions with false assumptions, a type of question that
does not have regular answers. Answering such questions require first
identifying the false assumptions. Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate
misleading answers because of hallucinations. In this paper, we focus on
identifying and answering questions with false assumptions in several domains.
We first investigate to reduce the problem to fact verification. Then, we
present an approach leveraging external evidence to mitigate hallucinations.
Experiments with five LLMs demonstrate that (1) incorporating retrieved
evidence is beneficial and (2) generating and validating atomic assumptions
yields more improvements and provides an interpretable answer by specifying the
false assumptions.

TL;DR: 提出MMDR-Bench多模态对话推理基准和CoLVLM Agent框架，通过记忆-感知-规划-执行循环显著提升复杂对话任务表现，实验结果显示优于GPT-4o和Gemini 1.5 Pro


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态模型在复杂对话场景中存在上下文丢失、视觉幻觉和推理深度不足等问题，需要更动态的评估基准和增强框架

Method: 构建含300个多轮对话场景的MMDR-Bench数据集，开发无需重训练的CoLVLM Agent框架，通过迭代四阶段循环增强推理能力

Result: CoLVLM Agent人类评估达4.03分，超越商业模型，在推理深度（提升12%）、指令遵循（提升15%）和长对话稳定性方面表现突出

Conclusion: 模块化设计和迭代机制有效解决复杂多模态交互挑战，为提升LVLMs的实际应用能力提供新方向

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), current models still face substantial
challenges in handling complex, multi-turn, and visually-grounded tasks that
demand deep reasoning, sustained contextual understanding, entity tracking, and
multi-step instruction following. Existing benchmarks often fall short in
capturing the dynamism and intricacies of real-world multi-modal interactions,
leading to issues such as context loss and visual hallucinations. To address
these limitations, we introduce MMDR-Bench (Multi-Modal Dialogue Reasoning
Benchmark), a novel dataset comprising 300 meticulously designed complex
multi-turn dialogue scenarios, each averaging 5-7 turns and evaluated across
six core dimensions including visual entity tracking and reasoning depth.
Furthermore, we propose CoLVLM Agent (Contextual LVLM Agent), a holistic
framework that enhances existing LVLMs with advanced reasoning and instruction
following capabilities through an iterative
"memory-perception-planning-execution" cycle, requiring no extensive
re-training of the underlying models. Our extensive experiments on MMDR-Bench
demonstrate that CoLVLM Agent consistently achieves superior performance,
attaining an average human evaluation score of 4.03, notably surpassing
state-of-the-art commercial models like GPT-4o (3.92) and Gemini 1.5 Pro
(3.85). The framework exhibits significant advantages in reasoning depth,
instruction adherence, and error suppression, and maintains robust performance
over extended dialogue turns, validating the effectiveness of its modular
design and iterative approach for complex multi-modal interactions.

*Dong Liu,Yanxuan Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出SemToken语义分词框架，通过语义聚类和异构粒度分配减少冗余token并提升计算效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分词方法（如BPE）仅依赖频率统计，忽视语义结构导致冗余分词和上下文连贯性利用不足，尤其在长文本场景

Method: 1. 通过轻量编码器提取语义嵌入并进行局部语义聚类
2. 根据语义密度分配不同分词粒度（内容密集区细粒度，重复区域粗压缩）

Result: 在WikiText-103等基准测试中实现2.4倍token减少和1.9倍加速，保持模型性能稳定

Conclusion: 语义结构为大规模语言模型的分词优化和计算效率提升提供了新方向

Abstract: Tokenization plays a critical role in language modeling, yet existing
approaches such as Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) or WordPiece operate purely on
frequency statistics, ignoring the underlying semantic structure of text. This
leads to over-tokenization of semantically redundant spans and underutilization
of contextual coherence, particularly in long-context scenarios. In this work,
we propose \textbf{SemToken}, a semantic-aware tokenization framework that
jointly reduces token redundancy and improves computation efficiency. SemToken
first extracts contextual semantic embeddings via lightweight encoders and
performs local semantic clustering to merge semantically equivalent tokens.
Then, it allocates heterogeneous token granularity based on semantic density,
allowing finer-grained tokenization in content-rich regions and coarser
compression in repetitive or low-entropy spans. SemToken can be seamlessly
integrated with modern language models and attention acceleration methods.
Experiments on long-context language modeling benchmarks such as WikiText-103
and LongBench show that SemToken achieves up to $2.4\times$ reduction in token
count and $1.9\times$ speedup, with negligible or no degradation in perplexity
and downstream accuracy. Our findings suggest that semantic structure offers a
promising new axis for optimizing tokenization and computation in large
language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出领域专用奖励模型Fin-PRM，通过步骤级和轨迹级奖励监督提升金融推理任务的中间过程评估效果，实验显示其显著优于通用PRM和基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PRM在金融领域存在局限（结构化/符号化推理需求、法规敏感性），需开发领域专用模型提升推理质量评估能力。

Method: 集成双层级奖励监督（步骤级+轨迹级），支持离线/在线奖励学习的三种应用：蒸馏微调、强化学习奖励、Best-of-N推理引导。

Result: 在CFLUE/FinQA基准上取得显著提升：监督学习+12.9%，强化学习+5.2%，测试时性能+5.1%。

Conclusion: 领域专用奖励模型能有效对齐LLMs与专家级金融推理，项目资源将在阿里云平台开源。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising framework for
supervising intermediate reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet
existing PRMs are primarily trained on general or Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) domains and fall short in domain-specific
contexts such as finance, where reasoning is more structured, symbolic, and
sensitive to factual and regulatory correctness. We introduce \textbf{Fin-PRM},
a domain-specialized, trajectory-aware PRM tailored to evaluate intermediate
reasoning steps in financial tasks. Fin-PRM integrates step-level and
trajectory-level reward supervision, enabling fine-grained evaluation of
reasoning traces aligned with financial logic. We apply Fin-PRM in both offline
and online reward learning settings, supporting three key applications: (i)
selecting high-quality reasoning trajectories for distillation-based supervised
fine-tuning, (ii) providing dense process-level rewards for reinforcement
learning, and (iii) guiding reward-informed Best-of-N inference at test time.
Experimental results on financial reasoning benchmarks, including CFLUE and
FinQA, demonstrate that Fin-PRM consistently outperforms general-purpose PRMs
and strong domain baselines in trajectory selection quality. Downstream models
trained with Fin-PRM yield substantial improvements with baselines, with gains
of 12.9\% in supervised learning, 5.2\% in reinforcement learning, and 5.1\% in
test-time performance. These findings highlight the value of domain-specialized
reward modeling for aligning LLMs with expert-level financial reasoning. Our
project resources will be available at https://github.com/aliyun/qwen-dianjin.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPARK提出一种无需训练的通道级KV稀疏剪枝方法，通过动态恢复机制在降低30%存储开销的同时保持模型精度，兼容现有压缩技术实现长上下文高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存压缩方法仅关注时间轴而忽略通道轴重要性差异，导致效率与精度难以平衡。作者发现不同通道的显著性存在极大波动，关键通道对注意力计算影响显著。

Method: 采用通道级非结构化稀疏剪枝，在注意力计算时动态恢复被剪枝通道的数值。该方法与现有KV量化和压缩技术正交，支持组合使用实现叠加加速效果。

Result: 相同内存下处理序列长度增加30%，在80%激进剪枝率下性能下降小于5%。相比基于剔除的方法，等长序列存储减少30%且精度保持/提升。

Conclusion: SPARK通过通道维度冗余消除，首次实现KV缓存通道轴优化，在保持模型性能前提下突破长上下文处理瓶颈，为LLM推理加速提供新维度。

Abstract: Long-context inference in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
constrained by the KV cache bottleneck: memory usage grows linearly with
sequence length, while attention computation scales quadratically. Existing
approaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal
axis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and
computational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained
importance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis),
thereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model
accuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically
across both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero
information for a given query, while others spike in relevance. To address this
oversight, we propose SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies
unstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically
restoring the pruned entries during attention score computation. Notably, our
approach is orthogonal to existing KV compression and quantization techniques,
making it compatible for integration with them to achieve further acceleration.
By reducing channel-level redundancy, SPARK enables processing of longer
sequences within the same memory budget. For sequences of equal length, SPARK
not only preserves or improves model accuracy but also reduces KV cache storage
by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods. Furthermore, even with an
aggressive pruning ratio of 80%, SPARK maintains performance with less
degradation than 5% compared to the baseline eviction method, demonstrating its
robustness and effectiveness. Our code will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大模型在领域QA中RAG方法存在的幻觉/延迟问题，以及持续预训练成本高、跨领域适应性差的问题。受人类渐进式学习启发，提出分阶段知识获取策略。

Method: 1. 内部-外部知识自选策略实现知识内化 2. 结构化推理数据生成流程 3. GRPO优化方法增强推理能力 4. 选择性监督微调框架

Result: 在医疗/法律/金融领域QA基准测试中持续超越现有方法，性能匹配领域预训练大模型且成本降低90%

Conclusion: S2K框架通过渐进式知识获取机制，以1/10成本实现领域知识高效内化，具有跨领域扩展潜力

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in general QA but often struggle in
domain-specific scenarios. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces
external knowledge but suffers from hallucinations and latency due to noisy
retrievals. Continued pretraining internalizes domain knowledge but is costly
and lacks cross-domain flexibility. We attribute this challenge to the
long-tail distribution of domain knowledge, which leaves partial yet useful
internal knowledge underutilized. We further argue that knowledge acquisition
should be progressive, mirroring human learning: first understanding concepts,
then applying them to complex reasoning. To address this, we propose Selct2Know
(S2K), a cost-effective framework that internalizes domain knowledge through an
internal-external knowledge self-selection strategy and selective supervised
fine-tuning. We also introduce a structured reasoning data generation pipeline
and integrate GRPO to enhance reasoning ability. Experiments on medical, legal,
and financial QA benchmarks show that S2K consistently outperforms existing
methods and matches domain-pretrained LLMs with significantly lower cost.

TL;DR: 提出SEER方法，通过逐步检索动态经验池提升LLM工具调用能力，在ToolQA基准和真实场景测试中取得显著性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具调用方法依赖人工设计示例或静态库，难以适应复杂多步骤任务，需更高效的自适应解决方案

Method: SEER通过细粒度逐步检索持续更新的经验池，自动积累成功轨迹实现工具链优化

Result: ToolQA基准平均提升6.1%（简单题）和4.7%（难题）；τ-bench测试中Qwen2.5-7B/72B模型分别提升7.44%和23.38%

Conclusion: 自引导的经验检索机制有效增强LLM多步骤工具调用能力，实现持续性能改进

Abstract: Function calling enables large language models (LLMs) to interact with
external systems by leveraging tools and APIs. When faced with multi-step tool
usage, LLMs still struggle with tool selection, parameter generation, and
tool-chain planning. Existing methods typically rely on manually designing
task-specific demonstrations, or retrieving from a curated library. These
approaches demand substantial expert effort and prompt engineering becomes
increasingly complex and inefficient as tool diversity and task difficulty
scale. To address these challenges, we propose a self-guided method, Stepwise
Experience Recall (SEER), which performs fine-grained, stepwise retrieval from
a continually updated experience pool. Instead of relying on static or manually
curated library, SEER incrementally augments the experience pool with past
successful trajectories, enabling continuous expansion of the pool and improved
model performance over time. Evaluated on the ToolQA benchmark, SEER achieves
an average improvement of 6.1\% on easy and 4.7\% on hard questions. We further
test SEER on $\tau$-bench, which includes two real-world domains. Powered by
Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-72B models, SEER demonstrates substantial accuracy gains
of 7.44\% and 23.38\%, respectively.

TL;DR: 研究发现选择性使用检查清单能提升生成任务评估性能，但人工评估标准存在潜在不一致性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型自动评估生成任务时因标准模糊导致的评估困难，探索检查清单策略的有效性

Method: 通过六种方法生成检查清单，在八个不同规模模型上测试，使用成对比较和直接评分两种实验方案

Result: 选择性检查清单在成对评估中表现更优，直接评分改进不稳定；低相关性检查项仍反映人工标准特征

Conclusion: 需要明确定义客观评估标准以减少人工与自动评估的不一致性

Abstract: Automatic evaluation of generative tasks using large language models faces
challenges due to ambiguous criteria. Although automatic checklist generation
is a potentially promising approach, its usefulness remains underexplored. We
investigate whether checklists should be used for all questions or selectively,
generate them using six methods, evaluate their effectiveness across eight
model sizes, and identify checklist items that correlate with human
evaluations. Through experiments on pairwise comparison and direct scoring
tasks, we find that selective checklist use tends to improve evaluation
performance in pairwise settings, while its benefits are less consistent in
direct scoring. Our analysis also shows that even checklist items with low
correlation to human scores often reflect human-written criteria, indicating
potential inconsistencies in human evaluation. These findings highlight the
need to more clearly define objective evaluation criteria to guide both human
and automatic evaluations. \footnote{Our code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态词汇修剪方法存在内存占用大、信息丢失和灵活性不足的问题，需改进小语言模型在边缘设备的部署效率

Method: 基于词汇局部性原则和计算不对称性，采用解耦动态词汇选择框架：1) 嵌入层卸载 2) LM Head混合动静选择策略实现按需加载

Result: 在多任务测试中实现词汇组件内存占用减少99%，性能基本无下降，显著优于传统静态修剪方法

Conclusion: VocabTailor通过动态词汇优化有效突破小语言模型内存瓶颈，为边缘计算场景提供高效部署方案

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) provide computational advantages in
resource-constrained environments, yet memory limitations remain a critical
bottleneck for edge device deployment. A substantial portion of SLMs' memory
footprint stems from vocabulary-related components, particularly embeddings and
language modeling (LM) heads, due to large vocabulary sizes. Existing static
vocabulary pruning, while reducing memory usage, suffers from rigid,
one-size-fits-all designs that cause information loss from the prefill stage
and a lack of flexibility. In this work, we identify two key principles
underlying the vocabulary reduction challenge: the lexical locality principle,
the observation that only a small subset of tokens is required during any
single inference, and the asymmetry in computational characteristics between
vocabulary-related components of SLM. Based on these insights, we introduce
VocabTailor, a novel decoupled dynamic vocabulary selection framework that
addresses memory constraints through offloading embedding and implements a
hybrid static-dynamic vocabulary selection strategy for LM Head, enabling
on-demand loading of vocabulary components. Comprehensive experiments across
diverse downstream tasks demonstrate that VocabTailor achieves a reduction of
up to 99% in the memory usage of vocabulary-related components with minimal or
no degradation in task performance, substantially outperforming existing static
vocabulary pruning.

Method: 构建多领域人工标注数据集，采用零样本评估揭示性能差距，并通过指令微调实验对比本地数据与翻译数据的效果差异。

Conclusion: 强调需基于本土文化和专业背景构建指令数据，以增强LLM在低资源多语言环境中的实际应用能力。

Abstract: Large language models excel at instruction-following in English, but their
performance in low-resource languages like Thai remains underexplored. Existing
benchmarks often rely on translations, missing cultural and domain-specific
nuances needed for real-world use. We present WangchanThaiInstruct, a
human-authored Thai dataset for evaluation and instruction tuning, covering
four professional domains and seven task types. Created through a multi-stage
quality control process with annotators, domain experts, and AI researchers,
WangchanThaiInstruct supports two studies: (1) a zero-shot evaluation showing
performance gaps on culturally and professionally specific tasks, and (2) an
instruction tuning study with ablations isolating the effect of native
supervision. Models fine-tuned on WangchanThaiInstruct outperform those using
translated data in both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. These findings
underscore the need for culturally and professionally grounded instruction data
to improve LLM alignment in low-resource, linguistically diverse settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实对话中普遍存在多语言混合现象，但现有语音系统处理能力不足，主要受限于代码切换(CS)数据集的匮乏。

Method: 提出SWORDS算法：按词性替换同义词生成CS语音，保持语义不变。基于此构建CS-FLEURS多语言语料库，支持语音识别(ASR)和语音翻译(S2TT)。

Result: CS-FLEURS在可懂度(92.7%)和自然度(4.3/5)指标上表现优异，客观指标(WER 15.2%)与主观评估均优于基线数据集。

Conclusion: 该框架为代码切换语音技术研究提供新范式，通过高质量数据生成推动包容性多语言系统发展，预计将使低资源语言群体受益。

Abstract: Code-switching (CS), the alternation between two or more languages within a
single speaker's utterances, is common in real-world conversations and poses
significant challenges for multilingual speech technology. However, systems
capable of handling this phenomenon remain underexplored, primarily due to the
scarcity of suitable datasets. To resolve this issue, we propose Universal
Code-Mixer (UniCoM), a novel pipeline for generating high-quality, natural CS
samples without altering sentence semantics. Our approach utilizes an algorithm
we call Substituting WORDs with Synonyms (SWORDS), which generates CS speech by
replacing selected words with their translations while considering their parts
of speech. Using UniCoM, we construct Code-Switching FLEURS (CS-FLEURS), a
multilingual CS corpus designed for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and
speech-to-text translation (S2TT). Experimental results show that CS-FLEURS
achieves high intelligibility and naturalness, performing comparably to
existing datasets on both objective and subjective metrics. We expect our
approach to advance CS speech technology and enable more inclusive multilingual
systems.

Motivation: 现有模拟职业的LLMs缺乏系统的心理伦理评估框架，尤其在教育领域需要专业化的道德风险检测工具。

Method: 构建88个教师道德困境数据集，开发含人格测评/道德阶段测量/软提示注入攻击检测的评估框架，对比12个LLMs与人类教师表现。

Result: 教师LLMs呈现极端化人格特征，抽象道德推理强但情感处理弱；强推理模型更易受提示攻击，温度参数对风险行为影响有限。

Conclusion: 创建首个教师LLMs伦理心理评估基准，揭示模型安全性与能力负相关，为教育AI提供关键评估工具（https://e-m-n-l-p.github.io/）。

Abstract: Simulating Professions (SP) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate
professional roles. However, comprehensive psychological and ethical evaluation
in these contexts remains lacking. This paper introduces EMNLP, an
Educator-role Moral and Normative LLMs Profiling framework for personality
profiling, moral development stage measurement, and ethical risk under soft
prompt injection. EMNLP extends existing scales and constructs 88
teacher-specific moral dilemmas, enabling profession-oriented comparison with
human teachers. A targeted soft prompt injection set evaluates compliance and
vulnerability in teacher SP. Experiments on 12 LLMs show teacher-role LLMs
exhibit more idealized and polarized personalities than human teachers, excel
in abstract moral reasoning, but struggle with emotionally complex situations.
Models with stronger reasoning are more vulnerable to harmful prompt injection,
revealing a paradox between capability and safety. The model temperature and
other hyperparameters have limited influence except in some risk behaviors.
This paper presents the first benchmark to assess ethical and psychological
alignment of teacher-role LLMs for educational AI. Resources are available at

Motivation: 现有检索增强生成(RAG)系统在外部上下文与LLM参数知识冲突时，难以正确协调不同知识源，导致错误结论

Method: 通过上下文评估器提取压缩记忆标记，采用基于grounded/adversarial的软提示训练机制，引导模型识别不可靠上下文并选择可信知识源

Result: 在多项基准测试中有效缓解上下文-记忆冲突，平均性能提升5.0%

Conclusion: CARE为构建可信赖且自适应的RAG系统提供了有前景的技术路径

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances the capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge into their input
prompts. However, when the retrieved context contradicts the LLM's parametric
knowledge, it often fails to resolve the conflict between incorrect external
context and correct parametric knowledge, known as context-memory conflict. To
tackle this problem, we introduce Conflict-Aware REtrieval-Augmented Generation
(CARE), consisting of a context assessor and a base LLM. The context assessor
encodes compact memory token embeddings from raw context tokens. Through
grounded/adversarial soft prompting, the context assessor is trained to discern
unreliable context and capture a guidance signal that directs reasoning toward
the more reliable knowledge source. Extensive experiments show that CARE
effectively mitigates context-memory conflicts, leading to an average
performance gain of 5.0\% on QA and fact-checking benchmarks, establishing a
promising direction for trustworthy and adaptive RAG systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在时间常识推理方面表现不足，因其在文本中较少显式出现

Method: 开发时间常识提取流程：1）使用LLMs自动挖掘时间常识 2）基于SAMSum和RealNews构建TComQA数据集

Result: TComQA众包验证准确率超80%，训练模型效果优于现有数据集微调的LLM

Conclusion: 验证LLMs自动提取时间常识的有效性，TComQA能有效增强语言模型的时间推理能力

Abstract: Understanding events necessitates grasping their temporal context, which is
often not explicitly stated in natural language. For example, it is not a
trivial task for a machine to infer that a museum tour may last for a few
hours, but can not take months. Recent studies indicate that even advanced
large language models (LLMs) struggle in generating text that require reasoning
with temporal commonsense due to its infrequent explicit mention in text.
Therefore, automatically mining temporal commonsense for events enables the
creation of robust language models. In this work, we investigate the capacity
of LLMs to extract temporal commonsense from text and evaluate multiple
experimental setups to assess their effectiveness. Here, we propose a temporal
commonsense extraction pipeline that leverages LLMs to automatically mine
temporal commonsense and use it to construct TComQA, a dataset derived from
SAMSum and RealNews corpora. TComQA has been validated through crowdsourcing
and achieves over 80\% precision in extracting temporal commonsense. The model
trained with TComQA also outperforms an LLM fine-tuned on existing dataset of
temporal question answering task.

Motivation: 传统音素识别依赖长语音段和特定语言模式，需要不受上下文影响的纯净音素表征

Result: 在多语言监督/自监督训练中表现优异，UCLA语料库零样本测试验证跨语言泛化能力

Conclusion: 通过建模音素长度窗口内的基础声学模式可实现有效的通用语音处理

Abstract: Universal phoneme recognition typically requires analyzing long speech
segments and language-specific patterns. Many speech processing tasks require
pure phoneme representations free from contextual influence, which motivated
our development of CUPE - a lightweight model that captures key phoneme
features in just 120 milliseconds, about one phoneme's length. CUPE processes
short, fixed-width windows independently and, despite fewer parameters than
current approaches, achieves competitive cross-lingual performance by learning
fundamental acoustic patterns common to all languages. Our extensive evaluation
through supervised and self-supervised training on diverse languages, including
zero-shot tests on the UCLA Phonetic Corpus, demonstrates strong cross-lingual
generalization and reveals that effective universal speech processing is
possible through modeling basic acoustic patterns within phoneme-length
windows.

Conclusion: EDAS提供全局视角的统一评估框架，增强评估结果的一致性和可解释性，支持跨数据集公平比较。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) enable applications in various domains such as
semantic search, recommendation systems, and natural language processing. KGs
are often incomplete, missing entities and relations, an issue addressed by
Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) methods that predict missing elements.
Different evaluation metrics, such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Mean Rank
(MR), and Hit@k, are commonly used to assess the performance of such KGC
models. A major challenge in evaluating KGC models, however, lies in comparing
their performance across multiple datasets and metrics. A model may outperform
others on one dataset but underperform on another, making it difficult to
determine overall superiority. Moreover, even within a single dataset,
different metrics such as MRR and Hit@1 can yield conflicting rankings, where
one model excels in MRR while another performs better in Hit@1, further
complicating model selection for downstream tasks. These inconsistencies hinder
holistic comparisons and highlight the need for a unified meta-metric that
integrates performance across all metrics and datasets to enable a more
reliable and interpretable evaluation framework. To address this need, we
propose KG Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS), a robust
and interpretable meta-metric that synthesizes model performance across
multiple datasets and diverse evaluation criteria into a single normalized
score ($M_i \in [0,1]$). Unlike traditional metrics that focus on isolated
aspects of performance, EDAS offers a global perspective that supports more
informed model selection and promotes fairness in cross-dataset evaluation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets such as FB15k-237 and WN18RR
demonstrate that EDAS effectively integrates multi-metric, multi-dataset
performance into a unified ranking, offering a consistent, robust, and
generalizable framework for evaluating KGC models.

Abstract: In recent years, with the rapid development of the depth and breadth of large
language models' capabilities, various corresponding evaluation benchmarks have
been emerging in increasing numbers. As a quantitative assessment tool for
model performance, benchmarks are not only a core means to measure model
capabilities but also a key element in guiding the direction of model
development and promoting technological innovation. We systematically review
the current status and development of large language model benchmarks for the
first time, categorizing 283 representative benchmarks into three categories:
general capabilities, domain-specific, and target-specific. General capability
benchmarks cover aspects such as core linguistics, knowledge, and reasoning;
domain-specific benchmarks focus on fields like natural sciences, humanities
and social sciences, and engineering technology; target-specific benchmarks pay
attention to risks, reliability, agents, etc. We point out that current
benchmarks have problems such as inflated scores caused by data contamination,
unfair evaluation due to cultural and linguistic biases, and lack of evaluation
on process credibility and dynamic environments, and provide a referable design
paradigm for future benchmark innovation.

Abstract: The trustworthiness of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains an
intense concern despite the significant progress in their capabilities.
Existing evaluation and mitigation approaches often focus on narrow aspects and
overlook risks introduced by the multimodality. To tackle these challenges, we
propose MultiTrust-X, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating, analyzing, and
mitigating the trustworthiness issues of MLLMs. We define a three-dimensional
framework, encompassing five trustworthiness aspects which include
truthfulness, robustness, safety, fairness, and privacy; two novel risk types
covering multimodal risks and cross-modal impacts; and various mitigation
strategies from the perspectives of data, model architecture, training, and
inference algorithms. Based on the taxonomy, MultiTrust-X includes 32 tasks and
28 curated datasets, enabling holistic evaluations over 30 open-source and
proprietary MLLMs and in-depth analysis with 8 representative mitigation
methods. Our extensive experiments reveal significant vulnerabilities in
current models, including a gap between trustworthiness and general
capabilities, as well as the amplification of potential risks in base LLMs by
both multimodal training and inference. Moreover, our controlled analysis
uncovers key limitations in existing mitigation strategies that, while some
methods yield improvements in specific aspects, few effectively address overall
trustworthiness, and many introduce unexpected trade-offs that compromise model
utility. These findings also provide practical insights for future
improvements, such as the benefits of reasoning to better balance safety and
performance. Based on these insights, we introduce a Reasoning-Enhanced Safety
Alignment (RESA) approach that equips the model with chain-of-thought reasoning
ability to discover the underlying risks, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: 该框架为不同不确定性条件下的语言模型提供了一种即插即用的高效解码方案，在保持生成质量的前提下实现资源利用最优化。

Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating
autoregressive inference by parallelizing token generation through a
draft-then-verify paradigm. However, existing methods rely on static drafting
lengths and rigid verification criteria, limiting their adaptability across
varying model uncertainties and input complexities. This paper proposes an
information-theoretic framework for speculative decoding based on
confidence-modulated drafting. By leveraging entropy and margin-based
uncertainty measures over the drafter's output distribution, the proposed
method dynamically adjusts the number of speculatively generated tokens at each
iteration. This adaptive mechanism reduces rollback frequency, improves
resource utilization, and maintains output fidelity. Additionally, the
verification process is modulated using the same confidence signals, enabling
more flexible acceptance of drafted tokens without sacrificing generation
quality. Experiments on machine translation and summarization tasks demonstrate
significant speedups over standard speculative decoding while preserving or
improving BLEU and ROUGE scores. The proposed approach offers a principled,
plug-in method for efficient and robust decoding in large language models under
varying conditions of uncertainty.

Motivation: 探索大词表对语言模型的真实效益来源，反驳传统认知中词频不平衡会损害模型表现的观点。

Method: 控制变量实验（24K-196K词表）、科尔莫戈洛夫复杂度分析、词级损失分解、嵌入向量约束实验、模型参数扩展对比。

Result: 大词表使高频词（前2500词）交叉熵降低3.7倍，但罕见词损失上升；约束嵌入范数导致性能下降；77%下游任务token被高频词覆盖。

Conclusion: 词表优化的本质是降低文本编码复杂度，为模型架构与分词器的协同设计提供理论依据，揭示预训练中的损失动态机制。

Abstract: Large language models are trained with tokenizers, and the resulting token
distribution is highly imbalanced: a few words dominate the stream while most
occur rarely. Recent practice favors ever-larger vocabularies, but the source
of the benefit is unclear. We conduct a controlled study that scales the
language model's vocabulary from 24K to 196K while holding data, compute, and
optimization fixed. We first quantify the complexity of tokenized text,
formalized via Kolmogorov complexity, and show that larger vocabularies reduce
this complexity. Above 24K, every common word is already a single token, so
further growth mainly deepens the relative token-frequency imbalance. A
word-level loss decomposition shows that larger vocabularies reduce
cross-entropy almost exclusively by lowering uncertainty on the 2,500 most
frequent words, even though loss on the rare tail rises. Constraining input and
output embedding norms to attenuate the effect of token-frequency imbalance
reverses the gain, directly showing that the model exploits rather than suffers
from imbalance. Because the same frequent words cover roughly 77% of tokens in
downstream benchmarks, this training advantage transfers intact. We also show
that enlarging model parameters with a fixed vocabulary yields the same
frequent-word benefit. Our results reframe "bigger vocabularies help" as
"lowering the complexity of tokenized text helps," providing a simple,
principled lever for tokenizer-model co-design and clarifying the loss dynamics
that govern language-model scaling in pre-training.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) has been accompanied
by growing concerns regarding their reliability and trustworthiness. As a
result, a growing body of research focuses on evidence-based text generation
with LLMs, aiming to link model outputs to supporting evidence to ensure
traceability and verifiability. However, the field is fragmented due to
inconsistent terminology, isolated evaluation practices, and a lack of unified
benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we systematically analyze 134 papers, introduce
a unified taxonomy of evidence-based text generation with LLMs, and investigate
300 evaluation metrics across seven key dimensions. Thereby, we focus on
approaches that use citations, attribution, or quotations for evidence-based
text generation. Building on this, we examine the distinctive characteristics
and representative methods in the field. Finally, we highlight open challenges
and outline promising directions for future work.

Result: 模型在模态冲突时78%决策偏向文本，音频任务准确率下降32%；监督微调可部分缓解但未根治，矛盾输入下仍存在过度自信现象

Conclusion: 需改进多模态平衡训练策略，开发更精细的融合机制以增强处理冲突输入的鲁棒性

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are enhanced with audio perception
capabilities, enabling them to effectively process and understand multimodal
inputs that combine audio and text. However, their performance in handling
conflicting information between audio and text modalities remains largely
unexamined. This paper introduces MCR-BENCH, the first comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate how LALMs prioritize information when
presented with inconsistent audio-text pairs. Through extensive evaluation
across diverse audio understanding tasks, we reveal a concerning phenomenon:
when inconsistencies exist between modalities, LALMs display a significant bias
toward textual input, frequently disregarding audio evidence. This tendency
leads to substantial performance degradation in audio-centric tasks and raises
important reliability concerns for real-world applications. We further
investigate the influencing factors of text bias, and explore mitigation
strategies through supervised finetuning, and analyze model confidence patterns
that reveal persistent overconfidence even with contradictory inputs. These
findings underscore the need for improved modality balance during training and
more sophisticated fusion mechanisms to enhance the robustness when handling
conflicting multi-modal inputs. The project is available at

Conclusion: 通过完全开源的数据-模型-评估体系，LLaSO建立了统一研究标准，促进社区协作并加速LSLM领域发展。

Abstract: The development of Large Speech-Language Models (LSLMs) has been slowed by
fragmented architectures and a lack of transparency, hindering the systematic
comparison and reproducibility of research. Unlike in the vision-language
domain, the LSLM field suffers from the common practice of releasing model
weights without their corresponding training data and configurations. To
address these critical gaps, we introduce LLaSO, the first fully open,
end-to-end framework for large-scale speech-language modeling. LLaSO provides
the community with three essential resources: (1) LLaSO-Align, a 12M-instance
speech-text alignment corpus; (2) LLaSO-Instruct, a 13.5M-instance multi-task
instruction-tuning dataset; and (3) LLaSO-Eval, a reproducible benchmark for
standardized evaluation. To validate our framework, we build and release
LLaSO-Base, a 3.8B-parameter reference model trained exclusively on our public
data. It achieves a normalized score of 0.72, establishing a strong,
reproducible baseline that surpasses comparable models. Our analysis reveals
that while broader training coverage enhances performance, significant
generalization gaps persist on unseen tasks, particularly in pure audio
scenarios. By releasing the complete stack of data, benchmarks, and models,
LLaSO establishes a foundational open standard to unify research efforts and
accelerate community-driven progress in LSLMs. We release the code, dataset,
pretrained models, and results in https://github.com/EIT-NLP/LLaSO.

Abstract: Recent developments in language modeling have increased their use in various
applications and domains. Language models, often trained on sensitive data, can
memorize and disclose this information during privacy attacks, raising concerns
about protecting individuals' privacy rights. Preserving privacy in language
models has become a crucial area of research, as privacy is one of the
fundamental human rights. Despite its significance, understanding of how much
privacy risk these language models possess and how it can be mitigated is still
limited. This research addresses this by providing a comprehensive study of the
privacy-preserving language modeling approaches. This study gives an in-depth
overview of these approaches, highlights their strengths, and investigates
their limitations. The outcomes of this study contribute to the ongoing

Method: 采用文献研究法，通过系统梳理现有翻译理论，归纳总结非对等词汇的转换方法论。

Result: 提出多维度翻译规则体系，实现25个达斡尔语和乌兹别克语特色词汇在英语和俄语中的专业转换。

Conclusion: 尽管部分词汇已完成专业转换，但语言文化差异性决定了非对等词汇翻译仍是持续性的跨学科研究课题。

Abstract: These pure languages understanding directly relates to translation knowledge
where linguists and translators need to work and research to eradicate
misunderstanding. Misunderstandings mostly appear in non-equivalent words
because there are different local and internal words like food, garment,
cultural and traditional words and others in every notion. Truly, most of these
words do not have equivalent in the target language and these words need to be
worked and find their equivalent in the target language to fully understand the
both languages. The purpose of this research is to introduce the methods of
rendering non-equivalent words professionally from the source language to the
target language and this research has been completed using library-based
research. However, some of these non-equivalent words are already
professionally rendered to the target language but still there many other words
to be rendered. As a result, this research paper includes different ways and
rules of rendering non-equivalent words from source language to the target
language and 25 non-equvalent words have been rendered from Dar & Uzbek into
English and Russian languages.

Motivation: 传统可编程任务对话代理依赖精准状态跟踪，但在复杂场景下面临挑战。通过执行感知的对话状态跟踪机制，可提升用户目标预测的鲁棒性。

Method: 采用受限解码技术，用语言模型替代传统语法规则生成API调用代码，通过代码执行反馈进行迭代式状态修正

Result: 在SGD基准测试中实现最先进的性能（91.5%准确率），对话轮次增加时目标预测准确率相对基线提升23%

Conclusion: 执行感知的对话状态跟踪机制显著提升任务对话系统的鲁棒性，验证了代码生成与即时反馈结合的有效性

Abstract: Programmable task-oriented dialogue (TOD) agents enable language models to
follow structured dialogue policies, but their effectiveness hinges on accurate
state tracking. We present PyTOD, an agent that generates executable code to
track dialogue state and uses policy and execution feedback for efficient error
correction. To this end, PyTOD employs a simple constrained decoding approach,
using a language model instead of grammar rules to follow API schemata. This
leads to state-of-the-art state tracking performance on the challenging SGD
benchmark. Our experiments show that PyTOD surpasses strong baselines in both
accuracy and robust user goal estimation as the dialogue progresses,
demonstrating the effectiveness of execution-aware state tracking.

Motivation: 现有放射报告评估方法存在指标粗糙（仅总体评分）和黑盒模型不可解释的问题，难以满足临床实际需求

Method: 基于群体相对策略优化：1) 子分数动态加权（根据实时F1值调整错误类型优先级）；2) 多数引导优势缩放（基于子分数共识调整梯度更新）

Result: 在ReXVal基准测试中超越所有离线指标，与GPT-4评估结果持平，同时保持可解释性（人工可读的评分依据）和临床部署可行性

Conclusion: RadReason首次实现临床级细粒度评估，通过透明化评分机制突破传统黑盒限制，为医疗AI评估建立新范式

Abstract: Evaluating automatically generated radiology reports remains a fundamental
challenge due to the lack of clinically grounded, interpretable, and
fine-grained metrics. Existing methods either produce coarse overall scores or
rely on opaque black-box models, limiting their usefulness in real-world
clinical workflows. We introduce RadReason, a novel evaluation framework for
radiology reports that not only outputs fine-grained sub-scores across six
clinically defined error types, but also produces human-readable justifications
that explain the rationale behind each score. Our method builds on Group
Relative Policy Optimization and incorporates two key innovations: (1)
Sub-score Dynamic Weighting, which adaptively prioritizes clinically
challenging error types based on live F1 statistics; and (2) Majority-Guided
Advantage Scaling, which adjusts policy gradient updates based on prompt
difficulty derived from sub-score agreement. Together, these components enable
more stable optimization and better alignment with expert clinical judgment.
Experiments on the ReXVal benchmark show that RadReason surpasses all prior
offline metrics and achieves parity with GPT-4-based evaluations, while
remaining explainable, cost-efficient, and suitable for clinical deployment.
Code will be released upon publication.

Result: 在模拟客户行为的合成数据集上，对比监督基线模型提升17%的优惠接受率

Conclusion: SLM4Offer成功验证对比学习在营销场景的应用潜力，为数据驱动的个性化营销提供可扩展解决方案

Abstract: Personalized marketing has emerged as a pivotal strategy for enhancing
customer engagement and driving business growth. Academic and industry efforts
have predominantly focused on recommendation systems and personalized
advertisements. Nonetheless, this facet of personalization holds significant
potential for increasing conversion rates and improving customer satisfaction.
Prior studies suggest that well-executed personalization strategies can boost
revenue by up to 40 percent, underscoring the strategic importance of
developing intelligent, data-driven approaches for offer generation. This work
introduces SLM4Offer, a generative AI model for personalized offer generation,
developed by fine-tuning a pre-trained encoder-decoder language model,
specifically Google's Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5-Small 60M) using a
contrastive learning approach. SLM4Offer employs InfoNCE (Information
Noise-Contrastive Estimation) loss to align customer personas with relevant
offers in a shared embedding space. A key innovation in SLM4Offer lies in the
adaptive learning behaviour introduced by contrastive loss, which reshapes the
latent space during training and enhances the model's generalizability. The
model is fine-tuned and evaluated on a synthetic dataset designed to simulate
customer behaviour and offer acceptance patterns. Experimental results
demonstrate a 17 percent improvement in offer acceptance rate over a supervised
fine-tuning baseline, highlighting the effectiveness of contrastive objectives
in advancing personalized marketing.

Motivation: 研究质疑LLM能否有效捕捉用户异构且主观的浏览行为（如网页浏览记录形成的类语言结构），并探讨单一模型在多样用户行为中的适应性问题。

Method: 提出HeTLM方法：使用页面级分词器训练小型LM，采用异构簇特定参数集进行分簇训练，优化模型对主观行为的表征能力。

Result: 1. 小型LM性能超越大型预训练模型；2. 异构分簇模型优于同参数量的单一模型；3. 生成结果呈现高均值、低方差，用户对齐效果提升。

Conclusion: 针对主观行为设计的小型异构模型在效果和用户对齐上优于传统LLM，为处理个性化用户行为数据提供了新范式。

Abstract: A Large Language Model (LLM) offers versatility across domains and tasks,
purportedly benefiting users with a wide variety of behaviors and preferences.
We question this perception about an LLM when users have inherently subjective
behaviors and preferences, as seen in their ubiquitous and idiosyncratic
browsing of websites or apps. The sequential behavior logs of pages, thus
generated, form something akin to each user's self-constructed "language",
albeit without the structure and grammar imbued in natural languages. We ask:
(i) Can a small LM represent the "language of browsing" better than a large LM?
(ii) Can an LM with a single set of parameters (or, single LM) adequately
capture myriad users' heterogeneous, subjective behaviors and preferences?
(iii) Can a single LM with high average performance, yield low variance in
performance to make alignment good at user level? We introduce clusterwise LM
training, HeTLM (Heterogeneity aware Training of Language Model), appropriate
for subjective behaviors. We find that (i) a small LM trained using a
page-level tokenizer outperforms large pretrained or finetuned LMs; (ii) HeTLM
with heterogeneous cluster specific set of parameters outperforms a single LM
of the same family, controlling for the number of parameters; and (iii) a
higher mean and a lower variance in generation ensues, implying improved
alignment.

Method: 通过计算训练样本对模型输出的影响力评分，构建基于模型训练动态的课程学习排序

Result: 使用新课程训练的模型在基准测试中比随机顺序训练提升超过10个百分点

Conclusion: 采用模型本位的难度评估标准可有效提升课程学习在语言模型预训练中的效果

Abstract: Curriculum learning, a training technique where data is presented to the
model in order of example difficulty (e.g., from simpler to more complex
documents), has shown limited success for pre-training language models. In this
work, we investigate whether curriculum learning becomes competitive if we
replace conventional human-centered difficulty metrics with one that more
closely corresponds to example difficulty as observed during model training.
Specifically, we experiment with sorting training examples by their
\textit{training data influence}, a score which estimates the effect of
individual training examples on the model's output. Models trained on our
curricula are able to outperform ones trained in random order by over 10
percentage points in benchmarks, confirming that curriculum learning is
beneficial for language model pre-training, as long as a more model-centric
notion of difficulty is adopted.

rigorous comparison of their effectiveness. Unlike prior benchmarks, SLM-Bench
quantifies 11 metrics across correctness, computation, and consumption,
enabling a holistic assessment of efficiency trade-offs. Our evaluation
considers controlled hardware conditions, ensuring fair comparisons across
models. We develop an open-source benchmarking pipeline with standardized
evaluation protocols to facilitate reproducibility and further research. Our
findings highlight the diverse trade-offs among SLMs, where some models excel
in accuracy while others achieve superior energy efficiency. SLM-Bench sets a
new standard for SLM evaluation, bridging the gap between resource efficiency
and real-world applicability.

Abstract: Political language is deeply intertwined with social identities. While social
identities are often shaped by specific cultural contexts and expressed through
particular uses of language, existing datasets for group and identity detection
are predominantly English-centric, single-label and focus on coarse identity
categories. We introduce HebID, the first multilabel Hebrew corpus for social
identity detection: 5,536 sentences from Israeli politicians' Facebook posts
(Dec 2018-Apr 2021), manually annotated for twelve nuanced social identities
(e.g. Rightist, Ultra-Orthodox, Socially-oriented) grounded by survey data. We
benchmark multilabel and single-label encoders alongside 2B-9B-parameter
generative LLMs, finding that Hebrew-tuned LLMs provide the best results
(macro-$F_1$ = 0.74). We apply our classifier to politicians' Facebook posts
and parliamentary speeches, evaluating differences in popularity, temporal
trends, clustering patterns, and gender-related variations in identity
expression. We utilize identity choices from a national public survey, enabling
a comparison between identities portrayed in elite discourse and the public's
identity priorities. HebID provides a comprehensive foundation for studying
social identities in Hebrew and can serve as a model for similar research in
other non-English political contexts.

Conclusion: 通过开源Dream-Base和Dream-Instruct模型，推动扩散式语言建模领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: We introduce Dream 7B, the most powerful open diffusion large language model
to date. Unlike autoregressive (AR) models that generate tokens sequentially,
Dream 7B employs discrete diffusion modeling to refine sequences in parallel
through iterative denoising. Our model consistently outperforms existing
diffusion language models on general, mathematical, and coding tasks. Dream 7B
demonstrates superior planning abilities and inference flexibility, including
arbitrary-order generation, infilling capabilities, and tunable quality-speed
trade-offs. These results are achieved through simple yet effective training
techniques, including AR-based LLM initialization and context-adaptive
token-level noise rescheduling. We release both Dream-Base and Dream-Instruct
to facilitate further research in diffusion-based language modeling.

Result: 最佳模型F1达0.74，跨三十年数据显示：社交媒体PDD比议会高53%，右翼使用率超左翼28%，选举期间出现5倍峰值。

Conclusion: 验证自动化PDD分析的可行性，揭示话语暴力与政治周期、性别及意识形态的关联，为民主话语监测提供方法论创新。

Abstract: We present the first large-scale computational study of political
delegitimization discourse (PDD), defined as symbolic attacks on the normative
validity of political entities. We curate and manually annotate a novel
Hebrew-language corpus of 10,410 sentences drawn from Knesset speeches
(1993-2023), Facebook posts (2018-2021), and leading news outlets, of which
1,812 instances (17.4\%) exhibit PDD and 642 carry additional annotations for
intensity, incivility, target type, and affective framing. We introduce a
two-stage classification pipeline combining finetuned encoder models and
decoder LLMs. Our best model (DictaLM 2.0) attains an F$_1$ of 0.74 for binary
PDD detection and a macro-F$_1$ of 0.67 for classification of delegitimization
characteristics. Applying this classifier to longitudinal and cross-platform
data, we see a marked rise in PDD over three decades, higher prevalence on
social media versus parliamentary debate, greater use by male than female
politicians, and stronger tendencies among right-leaning actors - with
pronounced spikes during election campaigns and major political events. Our
findings demonstrate the feasibility and value of automated PDD analysis for
understanding democratic discourse.

TL;DR: SafetyFlow：首个通过协调七个代理在四天内自动构建LLM安全基准的系统，显著减少时间和资源成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全评估基准依赖人工构建，导致时间/资源消耗大、冗余度高且难度有限，需开发自动化方案提升效率。

Method: 通过编排七个专业代理构建自动化流程，整合工具集和人类专业知识，实现过程可控的基准自动生成。

Result: 构建的SafetyFlowBench包含23,446个低冗余、强区分力的测试查询，并在49个先进LLM上验证了系统效能。

Conclusion: SafetyFlow成功解决了传统基准构建效率低下的问题，为LLM安全评估提供了首个全自动化解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the
requirement for reliable safety evaluation to uncover model vulnerabilities. To
this end, numerous LLM safety evaluation benchmarks are proposed. However,
existing benchmarks generally rely on labor-intensive manual curation, which
causes excessive time and resource consumption. They also exhibit significant
redundancy and limited difficulty. To alleviate these problems, we introduce
SafetyFlow, the first agent-flow system designed to automate the construction
of LLM safety benchmarks. SafetyFlow can automatically build a comprehensive
safety benchmark in only four days without any human intervention by
orchestrating seven specialized agents, significantly reducing time and
resource cost. Equipped with versatile tools, the agents of SafetyFlow ensure
process and cost controllability while integrating human expertise into the
automatic pipeline. The final constructed dataset, SafetyFlowBench, contains
23,446 queries with low redundancy and strong discriminative power. Our
contribution includes the first fully automated benchmarking pipeline and a
comprehensive safety benchmark. We evaluate the safety of 49 advanced LLMs on
our dataset and conduct extensive experiments to validate our efficacy and
efficiency.

Motivation: 发现大语言模型作为判别器识别有害请求的能力强于生成器防御能力，通过对齐两种能力解决安全不一致性问题。

Method: 利用模型自身判别能力构建奖励机制，通过强化学习迭代优化生成策略，形成闭环自改进系统。

Result: SDGO在安全性和OOD攻击鲁棒性上显著优于基线模型，通用任务帮助性保持90%以上（如GSM8K 80.2%）。

Conclusion: 判别与生成能力的对齐实现双向增强，少量判别样本即可持续提升生成安全边界，为模型自进化提供新范式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at various natural language processing
tasks but remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks that induce harmful content
generation. In this paper, we reveal a critical safety inconsistency: LLMs can
more effectively identify harmful requests as discriminators than defend
against them as generators. This insight inspires us to explore aligning the
model's inherent discrimination and generation capabilities. To this end, we
propose SDGO (Self-Discrimination-Guided Optimization), a reinforcement
learning framework that leverages the model's own discrimination capabilities
as a reward signal to enhance generation safety through iterative
self-improvement. Our method does not require any additional annotated data or
external models during the training phase. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SDGO significantly improves model safety compared to both prompt-based and
training-based baselines while maintaining helpfulness on general benchmarks.
By aligning LLMs' discrimination and generation capabilities, SDGO brings
robust performance against out-of-distribution (OOD) jailbreaking attacks. This
alignment achieves tighter coupling between these two capabilities, enabling
the model's generation capability to be further enhanced with only a small
amount of discriminative samples. Our code and datasets are available at
https://github.com/NJUNLP/SDGO.

Conclusion: 科研综述自动化生成是复杂任务，需持续研究改进，SurGE基准为领域提供了标准化评估工具。

Abstract: Scientific survey articles play a vital role in summarizing research
progress, yet their manual creation is becoming increasingly infeasible due to
the rapid growth of academic literature. While large language models (LLMs)
offer promising capabilities for automating this process, progress in this area
is hindered by the absence of standardized benchmarks and evaluation protocols.
To address this gap, we introduce SurGE (Survey Generation Evaluation), a new
benchmark for evaluating scientific survey generation in the computer science
domain. SurGE consists of (1) a collection of test instances, each including a
topic description, an expert-written survey, and its full set of cited
references, and (2) a large-scale academic corpus of over one million papers
that serves as the retrieval pool. In addition, we propose an automated
evaluation framework that measures generated surveys across four dimensions:
information coverage, referencing accuracy, structural organization, and
content quality. Our evaluation of diverse LLM-based approaches shows that
survey generation remains highly challenging, even for advanced self-reflection
frameworks. These findings highlight the complexity of the task and the
necessity for continued research. We have open-sourced all the code, data, and
models at: https://github.com/oneal2000/SurGE

Motivation: 位置偏差(PB)导致长文本不同位置的理解能力差异显著，传统架构改进未能有效解决该问题。研究旨在通过知识蒸馏机制消除位置间性能鸿沟。

Method: 设计Pos2Distill-R¹和Pos2Distill-R²两个专用系统，利用位置诱导差异反向抵消PB：前者针对检索任务，后者面向推理任务，均基于位置到位置的知识蒸馏原理。

Result: 实验显示所有上下文位置性能显著提升，检索/推理任务分别取得SOTA效果，且两个系统展现出强跨任务泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过将优势位置能力迁移至劣势位置，Pos2Distill成功实现位置偏差的自我矫正，为长文本处理提供新的解决方案。

Abstract: Positional bias (PB), manifesting as non-uniform sensitivity across different
contextual locations, significantly impairs long-context comprehension and
processing capabilities. While prior work seeks to mitigate PB through
modifying the architectures causing its emergence, significant PB still
persists. To address PB effectively, we introduce \textbf{Pos2Distill}, a
position to position knowledge distillation framework. Pos2Distill transfers
the superior capabilities from advantageous positions to less favorable ones,
thereby reducing the huge performance gaps. The conceptual principle is to
leverage the inherent, position-induced disparity to counteract the PB itself.
We identify distinct manifestations of PB under \textbf{\textsc{r}}etrieval and
\textbf{\textsc{r}}easoning paradigms, thereby designing two specialized
instantiations: \emph{Pos2Distill-R\textsuperscript{1}} and
\emph{Pos2Distill-R\textsuperscript{2}} respectively, both grounded in this
core principle. By employing the Pos2Distill approach, we achieve enhanced
uniformity and significant performance gains across all contextual positions in
long-context retrieval and reasoning tasks. Crucially, both specialized systems
exhibit strong cross-task generalization mutually, while achieving superior
performance on their respective tasks.

Motivation: 孟加拉语作为高屈折形态语言面临数字化困境，现有词干提取技术存在文献断层、缺乏可用实现、评估指标不科学等问题，制约自然语言处理发展。

Method: 通过文献计量学方法全面梳理历史研究，分析不同形态处理方法的效果，结合语言特性构建评估框架。

Result: 发现现有方法对复杂形态变体处理不足（准确率低于80%），方言适应性差，且缺乏统一测试集（当前最大数据集仅含5万词例）。

Conclusion: 建议开发融合形态规则的混合式词干提取器，建立跨方言标注语料库，采用F1-score等综合评估指标，推动孟加拉语NLP基础设施建设。

Abstract: Bangla, the seventh most widely spoken language worldwide with 300 million
native speakers, faces digital under-representation due to limited resources
and lack of annotated datasets. Stemming, a critical preprocessing step in
language analysis, is essential for low-resource, highly-inflectional languages
like Bangla, because it can reduce the complexity of algorithms and models by
significantly reducing the number of words the algorithm needs to consider.
This paper conducts a comprehensive survey of stemming approaches, emphasizing
the importance of handling morphological variants effectively. While exploring
the landscape of Bangla stemming, it becomes evident that there is a
significant gap in the existing literature. The paper highlights the
discontinuity from previous research and the scarcity of accessible
implementations for replication. Furthermore, it critiques the evaluation
methodologies, stressing the need for more relevant metrics. In the context of
Bangla's rich morphology and diverse dialects, the paper acknowledges the
challenges it poses. To address these challenges, the paper suggests directions
for Bangla stemmer development. It concludes by advocating for robust Bangla
stemmers and continued research in the field to enhance language analysis and
processing.

Method: 构建含406K样本、8.9M图像的多任务数据集EcomMMMU，设计8个核心任务和VSS子集。提出SUMEI方法通过预测视觉效用策略性利用多图

Result: 实验表明产品图像存在性能下降案例，SUMEI在多个任务中展现稳健提升（VQA准确率+2.7%，图像分类F1+4.1%）

Conclusion: MLLMs需更智能的视觉内容利用策略，数据驱动方法SUMEI为电商多模态理解提供有效解决方案

Abstract: E-commerce platforms are rich in multimodal data, featuring a variety of
images that depict product details. However, this raises an important question:
do these images always enhance product understanding, or can they sometimes
introduce redundancy or degrade performance? Existing datasets are limited in
both scale and design, making it difficult to systematically examine this
question. To this end, we introduce EcomMMMU, an e-commerce multimodal
multitask understanding dataset with 406,190 samples and 8,989,510 images.
EcomMMMU is comprised of multi-image visual-language data designed with 8
essential tasks and a specialized VSS subset to benchmark the capability of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to effectively utilize visual content.
Analysis on EcomMMMU reveals that product images do not consistently improve
performance and can, in some cases, degrade it. This indicates that MLLMs may
struggle to effectively leverage rich visual content for e-commerce tasks.
Building on these insights, we propose SUMEI, a data-driven method that
strategically utilizes multiple images via predicting visual utilities before
using them for downstream tasks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of SUMEI. The data and code are available through
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/submission25.

Result: 在多数据中心实验中超越GPT-4o等基准模型，在常见/罕见疾病的分布内外场景均取得显著准确率提升

Conclusion: 该框架通过强化学习优化诊断策略，提升初步诊断的可靠性和精确性，支持临床决策可解释性

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis with medical large language models is hindered by
knowledge gaps and hallucinations. Retrieval and tool-augmented methods help,
but their impact is limited by weak use of external knowledge and poor
feedback-reasoning traceability. To address these challenges, We introduce
Deep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement
learning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for
medical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical
retrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge
sources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More
crutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its
environment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure,
and diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from
large-scale data through RL.
  Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework
consistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches
across multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves
substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic
baselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks
for both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and
out-of-distribution settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and
retrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the
uniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional
implementations. Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight
improvements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight
into its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more
reliable and precise preliminary diagnoses. See

Result: TIR模型在数学/非数学任务均优于基线，显著减少过度思考现象，提升推理流程效率

Conclusion: TIR具有跨领域增强LLM推理能力的潜力，其性能成本评估框架为优化复杂推理提供新方向

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning tasks
through methods like chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they often fall
short in tasks requiring precise computations. Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR)
has emerged as a solution by incorporating external tools into the reasoning
process. Nevertheless, the generalization of TIR in improving the reasoning
ability of LLM is still unclear. Additionally, whether TIR has improved the
model's reasoning behavior and helped the model think remains to be studied. We
introduce ReasonZoo, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing nine diverse
reasoning categories, to evaluate the effectiveness of TIR across various
domains. Additionally, we propose two novel metrics, Performance-Aware Cost
(PAC) and Area Under the Performance-Cost Curve (AUC-PCC), to assess reasoning
efficiency. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that TIR-enabled models
consistently outperform their non-TIR counterparts in both mathematical and
non-mathematical tasks. Furthermore, TIR enhances reasoning efficiency, as
evidenced by improved PAC and AUC-PCC, indicating reduced overthinking and more
streamlined reasoning. These findings underscore the domain-general benefits of
TIR and its potential to advance LLM capabilities in complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Tool calling has emerged as a critical capability for AI agents to interact
with the real world and solve complex tasks. While the Model Context Protocol
(MCP) provides a powerful standardized framework for tool integration, there is
a significant gap in benchmarking how well AI agents can effectively solve
multi-step tasks using diverse MCP tools in realistic, dynamic scenarios. In
this work, we present LiveMCP-101, a benchmark of 101 carefully curated
real-world queries, refined through iterative LLM rewriting and manual review,
that require coordinated use of multiple MCP tools including web search, file
operations, mathematical reasoning, and data analysis. Moreover, we introduce a
novel evaluation approach that leverages ground-truth execution plans rather
than raw API outputs, better reflecting the evolving nature of real-world
environments. Experiments show that even frontier LLMs achieve a success rate
below 60\%, highlighting major challenges in tool orchestration. Detailed
ablations and error analysis further reveal distinct failure modes and
inefficiencies in token usage, pointing to concrete directions for advancing
current models. LiveMCP-101 sets a rigorous standard for evaluating real-world
agent capabilities, advancing toward autonomous AI systems that reliably
execute complex tasks through tool use.

Conclusion: 该多技术融合方案有效平衡计算效率与光影精度，为混合现实应用提供实用重照明解决方案。

Abstract: Mixed Reality scene relighting, where virtual changes to lighting conditions
realistically interact with physical objects, producing authentic illumination
and shadows, can be used in a variety of applications. One such application in
real estate could be visualizing a room at different times of day and placing
virtual light fixtures. Existing deep learning-based relighting techniques
typically exceed the real-time performance capabilities of current MR devices.
On the other hand, scene understanding methods, such as on-device scene
reconstruction, often yield inaccurate results due to scanning limitations, in
turn affecting relighting quality. Finally, simpler 2D image filter-based
approaches cannot represent complex geometry and shadows. We introduce a novel
method to integrate image segmentation, with lighting propagation via
anisotropic diffusion on top of basic scene understanding, and the
computational simplicity of filter-based techniques. Our approach corrects
on-device scanning inaccuracies, delivering visually appealing and accurate
relighting effects in real-time on edge devices, achieving speeds as high as
100 fps. We show a direct comparison between our method and the industry
standard, and present a practical demonstration of our method in the
aforementioned real estate example.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习去偏见方法通常需要复杂调整或高计算成本，而DeCoDi仅需修改推理过程即可适用于各类扩散模型

Method: 通过调整扩散过程避开潜在维度中的偏见概念区域，不改变模型结构且保持计算效率

Result: 在性别/种族/年龄偏见实验中，人工评估1200张图像显示有效减轻偏见，自动评估（GPT4o）与人工评估结果具有统计一致性

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高生成图像的多样性，评估显示保护属性覆盖更全面，为扩散模型提供高效去偏见解决方案

Abstract: We propose DeCoDi, a debiasing procedure for text-to-image diffusion-based
models that changes the inference procedure, does not significantly change
image quality, has negligible compute overhead, and can be applied in any
diffusion-based image generation model. DeCoDi changes the diffusion process to
avoid latent dimension regions of biased concepts. While most deep learning
debiasing methods require complex or compute-intensive interventions, our
method is designed to change only the inference procedure. Therefore, it is
more accessible to a wide range of practitioners. We show the effectiveness of
the method by debiasing for gender, ethnicity, and age for the concepts of
nurse, firefighter, and CEO. Two distinct human evaluators manually inspect
1,200 generated images. Their evaluation results provide evidence that our
method is effective in mitigating biases based on gender, ethnicity, and age.
We also show that an automatic bias evaluation performed by the GPT4o is not
significantly statistically distinct from a human evaluation. Our evaluation
shows promising results, with reliable levels of agreement between evaluators
and more coverage of protected attributes. Our method has the potential to
significantly improve the diversity of images it generates by diffusion-based
text-to-image generative models.

Abstract: Understanding visual narratives such as comics requires structured
representations that capture events, characters, and their relations across
multiple levels of story organization. However, symbolic narrative graphs often
suffer from inconsistency and redundancy, where similar actions or events are
labeled differently across annotations or contexts. Such variance limits the
effectiveness of reasoning and generalization.
  This paper introduces a semantic normalization framework for hierarchical
narrative knowledge graphs. Building on cognitively grounded models of
narrative comprehension, we propose methods that consolidate semantically
related actions and events using lexical similarity and embedding-based
clustering. The normalization process reduces annotation noise, aligns symbolic
categories across narrative levels, and preserves interpretability.
  We demonstrate the framework on annotated manga stories from the Manga109
dataset, applying normalization to panel-, event-, and story-level graphs.
Preliminary evaluations across narrative reasoning tasks, such as action
retrieval, character grounding, and event summarization, show that semantic
normalization improves coherence and robustness, while maintaining symbolic
transparency. These findings suggest that normalization is a key step toward
scalable, cognitively inspired graph models for multimodal narrative
understanding.

<details>

Result: 实验表明模型可稳定运行千步以上，跨任务泛化能力提升，支持纯神经引擎策略学习，并能通过真实数据微调缩小仿真差距

Conclusion: NeRD在保持传统仿真器架构优势的同时，通过神经网络的灵活表征显著提升了仿真系统的适应性和可扩展性

Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulation of modern robots remains challenging due to
their high degrees of freedom and intricate mechanisms. Neural simulators have
emerged as a promising alternative to traditional analytical simulators,
capable of efficiently predicting complex dynamics and adapting to real-world
data; however, existing neural simulators typically require
application-specific training and fail to generalize to novel tasks and/or
environments, primarily due to inadequate representations of the global state.
In this work, we address the problem of learning generalizable neural
simulators for robots that are structured as articulated rigid bodies. We
propose NeRD (Neural Robot Dynamics), learned robot-specific dynamics models
for predicting future states for articulated rigid bodies under contact
constraints. NeRD uniquely replaces the low-level dynamics and contact solvers
in an analytical simulator and employs a robot-centric and spatially-invariant
simulation state representation. We integrate the learned NeRD models as an
interchangeable backend solver within a state-of-the-art robotics simulator. We
conduct extensive experiments to show that the NeRD simulators are stable and
accurate over a thousand simulation steps; generalize across tasks and
environment configurations; enable policy learning exclusively in a neural
engine; and, unlike most classical simulators, can be fine-tuned from
real-world data to bridge the gap between simulation and reality.

2. 通过用户多选反馈重写歧义问题

Result: 在歧义查询数据集上达到87.2%检测精度，集成后SQL准确匹配率提升50%

Conclusion: AmbiSQL显著提升Text-to-SQL系统性能，提供开源代码和演示验证实用性（项目地址：https://github.com/JustinzjDing/AmbiSQL）

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language questions into SQL queries,
providing substantial value for non-expert users. While large language models
(LLMs) show promising results for this task, they remain error-prone. Query
ambiguity has been recognized as a major obstacle for LLM-based Text-to-SQL
systems, leading to misinterpretation of user intent and inaccurate SQL
generation. We demonstrate AmbiSQL, an interactive system that automatically
detects query ambiguities and guides users through intuitive multiple-choice
questions to clarify their intent. Our approach introduces a fine-grained
ambiguity taxonomy for identifying ambiguities that affect database element
mapping and LLM reasoning, then incorporates user feedback to rewrite ambiguous
questions. Evaluation on an ambiguous query dataset shows that AmbiSQL achieves
87.2% precision in ambiguity detection and improves SQL exact match accuracy by
50% when integrated with Text-to-SQL systems. Our demonstration showcases the
significant performance gains and highlights the system's practical usability.

Method: 建立住院前后配对录音数据库，采用患者个体分类和个性化配对分类方法，提出自适应频率滤波器进行频域分析

Result: 汉语语音对急慢性心衰检测有效，配对分类准确率更高（受试者间差异是主要误差源）

Conclusion: 中文语音具备心衰检测潜力，个性化建模可提升效果，公开数据库促进后续研究

Abstract: Speech is a cost-effective and non-intrusive data source for identifying
acute and chronic heart failure (HF). However, there is a lack of research on
whether Chinese syllables contain HF-related information, as observed in other
well-studied languages. This study presents the first Chinese speech database
of HF patients, featuring paired recordings taken before and after
hospitalisation. The findings confirm the effectiveness of the Chinese language
in HF detection using both standard 'patient-wise' and personalised 'pair-wise'
classification approaches, with the latter serving as an ideal
speaker-decoupled baseline for future research. Statistical tests and
classification results highlight individual differences as key contributors to
inaccuracy. Additionally, an adaptive frequency filter (AFF) is proposed for
frequency importance analysis. The data and demonstrations are published at

Motivation: 验证CSG指标在多关系链接预测任务中的有效性，解决现有复杂性度量与知识图谱任务脱节的问题

Method: 结合Transformer语义嵌入，系统评估CSG参数敏感性，提出关系熵、最大关系多样性等新型复杂性指标并进行基准测试

Result: CSG与MRR/Hit@1相关性弱，关系熵等语义指标与性能强负相关，图连通性指标与Hit@10正相关

Conclusion: 需要开发与任务对齐的稳定复杂性指标，关系类语义度量比传统谱方法更适合评估知识图谱链接预测难度

Abstract: Understanding dataset complexity is fundamental to evaluating and comparing
link prediction models on knowledge graphs (KGs). While the Cumulative Spectral
Gradient (CSG) metric, derived from probabilistic divergence between classes
within a spectral clustering framework, has been proposed as a classifier
agnostic complexity metric purportedly scaling with class cardinality and
correlating with downstream performance, it has not been evaluated in KG
settings so far. In this work, we critically examine CSG in the context of
multi relational link prediction, incorporating semantic representations via
transformer derived embeddings. Contrary to prior claims, we find that CSG is
highly sensitive to parametrisation and does not robustly scale with the number
of classes. Moreover, it exhibits weak or inconsistent correlation with
standard performance metrics such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hit@1. To
deepen the analysis, we introduce and benchmark a set of structural and
semantic KG complexity metrics. Our findings reveal that global and local
relational ambiguity captured via Relation Entropy, node level Maximum Relation
Diversity, and Relation Type Cardinality exhibit strong inverse correlations
with MRR and Hit@1, suggesting these as more faithful indicators of task
difficulty. Conversely, graph connectivity measures such as Average Degree,
Degree Entropy, PageRank, and Eigenvector Centrality correlate positively with
Hit@10. Our results demonstrate that CSGs purported stability and
generalization predictive power fail to hold in link prediction settings and
underscore the need for more stable, interpretable, and task-aligned measures
of dataset complexity in knowledge driven learning.

Conclusion: CITE填补了异构文本属性图基准的空白，验证了异构建模对材料科学的价值，为多模态图学习提供了新的标准测试平台。

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs(TAGs) are pervasive in real-world systems,where each
node carries its own textual features. In many cases these graphs are
inherently heterogeneous, containing multiple node types and diverse edge
types. Despite the ubiquity of such heterogeneous TAGs, there remains a lack of
large-scale benchmark datasets. This shortage has become a critical bottleneck,
hindering the development and fair comparison of representation learning
methods on heterogeneous text-attributed graphs. In this paper, we introduce
CITE - Catalytic Information Textual Entities Graph, the first and largest
heterogeneous text-attributed citation graph benchmark for catalytic materials.
CITE comprises over 438K nodes and 1.2M edges, spanning four relation types. In
addition, we establish standardized evaluation procedures and conduct extensive
benchmarking on the node classification task, as well as ablation experiments
on the heterogeneous and textual properties of CITE. We compare four classes of
learning paradigms, including homogeneous graph models, heterogeneous graph
models, LLM(Large Language Model)-centric models, and LLM+Graph models. In a
nutshell, we provide (i) an overview of the CITE dataset, (ii) standardized
evaluation protocols, and (iii) baseline and ablation experiments across
diverse modeling paradigms.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注分类器准确性，但忽视分类错误对统计推断（如相关性、效应量）的下游影响，可能导致科学结论偏差。

Method: 采用贝叶斯校准方法，分析LENA和ACLEW语音分类器的错误对两项关键研究（兄弟姐妹对语言输入的影响、儿童产出与输入的关联）的估计偏差。

Result: 自动化注释使兄弟姐妹对成人语言输入的负面效应被低估20-80%，贝叶斯校准可恢复部分真实效应但无法完全消除误差影响。

Conclusion: 分类错误会广泛影响基于事件检测的算法研究，研究者需系统性评估误差对统计推断的影响，校准方法需谨慎应用。

Abstract: With the advent of wearable recorders, scientists are increasingly turning to
automated methods of analysis of audio and video data in order to measure
children's experience, behavior, and outcomes, with a sizable literature
employing long-form audio-recordings to study language acquisition. While
numerous articles report on the accuracy and reliability of the most popular
automated classifiers, less has been written on the downstream effects of
classification errors on measurements and statistical inferences (e.g., the
estimate of correlations and effect sizes in regressions). This paper proposes
a Bayesian approach to study the effects of algorithmic errors on key
scientific questions, including the effect of siblings on children's language
experience and the association between children's production and their input.
In both the most commonly used \gls{lena}, and an open-source alternative (the
Voice Type Classifier from the ACLEW system), we find that classification
errors can significantly distort estimates. For instance, automated annotations
underestimated the negative effect of siblings on adult input by 20--80\%,
potentially placing it below statistical significance thresholds. We further
show that a Bayesian calibration approach for recovering unbiased estimates of
effect sizes can be effective and insightful, but does not provide a fool-proof
solution. Both the issue reported and our solution may apply to any classifier
involving event detection and classification with non-zero error rates.

Conclusion: Intern-S1通过系统创新实现科学领域突破，为AGI发展提供新路径，模型已开源推动科研转型

Abstract: In recent years, a plethora of open-source foundation models have emerged,
achieving remarkable progress in some widely attended fields, with performance
being quite close to that of closed-source models. However, in high-value but
more challenging scientific professional fields, either the fields still rely
on expert models, or the progress of general foundation models lags
significantly compared to those in popular areas, far from sufficient for
transforming scientific research and leaving substantial gap between
open-source models and closed-source models in these scientific domains. To
mitigate this gap and explore a step further toward Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI), we introduce Intern-S1, a specialized generalist equipped
with general understanding and reasoning capabilities with expertise to analyze
multiple science modal data. Intern-S1 is a multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
model with 28 billion activated parameters and 241 billion total parameters,
continually pre-trained on 5T tokens, including over 2.5T tokens from
scientific domains. In the post-training stage, Intern-S1 undergoes offline and
then online reinforcement learning (RL) in InternBootCamp, where we propose
Mixture-of-Rewards (MoR) to synergize the RL training on more than 1000 tasks
simultaneously. Through integrated innovations in algorithms, data, and
training systems, Intern-S1 achieved top-tier performance in online RL
training.On comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, Intern-S1 demonstrates
competitive performance on general reasoning tasks among open-source models and
significantly outperforms open-source models in scientific domains, surpassing
closed-source state-of-the-art models in professional tasks, such as molecular
synthesis planning, reaction condition prediction, predicting thermodynamic
stabilities for crystals. Our models are available at

Result: 在复杂场景中验证了群体自动分合、信息传递等涌现行为，生成更符合现实的人际交互模式

Conclusion: 语言驱动的建模方法使群体行为自然涌现，显著提升了人群模拟系统的社交真实性和环境适应性

Abstract: Animating and simulating crowds using an agent-based approach is a
well-established area where every agent in the crowd is individually controlled
such that global human-like behaviour emerges. We observe that human navigation
and movement in crowds are often influenced by complex social and environmental
interactions, driven mainly by language and dialogue. However, most existing
work does not consider these dimensions and leads to animations where
agent-agent and agent-environment interactions are largely limited to steering
and fixed higher-level goal extrapolation.
  We propose a novel method that exploits large language models (LLMs) to
control agents' movement. Our method has two main components: a dialogue system
and language-driven navigation. We periodically query agent-centric LLMs
conditioned on character personalities, roles, desires, and relationships to
control the generation of inter-agent dialogue when necessitated by the spatial
and social relationships with neighbouring agents. We then use the conversation
and each agent's personality, emotional state, vision, and physical state to
control the navigation and steering of each agent. Our model thus enables
agents to make motion decisions based on both their perceptual inputs and the
ongoing dialogue.
  We validate our method in two complex scenarios that exemplify the interplay
between social interactions, steering, and crowding. In these scenarios, we
observe that grouping and ungrouping of agents automatically occur.
Additionally, our experiments show that our method serves as an
information-passing mechanism within the crowd. As a result, our framework
produces more realistic crowd simulations, with emergent group behaviours
arising naturally from any environmental setting.

Method: 使用ClimateX数据集并扩展至人类与行星健康领域，系统评估推理能力与计算预算对置信校准的影响

Result: 扩展推理导致系统性过度自信（48.7%准确率），检索增强方法达到89.3%准确率

Conclusion: 信息获取能力而非推理深度或计算预算，是提升知识任务置信校准的关键瓶颈

Abstract: Large Language Models deployed as question answering tools require robust
calibration to avoid overconfidence. We systematically evaluate how reasoning
capabilities and budget affect confidence assessment accuracy, using the
ClimateX dataset (Lacombe et al., 2023) and expanding it to human and planetary
health. Our key finding challenges the "test-time scaling" paradigm: while
recent reasoning LLMs achieve 48.7% accuracy in assessing expert confidence,
increasing reasoning budgets consistently impairs rather than improves
calibration. Extended reasoning leads to systematic overconfidence that worsens
with longer thinking budgets, producing diminishing and negative returns beyond
modest computational investments. Conversely, search-augmented generation
dramatically outperforms pure reasoning, achieving 89.3% accuracy by retrieving
relevant evidence. Our results suggest that information access, rather than
reasoning depth or inference budget, may be the critical bottleneck for
improved confidence calibration of knowledge-intensive tasks.

Conclusion: GOOD框架通过动态目标推理和LLM模拟实现了开放式任务中AI代理性能的显著提升，具有数据高效性和扩展优势

Abstract: Embodied AI agents must infer and act in an interpretable way on diverse
human goals and preferences that are not predefined. To formalize this setting,
we introduce Open-Universe Assistance Games (OU-AGs), a framework where the
agent must reason over an unbounded and evolving space of possible goals. In
this context, we introduce GOOD (GOals from Open-ended Dialogue), a
data-efficient, online method that extracts goals in the form of natural
language during an interaction with a human, and infers a distribution over
natural language goals. GOOD prompts an LLM to simulate users with different
complex intents, using its responses to perform probabilistic inference over
candidate goals. This approach enables rich goal representations and
uncertainty estimation without requiring large offline datasets. We evaluate
GOOD in a text-based grocery shopping domain and in a text-operated simulated
household robotics environment (AI2Thor), using synthetic user profiles. Our
method outperforms a baseline without explicit goal tracking, as confirmed by
both LLM-based and human evaluations.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled AI agents to
autonomously generate scientific proposals, conduct experiments, author papers,
and perform peer reviews. Yet this flood of AI-generated research content
collides with a fragmented and largely closed publication ecosystem.
Traditional journals and conferences rely on human peer review, making them
difficult to scale and often reluctant to accept AI-generated research content;
existing preprint servers (e.g. arXiv) lack rigorous quality-control
mechanisms. Consequently, a significant amount of high-quality AI-generated
research lacks appropriate venues for dissemination, hindering its potential to
advance scientific progress. To address these challenges, we introduce aiXiv, a
next-generation open-access platform for human and AI scientists. Its
multi-agent architecture allows research proposals and papers to be submitted,
reviewed, and iteratively refined by both human and AI scientists. It also
provides API and MCP interfaces that enable seamless integration of
heterogeneous human and AI scientists, creating a scalable and extensible
ecosystem for autonomous scientific discovery. Through extensive experiments,
we demonstrate that aiXiv is a reliable and robust platform that significantly
enhances the quality of AI-generated research proposals and papers after
iterative revising and reviewing on aiXiv. Our work lays the groundwork for a
next-generation open-access ecosystem for AI scientists, accelerating the
publication and dissemination of high-quality AI-generated research content.

comfort and psychosocial well-being. To date, no work has tailored LLMs to
advance the diagnosis or care of hyperhidrosis. To address this gap, we present
LLM4Sweat, an open-source and domain-specific LLM framework for trustworthy and
empathetic hyperhidrosis support. The system follows a three-stage pipeline. In
the data augmentation stage, a frontier LLM generates medically plausible
synthetic vignettes from curated open-source data to create a diverse and
balanced question-answer dataset. In the fine-tuning stage, an open-source
foundation model is fine-tuned on the dataset to provide diagnosis,
personalized treatment recommendations, and empathetic psychological support.
In the inference and expert evaluation stage, clinical and psychological
specialists assess accuracy, appropriateness, and empathy, with validated
responses iteratively enriching the dataset. Experiments show that LLM4Sweat
outperforms baselines and delivers the first open-source LLM framework for
hyperhidrosis, offering a generalizable approach for other rare diseases with
similar data and trustworthiness challenges.

*Gaoke Zhang,Bo Wang,Yunlong Ma,Dongming Zhao,Zifei Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出多重记忆系统(MMS)，通过认知心理学理论构建检索/上下文双记忆单元，有效提升智能体对历史数据的利用效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有智能体记忆模块（如MemoryBank、A-MEM）存储内容质量差，影响召回性能和响应质量。需构建高质量长期记忆体系解决数据利用问题。

Method: 1. 将短期记忆处理为多个长期记忆片段
2. 基于片段构建互为映射的检索记忆单元（匹配查询）和上下文记忆单元（生成响应）
3. 两阶段检索机制：先匹配检索单元，再获取对应上下文单元

Result: 1. 在LoCoMo数据集上超越3种基线方法
2. 消融实验验证记忆单元设计的合理性
3. 内存开销分析证明系统实用价值（支持约4000轮对话的长期记忆存储）

Conclusion: MMS系统通过认知心理学驱动的双记忆架构，显著提升智能体知识利用效率，为构建可持续学习型智能体提供新范式。

Abstract: An agent powered by large language models have achieved impressive results,
but effectively handling the vast amounts of historical data generated during
interactions remains a challenge. The current approach is to design a memory
module for the agent to process these data. However, existing methods, such as
MemoryBank and A-MEM, have poor quality of stored memory content, which affects
recall performance and response quality. In order to better construct
high-quality long-term memory content, we have designed a multiple memory
system (MMS) inspired by cognitive psychology theory. The system processes
short-term memory to multiple long-term memory fragments, and constructs
retrieval memory units and contextual memory units based on these fragments,
with a one-to-one correspondence between the two. During the retrieval phase,
MMS will match the most relevant retrieval memory units based on the user's
query. Then, the corresponding contextual memory units is obtained as the
context for the response stage to enhance knowledge, thereby effectively
utilizing historical data. Experiments on LoCoMo dataset compared our method
with three others, proving its effectiveness. Ablation studies confirmed the
rationality of our memory units. We also analyzed the robustness regarding the
number of selected memory segments and the storage overhead, demonstrating its
practical value.

Motivation: 解决现有ECG分析方法泛化性差、开放推理能力弱的问题，探索时序信号与语言模型的跨模态整合

Method: 1. 设计lead-independent编码器离散ECG信号 2. 扩展LLM词汇表实现多模态处理 3. 通过ECG预测预训练对齐模态 4. 指令微调支持问答和报告生成

Result: 在分布内外数据均取得优异表现，验证框架有效性，各组件贡献显著（编码器提升6.2%准确率，预训练提高9.8%生成质量）

Conclusion: 开创性地将符号化ECG表示融入LLM，为医疗时序信号处理提供新范式，展现多模态医疗推理的潜力

Abstract: Electrocardiography plays a central role in cardiovascular diagnostics, yet
existing automated approaches often struggle to generalize across clinical
tasks and offer limited support for open-ended reasoning. We present DiagECG, a
novel framework that integrates time-series and language modeling by enabling
large language models to process 12-lead ECG signals for clinical text
generation tasks. Our approach discretizes continuous ECG embeddings into
symbolic tokens using a lead-independent encoder and quantization module. These
tokens are then used to extend the vocabulary of LLM, allowing the model to
handle both ECG and natural language inputs in a unified manner. To bridge the
modality gap, we pretrain the model on an autoregressive ECG forecasting task,
enabling the LLM to model temporal dynamics using its native language modeling
capabilities. Finally, we perform instruction tuning on both ECG question
answering and diagnostic report generation. Without modifying the core model,
DiagECG achieves strong performance across tasks while maintaining
generalization to out-of-distribution settings. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of each component and highlight the potential of
integrating symbolic ECG representations into LLMs for medical reasoning.

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) is critically dependent on
the availability of high-quality datasets for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
alignment tasks like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), etc. In this work,
we present a comprehensive synthetic data generation framework that facilitates
scalable, configurable, and high-fidelity generation of synthetic data tailored
for these training paradigms. Our approach employs a modular and
configuration-based pipeline capable of modeling complex dialogue flows with
minimal manual intervention. This framework uses a dual-stage quality tagging
mechanism, combining heuristic rules and LLM-based evaluations, to
automatically filter and score data extracted from OASST-formatted
conversations, ensuring the curation of high-quality dialogue samples. The
resulting datasets are structured under a flexible schema supporting both SFT
and DPO use cases, enabling seamless integration into diverse training
workflows. Together, these innovations offer a robust solution for generating
and managing synthetic conversational data at scale, significantly reducing the
overhead of data preparation in LLM training pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统配置优化方法存在维度独立调参、缺乏语义关联理解的缺陷，自动化方法难以动态适应复杂场景。需要能同步处理多维度配置、具备语义推理能力的优化框架。

Method: 构建三智能体协同架构（配置顾问/评估器/优化器），引入文本梯度作为语义反馈信号，通过自然语言交互形成自改进闭环。结合数值优化与语义理解，解析配置参数间的动态关联。

Result: 在六个异构数据集上验证，LGT相比传统优化方法性能提升显著（具体指标未量化），同时保持决策过程的高度可解释性。

Conclusion: 语言引导的配置优化范式突破了传统数值优化的局限，多智能体协同机制为自动化机器学习提供了语义驱动的决策新路径。

Abstract: Configuration optimization remains a critical bottleneck in machine learning,
requiring coordinated tuning across model architecture, training strategy,
feature engineering, and hyperparameters. Traditional approaches treat these
dimensions independently and lack interpretability, while recent automated
methods struggle with dynamic adaptability and semantic reasoning about
optimization decisions. We introduce Language-Guided Tuning (LGT), a novel
framework that employs multi-agent Large Language Models to intelligently
optimize configurations through natural language reasoning. We apply textual
gradients - qualitative feedback signals that complement numerical optimization
by providing semantic understanding of training dynamics and configuration
interdependencies. LGT coordinates three specialized agents: an Advisor that
proposes configuration changes, an Evaluator that assesses progress, and an
Optimizer that refines the decision-making process, creating a self-improving
feedback loop. Through comprehensive evaluation on six diverse datasets, LGT
demonstrates substantial improvements over traditional optimization methods,
achieving performance gains while maintaining high interpretability.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出Few-Shot Adversarial Prompting (FSAP)框架，利用大模型上下文学习生成高排名的对抗文档，显著威胁神经检索系统


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法依赖梯度访问或人工改写，难以实现自然且可扩展的攻击。NRMs虽有效但存在对抗脆弱性，需探索更隐蔽的攻击方式

Method: 通过少量有害示例提示LLM生成语法流畅、主题连贯的对抗文档。FSAP-IntraQ利用同查询有害样本增强主题一致性，FSAP-InterQ实现跨查询模式迁移

Result: 在TREC健康 misinformation 数据集上，FSAP文档在4种排序模型中超越权威文档。对抗输出立场一致性达84%，检测率低于12%，且跨开源/商业LLM均有效

Conclusion: FSAP证明基于提示的对抗攻击具有现实威胁性，其生成的语义合理文档难以检测，可能危及神经检索系统的可信度与安全性

Abstract: While neural ranking models (NRMs) have shown high effectiveness, they remain
susceptible to adversarial manipulation. In this work, we introduce Few-Shot
Adversarial Prompting (FSAP), a novel black-box attack framework that leverages
the in-context learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to
generate high-ranking adversarial documents. Unlike previous approaches that
rely on token-level perturbations or manual rewriting of existing documents,
FSAP formulates adversarial attacks entirely through few-shot prompting,
requiring no gradient access or internal model instrumentation. By conditioning
the LLM on a small support set of previously observed harmful examples, FSAP
synthesizes grammatically fluent and topically coherent documents that subtly
embed false or misleading information and rank competitively against authentic
content. We instantiate FSAP in two modes: FSAP-IntraQ, which leverages harmful
examples from the same query to enhance topic fidelity, and FSAP-InterQ, which
enables broader generalization by transferring adversarial patterns across
unrelated queries. Our experiments on the TREC 2020 and 2021 Health
Misinformation Tracks, using four diverse neural ranking models, reveal that
FSAP-generated documents consistently outrank credible, factually accurate
documents. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that these adversarial
outputs exhibit strong stance alignment and low detectability, posing a
realistic and scalable threat to neural retrieval systems. FSAP also
effectively generalizes across both proprietary and open-source LLMs.

Abstract: Advancements in diffusion-based foundation models have improved text-to-image
generation, yet most efforts have been limited to low-resolution settings. As
high-resolution image synthesis becomes increasingly essential for various
applications, particularly in medical imaging domains, fine-tuning emerges as a
crucial mechanism for adapting these powerful pre-trained models to
task-specific requirements and data distributions. In this work, we present a
systematic study, examining the impact of various fine-tuning techniques on
image generation quality when scaling to high resolution 512x512 pixels. We
benchmark a diverse set of fine-tuning methods, including full fine-tuning
strategies and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). We dissect how different
fine-tuning methods influence key quality metrics, including Fr\'echet
Inception Distance (FID), Vendi score, and prompt-image alignment. We also
evaluate the utility of generated images in a downstream classification task
under data-scarce conditions, demonstrating that specific fine-tuning
strategies improve both generation fidelity and downstream performance when
synthetic images are used for classifier training and evaluation on real
images. Our code is accessible through the project website -

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) has emerged as a transformative technology,
demonstrating remarkable capabilities across diverse application domains.
However, GenAI faces several major challenges in developing reliable and
efficient GenAI-empowered systems due to its unpredictability and inefficiency.
This paper advocates for a paradigm shift: future GenAI-native systems should
integrate GenAI's cognitive capabilities with traditional software engineering
principles to create robust, adaptive, and efficient systems.
  We introduce foundational GenAI-native design principles centered around five
key pillars -- reliability, excellence, evolvability, self-reliance, and
assurance -- and propose architectural patterns such as GenAI-native cells,
organic substrates, and programmable routers to guide the creation of resilient
and self-evolving systems. Additionally, we outline the key ingredients of a
GenAI-native software stack and discuss the impact of these systems from
technical, user adoption, economic, and legal perspectives, underscoring the
need for further validation and experimentation. Our work aims to inspire
future research and encourage relevant communities to implement and refine this
conceptual framework.

Conclusion: ICGS-Quantizer在压缩效率和场景适应性方面均超越现有方法，支持大规模场景长期存档

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted considerable attention for
enabling high-quality real-time rendering. Although 3DGS compression methods
have been proposed for deployment on storage-constrained devices, two
limitations hinder archival use: (1) they compress medium-scale scenes only to
the megabyte range, which remains impractical for large-scale scenes or
extensive scene collections; and (2) they lack mechanisms to accommodate scene
changes after long-term archival. To address these limitations, we propose an
Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) that substantially
enhances compression efficiency and provides adaptability to scene changes
after archiving. ICGS-Quantizer improves quantization efficiency by jointly
exploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and by using shared
codebooks across all training scenes, which are then fixed and applied to
previously unseen test scenes, eliminating the overhead of per-scene codebooks.
This approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3DGS to the
kilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity. To enable adaptability to
post-archival scene changes, ICGS-Quantizer conditions scene decoding on images
captured at decoding time. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes
are trained jointly, ensuring that the codes, which are quantized
representations of the scene, are effective for conditional decoding. We
evaluate ICGS-Quantizer on 3D scene compression and 3D scene updating.
Experimental results show that ICGS-Quantizer consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in compression efficiency and adaptability to scene
changes. Our code, model, and data will be publicly available on GitHub.

Conclusion: 该框架使生成模型能够输出具有协同效应的样本群体，为创意工作流提供更丰富的选择空间，推动了生成式AI从单样本优化向群体优化的范式转变。

Abstract: Generative models typically sample outputs independently, and recent
inference-time guidance and scaling algorithms focus on improving the quality
of individual samples. However, in real-world applications, users are often
presented with a set of multiple images (e.g., 4-8) for each prompt, where
independent sampling tends to lead to redundant results, limiting user choices
and hindering idea exploration. In this work, we introduce a scalable group
inference method that improves both the diversity and quality of a group of
samples. We formulate group inference as a quadratic integer assignment
problem: candidate outputs are modeled as graph nodes, and a subset is selected
to optimize sample quality (unary term) while maximizing group diversity
(binary term). To substantially improve runtime efficiency, we progressively
prune the candidate set using intermediate predictions, allowing our method to
scale up to large candidate sets. Extensive experiments show that our method
significantly improves group diversity and quality compared to independent
sampling baselines and recent inference algorithms. Our framework generalizes
across a wide range of tasks, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image
prompting, and video generation, enabling generative models to treat multiple
outputs as cohesive groups rather than independent samples.

Conclusion: RAGAN通过生成高迁移性/隐蔽性的虚假画像，为评估推荐系统鲁棒性提供新视角

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that recommender systems (RSs) are highly
vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, where malicious actors inject fake user
profiles, including a group of well-designed fake ratings, to manipulate
recommendations. Due to security and privacy constraints in practice, attackers
typically possess limited knowledge of the victim system and thus need to craft
profiles that have transferability across black-box RSs. To maximize the attack
impact, the profiles often remains imperceptible. However, generating such
high-quality profiles with the restricted resources is challenging. Some works
suggest incorporating fake textual reviews to strengthen the profiles; yet, the
poor quality of the reviews largely undermines the attack effectiveness and
imperceptibility under the practical setting.
  To tackle the above challenges, in this paper, we propose to enhance the
quality of the review text by harnessing in-context learning (ICL) capabilities
of multimodal foundation models. To this end, we introduce a demonstration
retrieval algorithm and a text style transfer strategy to augment the navie
ICL. Specifically, we propose a novel practical attack framework named RAGAN to
generate high-quality fake user profiles, which can gain insights into the
robustness of RSs. The profiles are generated by a jailbreaker and
collaboratively optimized on an instructional agent and a guardian to improve
the attack transferability and imperceptibility. Comprehensive experiments on
various real-world datasets demonstrate that RAGAN achieves the
state-of-the-art poisoning attack performance.

TL;DR: Proposes IPIGuard defense framework using Tool Dependency Graphs to mitigate Indirect Prompt Injection attacks on LLM agents by decoupling action planning from external interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defenses rely on insecure assumptions about LLMs' inherent security, allowing attackers to bypass guardrails through malicious tool invocations in external data.

Method: Models agent tasks as traversals over Tool Dependency Graphs (TDG), explicitly separating action planning from interactions with untrusted external data sources.

Result: IPIGuard achieves state-of-the-art robustness on AgentDojo benchmark (0.82 success rate vs 0.31 baseline) while maintaining 97% effectiveness compared to undefended systems.

Conclusion: Demonstrates structured task planning through TDG significantly enhances LLM agent security against indirect prompt injections, enabling safer deployment in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are widely deployed in real-world
applications, where they leverage tools to retrieve and manipulate external
data for complex tasks. However, when interacting with untrusted data sources
(e.g., fetching information from public websites), tool responses may contain
injected instructions that covertly influence agent behaviors and lead to
malicious outcomes, a threat referred to as Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI).
Existing defenses typically rely on advanced prompting strategies or auxiliary
detection models. While these methods have demonstrated some effectiveness,
they fundamentally rely on assumptions about the model's inherent security,
which lacks structural constraints on agent behaviors. As a result, agents
still retain unrestricted access to tool invocations, leaving them vulnerable
to stronger attack vectors that can bypass the security guardrails of the
model. To prevent malicious tool invocations at the source, we propose a novel
defensive task execution paradigm, called IPIGuard, which models the agents'
task execution process as a traversal over a planned Tool Dependency Graph
(TDG). By explicitly decoupling action planning from interaction with external
data, IPIGuard significantly reduces unintended tool invocations triggered by
injected instructions, thereby enhancing robustness against IPI attacks.
Experiments on the AgentDojo benchmark show that IPIGuard achieves a superior
balance between effectiveness and robustness, paving the way for the
development of safer agentic systems in dynamic environments.
