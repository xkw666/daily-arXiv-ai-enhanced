We propose a novel\nyet efficient method to compute Voronoi diagrams bounded by a given domain,\ni.e., the clipped or restricted Voronoi diagrams. The intersection of the\ndomain and a Voronoi cell (domain-cell intersection) is generated by removing\nthe part outside the cell from the domain, which can be accomplished by several\nclippings. Different from the existing methods, we present an edge-based search\nscheme to find clipping planes (bisectors). A test called point-in-cell is\nfirst set up to tell whether a space point is in a target Voronoi cell or not.\nThen, for each edge of the intermediate domain-cell intersection, we will\nlaunch a clipping only if its two endpoints are respectively inside and outside\nthe corresponding Voronoi cell, where the bisector for the clipping can be\nfound by using a few times of point-in-cell tests. Therefore, our method only\ninvolves the clippings that contribute to the final results, which is a great\nadvantage over the state-of-the-art methods.

However, existing neural radiosity\nmethods, which primarily rely on positional feature encoding, exhibit notable\nlimitations in capturing these high-frequency, strongly view-dependent radiance\ndistributions. To address this, we propose a highly-efficient approach by\nreflectance-aware ray cone encoding based on the neural radiosity framework,\nnamed neural cone radiosity. The core idea is to employ a pre-filtered\nmulti-resolution hash grid to accurately approximate the glossy BSDF lobe,\nembedding view-dependent reflectance characteristics directly into the encoding\nprocess through continuous spatial aggregation. Our design not only\nsignificantly improves the network's ability to model high-frequency reflection\ndistributions but also effectively handles surfaces with a wide range of\nglossiness levels, from highly glossy to low-gloss finishes.

Building on DS-TF1-EN-3M (TF1), the\nlargest collection of synthetic English fables to date, we address the need for\nrich, high quality literary datasets in low resource languages such as\nRomanian. Our pipeline first generates 15k high quality Romanian references\nfrom the TF1 pool using a high performing LLM. We then apply a two stage fine\ntuning process to a 12B parameter open weight model: (i) instruction tuning to\ncapture genre specific narrative style, and (ii) adapter compression for\nefficient deployment. Evaluation combines corpus level BLEU and a five\ndimension LLM based rubric (accuracy, fluency, coherence, style, cultural\nadaptation) to provide a nuanced assessment of translation quality. Results\nshow that our fine tuned model achieves fluency and adequacy competitive with\ntop performing large proprietary models, while being open, accessible, and\nsignificantly more cost effective. Alongside the fine tuned model and both\ndatasets, we publicly release all scripts and evaluation prompts. TF2 thus\nprovides an end-to-end, reproducible pipeline for research on cost efficient\ntranslation, cross lingual narrative generation, and the broad adoption of open\nmodels for culturally significant literary content in low resource settings."}

Yet\nthis progress faces a fundamental bottleneck: the need for ever more data from\nwhich models can continue to learn. In this work, we propose a reinforcement\nlearning approach that removes this dependency by enabling models to improve\nwithout additional data. Our method leverages a game-theoretic framework of\nself-play, where a model's capabilities are cast as performance in a\ncompetitive game and stronger policies emerge by having the model play against\nitself - a process we call Language Self-Play (LSP). Experiments with\nLlama-3.2-3B-Instruct on instruction-following benchmarks show that pretrained\nmodels can not only enhance their performance on challenging tasks through\nself-play alone, but can also do so more effectively than data-driven\nbaselines."}

However, existing CVGL approaches are typically restricted to a\nsingle view or modality, and their direct visual matching strategy lacks\ninterpretability: they merely predict whether two images correspond, without\nexplaining the rationale behind the match. In this paper, we present GLEAM-C, a\nfoundational CVGL model that unifies multiple views and modalities-including\nUAV imagery, street maps, panoramic views, and ground photographs-by aligning\nthem exclusively with satellite imagery. Our framework enhances training\nefficiency through optimized implementation while achieving accuracy comparable\nto prior modality-specific CVGL models through a two-phase training strategy.\nMoreover, to address the lack of interpretability in traditional CVGL methods,\nwe leverage the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models\n(MLLMs) to propose a new task, GLEAM-X, which combines cross-view\ncorrespondence prediction with explainable reasoning. To support this task, we\nconstruct a bilingual benchmark using GPT-4o and Doubao-1.5-Thinking-Vision-Pro\nto generate training and testing data. The test set is further refined through\ndetailed human revision, enabling systematic evaluation of explainable\ncross-view reasoning and advancing transparency and scalability in\ngeo-localization. Together, GLEAM-C and GLEAM-X form a comprehensive CVGL\npipeline that integrates multi-modal, multi-view alignment with interpretable\ncorrespondence analysis, unifying accurate cross-view matching with explainable\nreasoning and advancing Geo-Localization by enabling models to better Explain\nAnd Match.

Efficient kernels are\ncrucial for accelerating large language model (LLM) training and serving, yet\nattaining high performance typically requires extensive manual tuning.\nCompiler-based systems reduce some of this burden, but still demand substantial\nmanual design and engineering effort. Recently, researchers have explored using\nLLMs for GPU kernel generation, though prior work has largely focused on\ntranslating high-level PyTorch modules into CUDA code. In this work, we\nintroduce Astra, the first LLM-based multi-agent system for GPU kernel\noptimization. Unlike previous approaches, Astra starts from existing CUDA\nimplementations extracted from SGLang, a widely deployed framework for serving\nLLMs, rather than treating PyTorch modules as the specification. Within Astra,\nspecialized LLM agents collaborate through iterative code generation, testing,\nprofiling, and planning to produce kernels that are both correct and\nhigh-performance. On kernels from SGLang, Astra achieves an average speedup of\n1.32x using zero-shot prompting with OpenAI o4-mini. A detailed case study\nfurther demonstrates that LLMs can autonomously apply loop transformations,\noptimize memory access patterns, exploit CUDA intrinsics, and leverage fast\nmath operations to yield substantial performance gains.

However, existing\nopen-source approaches often exhibit monotonous reasoning patterns and allow\nonly a limited number of interaction turns, making them inadequate for\ndifficult tasks that require trial-and-error exploration. In this work, we\naddress this limitation by scaling up tool-based interactions and introduce\nMini-o3, a system that executes deep, multi-turn reasoning -- spanning tens of\nsteps -- and achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging visual search\ntasks. Our recipe for reproducing OpenAI o3-style behaviors comprises three key\ncomponents. First, we construct the Visual Probe Dataset, a collection of\nthousands of challenging visual search problems designed for exploratory\nreasoning. Second, we develop an iterative data collection pipeline to obtain\ncold-start trajectories that exhibit diverse reasoning patterns, including\ndepth-first search, trial-and-error, and goal maintenance. Third, we propose an\nover-turn masking strategy that prevents penalization of over-turn responses\n(those that hit the maximum number of turns) during reinforcement learning,\nthereby balancing training-time efficiency with test-time scalability. Despite\ntraining with an upper bound of only six interaction turns, our model generates\ntrajectories that naturally scale to tens of turns at inference time, with\naccuracy improving as the number of turns increases. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that Mini-o3 produces rich reasoning patterns and deep thinking\npaths, effectively solving challenging visual search problems."}
