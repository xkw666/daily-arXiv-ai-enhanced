However,\nthese approaches often struggle with loose-fitting garments due to two key\nlimitations: (1) They rely on human body semantic maps to align garments with\nthe body, but these maps become unreliable when body contours are obscured by\nloose-fitting garments, resulting in degraded outcomes; (2) They train garment\nsynthesis networks on a per-frame basis without utilizing temporal information,\nleading to noticeable jittering artifacts. To address these challenges, we\npropose a two-stage approach for robust semantic map estimation. First, we\nextract a garment-invariant representation from the raw input image. This\nrepresentation is then passed through an auxiliary network to estimate the\nsemantic map. This enhances the robustness of semantic map estimation under\nloose-fitting garments during garment-specific dataset generation. Furthermore,\nwe introduce a recurrent garment synthesis framework that incorporates temporal\ndependencies to improve frame-to-frame coherence while maintaining real-time\nperformance. We conducted qualitative and quantitative evaluations to\ndemonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both image\nquality and temporal coherence. Ablation studies further validate the\neffectiveness of the garment-invariant representation and the recurrent\nsynthesis framework."}

This paper\npresents a novel framework iDiT-HOI that enables in-the-wild HOI reenactment\ngeneration. Specifically, we propose a unified inpainting-based token process\nmethod, called Inp-TPU, with a two-stage video diffusion transformer (DiT)\nmodel. The first stage generates a key frame by inserting the designated object\ninto the hand region, providing a reference for subsequent frames. The second\nstage ensures temporal coherence and fluidity in hand-object interactions.

While sparse attention methods can help reduce\nthe KV cache pressure induced by this long autoregressive reasoning, these\nmethods can introduce errors which disrupt the reasoning process. Additionally,\nprior methods often pre-process the input to make it easier to identify the\nimportant prompt tokens when computing attention during generation, and this\npre-processing is challenging to perform online for newly generated reasoning\ntokens. Our work addresses these challenges by introducing Multipole Attention,\nwhich accelerates autoregressive reasoning by only computing exact attention\nfor the most important tokens, while maintaining approximate representations\nfor the remaining tokens. Our method first performs clustering to group\ntogether semantically similar key vectors, and then uses the cluster centroids\nboth to identify important key vectors and to approximate the remaining key\nvectors in order to retain high accuracy. We design a fast cluster update\nprocess to quickly re-cluster the input and previously generated tokens,\nthereby allowing for accelerating attention to the previous output tokens. We\nevaluate our method using emerging LRMs such as Qwen-8B, demonstrating that our\napproach can maintain accuracy on complex reasoning tasks even with aggressive\nattention sparsity settings.

Recent model\nediting-based approaches enable efficient backdoor injection by directly\nmodifying parameters to map specific triggers to attacker-desired responses.\nHowever, these methods often suffer from safety fallback, where the model\ninitially responds affirmatively but later reverts to refusals due to safety\nalignment. In this work, we propose DualEdit, a dual-objective model editing\nframework that jointly promotes affirmative outputs and suppresses refusal\nresponses. To address two key challenges -- balancing the trade-off between\naffirmative promotion and refusal suppression, and handling the diversity of\nrefusal expressions -- DualEdit introduces two complementary techniques. (1)\nDynamic loss weighting calibrates the objective scale based on the pre-edited\nmodel to stabilize optimization. (2) Refusal value anchoring compresses the\nsuppression target space by clustering representative refusal value vectors,\nreducing optimization conflict from overly diverse token sets.

The modified data serves to refine the latest large language models\nwith various fine-tuning methods, enabling them to accurately provide sentences\nwith both emotional reassurance and constructive suggestions in response to\npatients' questions. Compared to the original LLM model, our experimental\nresults demonstrate that our methodology significantly enhances the model's\nability to generate emotional responses while maintaining its original\ncapability to provide accurate knowledge-based answers."}

To\naddress these challenges, AI Flow has been introduced as a multidisciplinary\nframework that integrates cutting-edge IT and CT advancements, with a\nparticular emphasis on the following three key points.

Concretely, we develop\ncontext-oriented singular value decomposition, where we collect covariance\nmatrices of input activations for each linear layer using sampled data from the\ntarget task, and apply SVD to the product of weight matrix and its\ncorresponding covariance matrix. By doing so, the task-specific capability is\ncompacted into the principal components.

We further develop CorDA++ by\nderiving a metric that reflects the compactness of task-specific principal\ncomponents, and then introducing dynamic covariance selection and dynamic rank\nallocation strategies based on the same metric. The two strategies provide each\nlayer with the most representative covariance matrix and a proper rank\nallocation. Experimental results show that CorDA++ outperforms CorDA by a\nsignificant margin.

For vision that is\nsemantically complementary to text, Stream-Omni uses sequence-dimension\nconcatenation to achieve vision-text alignment. For speech that is semantically\nconsistent with text, Stream-Omni introduces a CTC-based layer-dimension\nmapping to achieve speech-text alignment. In this way, Stream-Omni can achieve\nmodality alignments with less data (especially speech), enabling the transfer\nof text capabilities to other modalities. Experiments on various benchmarks\ndemonstrate that Stream-Omni achieves strong performance on visual\nunderstanding, speech interaction, and vision-grounded speech interaction\ntasks. Owing to the layer-dimensional mapping, Stream-Omni can simultaneously\nprovide intermediate text outputs (such as ASR transcriptions and model\nresponses) during speech interaction, offering users a comprehensive multimodal\nexperience."}

Recent works in\neXplainable AI (XAI), particularly on attribution methods, suggest that\ninterpretability can also enable model compression by identifying and removing\ncomponents irrelevant to inference. In this paper, we leverage Layer-wise\nRelevance Propagation (LRP) to perform attribution-guided pruning of LLMs.\nWhile LRP has shown promise in structured pruning for vision models, we extend\nit to unstructured pruning in LLMs and demonstrate that it can substantially\nreduce model size with minimal performance loss. Our method is especially\neffective in extracting task-relevant subgraphs -- so-called ``circuits'' --\nwhich can represent core functions (e.g., indirect object identification).\nBuilding on this, we introduce a technique for model correction, by selectively\nremoving circuits responsible for spurious behaviors (e.g., toxic outputs). All\nin all, we gather these techniques as a uniform holistic framework and showcase\nits effectiveness and limitations through extensive experiments for\ncompression, circuit discovery and model correction on Llama and OPT models,\nhighlighting its potential for improving both model efficiency and safety.
