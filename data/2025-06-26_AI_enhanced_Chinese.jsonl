The saccades are modeled using a Hawkes\nprocess, which captures how each fixation excites the probability of a new\nfixation occurring near it in time and space. The duration time of fixation\nevents is modeled as a function of fixation-specific predictors convolved\nacross time, thus capturing spillover effects. Empirically, our Hawkes process\nmodel exhibits a better fit to human saccades than baselines.

We review and compare\nthree mainstream autoencoder architectures-Variational AutoEncoder (VAE),\nVector Quantised VAE (VQVAE), and Sparse AutoEncoder (SAE)-and examine the\ndistinctive latent geometries they induce in relation to semantic structure and\ninterpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u7ec4\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u8bed\u4e49\u878d\u5165\u5206\u5e03\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83VAE/VQVAE/SAE\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u7b26\u53f7\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u5206\u5e03\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u5272\u88c2\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u6765\u589e\u5f3aTransformer\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3001\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e09\u79cd\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668VAE\u3001\u77e2\u91cf\u91cf\u5316VAE\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668SAE\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u5173\u8054\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u4e0d\u540c\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u8868\u8fbe\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff1aVQVAE\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u6563\u7f16\u7801\u589e\u5f3a\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\uff0cSAE\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u8868\u5f81\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0cVAE\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u66f4\u5177\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u8fde\u63a5\u7b26\u53f7\u4e0e\u5206\u5e03\u8bed\u4e49\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\u9009\u62e9\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u53ef\u63a7\u5236\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdb\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Materials and\nMethods: A retrospective analysis was performed on 1,000 consecutive radiology\nreports (250 each: radiography, ultrasonography, CT, MRI) from the MIMIC-III\ndatabase. Two external datasets (CheXpert and Open-i) were validation sets.\nThree LLM frameworks were tested: (1) single-prompt detector; (2) extractor\nplus detector; and (3) extractor, detector, and false-positive verifier.\nPrecision was measured by PPV and absolute true positive rate (aTPR).\nEfficiency was calculated from model inference charges and reviewer\nremuneration.

This modular\narchitecture decouples representation learning from inference, enabling\nefficient alignment between numerical patterns and semantic reasoning.\nEmpirical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves consistent\nimprovements over strong baselines, and comparative studies on various datasets\nconfirm SEED's role in addressing the structural-semantic modeling gap.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSEED\u7ed3\u6784\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u6620\u5c04\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7ed3\u6784\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5272\u88c2\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7ed3\u6784\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7edf\u4e00\u9884\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u53d1\u53d7\u9650\u3002SEED\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "method": "\u56db\u9636\u6bb5\u67b6\u6784\uff1a1) Token-aware\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u63d0\u53d6\u65f6\u95f4\u7247\u6bb5\uff1b2) \u6295\u5f71\u6a21\u5757\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5d4c\u5165\uff1b3) \u8bed\u4e49\u91cd\u7f16\u7a0b\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u4efb\u52a1\u539f\u578b\uff1b4) \u51bb\u7ed3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u5b9e\u73b0\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aSEED\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784-\u8bed\u4e49\u534f\u540c\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5176\u80fd\u5f25\u5408\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u9e3f\u6c9f\u3002", "conclusion": "SEED\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7ed3\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

By applying this\nframework to a large dataset of video-chats between strangers, we confirm that,\nperhaps unsurprisingly, different conversation-level distributions of talk-time\nare perceived differently by speakers, with balanced conversations being\npreferred over imbalanced ones, especially by those who end up talking less.\nThen we reveal that -- even when they lead to the same level of overall balance\n-- different types of talk-time sharing dynamics are perceived differently by\nthe participants, highlighting the relevance of our newly introduced typology.\nFinally, we discuss how our framework offers new tools to designers of\ncomputer-mediated communication platforms, for both human-human and human-AI\ncommunication.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u8c08\u8bdd\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u914d\u52a8\u6001\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5f71\u54cd", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u8c08\u8bdd\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u914d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u673a\u5236\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u4ea4\u6d41\u4f53\u9a8c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5e95\u5c42\u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5c42\u9762\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u5fae\u89c2\u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u964c\u751f\u4eba\u89c6\u9891\u804a\u5929\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1", "result": "\u5e73\u8861\u5bf9\u8bdd\u66f4\u53d7\u504f\u597d\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u5bf9\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8f83\u5c11\u8005\uff09\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6574\u4f53\u5e73\u8861\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u52a8\u6001\u7c7b\u578b\u4ecd\u5bfc\u81f4\u611f\u77e5\u5dee\u5f02", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u901a\u4fe1\u5e73\u53f0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4eba\u673a/\u4eba\u4eba\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u6790"}}

The global planning and iterative refinement features of dLLMs\nare particularly useful for code generation.

To demystify\nthe decoding behavior of dLLMs and unlock their potential for coding, we\nsystematically investigate their denoising processes and reinforcement learning\n(RL) methods. We train a 7B dLLM, \\textbf{DiffuCoder}, on 130B tokens of code.\nUsing this model as a testbed, we analyze its decoding behavior, revealing how\nit differs from that of AR models: (1) dLLMs can decide how causal their\ngeneration should be without relying on semi-AR decoding, and (2) increasing\nthe sampling temperature diversifies not only token choices but also their\ngeneration order. This diversity creates a rich search space for RL rollouts.\nFor RL training, to reduce the variance of token log-likelihood estimates and\nmaintain training efficiency, we propose \\textbf{coupled-GRPO}, a novel\nsampling scheme that constructs complementary mask noise for completions used\nin training. In our experiments, coupled-GRPO significantly improves\nDiffuCoder's performance on code generation benchmarks (+4.4\\% on EvalPlus) and\nreduces reliance on AR causal during decoding.

These value trade-offs are an\nintegral part of human decision-making and language use, however, current tools\nfor interpreting such dynamic and multi-faceted notions of values in LLMs are\nlimited. In cognitive science, so-called \"cognitive models\" provide formal\naccounts of these trade-offs in humans, by modeling the weighting of a\nspeaker's competing utility functions in choosing an action or utterance. In\nthis work, we use a leading cognitive model of polite speech to interpret the\nextent to which LLMs represent human-like trade-offs. We apply this lens to\nsystematically evaluate value trade-offs in two encompassing model settings:\ndegrees of reasoning \"effort\" in frontier black-box models, and RL\npost-training dynamics of open-source models.

Commercial Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and\nDeepSeek, require substantial resources, while the utilization of these systems\nfor medical purposes raises critical issues regarding patient privacy and\nsafety. Methods We developed a customizable Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG) framework for medical tasks, which monitors its energy usage and CO2\nemissions. This system was then used to create RAGs based on various\nopen-source LLMs. The tested models included both general purpose models like\nllama3.1:8b and medgemma-4b-it, which is medical-domain specific. The best RAGs\nperformance and energy consumption was compared to DeepSeekV3-R1 and OpenAIs\no4-mini model. A dataset of medical questions was used for the evaluation.\nResults Custom RAG models outperformed commercial models in accuracy and energy\nconsumption. The RAG model built on llama3.1:8B achieved the highest accuracy\n(58.5%) and was significantly better than other models, including o4-mini and\nDeepSeekV3-R1. The llama3.1-RAG also exhibited the lowest energy consumption\nand CO2 footprint among all models, with a Performance per kWh of 0.52 and a\ntotal CO2 emission of 473g. Compared to o4-mini, the llama3.1-RAG achieved 2.7x\ntimes more accuracy points per kWh and 172% less electricity usage while\nmaintaining higher accuracy. Conclusion Our study demonstrates that local LLMs\ncan be leveraged to develop RAGs that outperform commercial, online LLMs in\nmedical tasks, while having a smaller environmental impact.

In the e-NDP dataset, Co-DETR achieves state-of-the-art results\n(0.752 mAP@.50:.95), closely followed by YOLOv11X-OBB (0.721). Conversely, on\nthe more complex CATMuS and HORAE datasets, the CNN-based YOLOv11x-OBB\nsignificantly outperforms all other models (0.564 and 0.568, respectively).\nThis study unequivocally demonstrates that using Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBB)\nis not a minor refinement but a fundamental requirement for accurately modeling\nthe non-Cartesian nature of historical manuscripts.

Existing approaches such as\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and prompt engineered search agents rely\non rigid pipelines, often leading to inefficient or excessive search behaviors.\nWe present MMSearch-R1, the first end-to-end reinforcement learning framework\nthat enables LMMs to perform on-demand, multi-turn search in real-world\nInternet environments. Our framework integrates both image and text search\ntools, allowing the model to reason about when and how to invoke them guided by\nan outcome-based reward with a search penalty. To support training, We collect\na multimodal search VQA dataset through a semi-automated pipeline that covers\ndiverse visual and textual knowledge needs and curate a search-balanced subset\nwith both search-required and search-free samples, which proves essential for\nshaping efficient and on-demand search behavior. Extensive experiments on\nknowledge-intensive and info-seeking VQA tasks show that our model not only\noutperforms RAG-based baselines of the same model size, but also matches the\nperformance of a larger RAG-based model while reducing search calls by over\n30%.
