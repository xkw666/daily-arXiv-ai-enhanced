However, the current landscape supports\nonly a limited set of certifiers, and developing new ones or modifying existing\nones for different applications remains difficult. This is because the\nmathematical design of certifiers is expressed at the neuron level, while their\nimplementations are optimized and executed at the tensor level. This mismatch\ncreates a semantic gap between design and implementation, making manual\nbridging both complex and expertise-intensive -- requiring deep knowledge in\nformal methods, high-performance computing, etc.\n  We propose a compiler framework that automatically translates neuron-level\nspecifications of DNN certifiers into tensor-based, layer-level\nimplementations. This is enabled by two key innovations: a novel stack-based\nintermediate representation (IR) and a shape analysis that infers the implicit\ntensor operations needed to simulate the neuron-level semantics. During\nlifting, the shape analysis creates tensors in the minimal shape required to\nperform the corresponding operations. The IR also enables domain-specific\noptimizations as rewrites. At runtime, the resulting tensor computations\nexhibit sparsity tied to the DNN architecture. This sparsity does not align\nwell with existing formats. To address this, we introduce g-BCSR, a\ndouble-compression format that represents tensors as collections of blocks of\nvarying sizes, each possibly internally sparse.\n  Using our compiler and g-BCSR, we make it easy to develop new certifiers and\nanalyze their utility across diverse DNNs. Despite its flexibility, the\ncompiler achieves performance comparable to hand-optimized implementations."}

This paper presents two\ncore contributions to advancing DA-MSA translation for the Levantine, Egyptian,\nand Gulf dialects, particularly in low-resource and computationally constrained\nsettings: a comprehensive evaluation of training-free prompting techniques, and\nthe development of a resource-efficient fine-tuning pipeline. Our evaluation of\nprompting strategies across six large language models (LLMs) found that\nfew-shot prompting consistently outperformed zero-shot, chain-of-thought, and\nour proposed Ara-TEaR method. GPT-4o achieved the highest performance across\nall prompting settings. For fine-tuning, a quantized Gemma2-9B model achieved a\nCHrF++ score of 49.88, outperforming zero-shot GPT-4o (44.58). Joint\nmulti-dialect trained models outperformed single-dialect counterparts by over\n10% CHrF++, and 4-bit quantization reduced memory usage by 60% with less than\n1% performance loss.

Additionally, we assess the\nfeasibility of conducting recovery training with only a small fraction of the\navailable data. Our results show that widthwise pruning generally maintains\nbetter performance in low-resource scenarios with limited computational\nresources or insufficient finetuning data. As for the recovery training,\nfinetuning only the multimodal projector is sufficient at small compression\nlevels (< 20%). Furthermore, a combination of supervised finetuning and\nhidden-state distillation yields optimal recovery across various pruning\nlevels. Notably, effective recovery can be achieved with as little as 5% of the\noriginal training data, while retaining over 95% of the original performance.\nThrough empirical study on two representative MLLMs, i.e., LLaVA-v1.5-7B and\nBunny-v1.0-3B, this study offers actionable insights for practitioners aiming\nto compress MLLMs effectively without extensive computation resources or\nsufficient data."}

To bridge this gap, we propose Agentic Reinforced\nPolicy Optimization (ARPO), a novel agentic RL algorithm tailored for training\nmulti-turn LLM-based agents. Through preliminary experiments, we observe that\nLLMs tend to exhibit highly uncertain behavior, characterized by an increase in\nthe entropy distribution of generated tokens, immediately following\ninteractions with external tools. Motivated by this observation, ARPO\nincorporates an entropy-based adaptive rollout mechanism, dynamically balancing\nglobal trajectory sampling and step-level sampling, thereby promoting\nexploration at steps with high uncertainty after tool usage. By integrating an\nadvantage attribution estimation, ARPO enables LLMs to internalize advantage\ndifferences in stepwise tool-use interactions. Our experiments across 13\nchallenging benchmarks in computational reasoning, knowledge reasoning, and\ndeep search domains demonstrate ARPO's superiority over trajectory-level RL\nalgorithms.

Purpose: To develop and evaluate large language models\n(LLMs) that automatically extract PCL features from MRI/CT reports and assign\nrisk categories based on guidelines. Materials and Methods: We curated a\ntraining dataset of 6,000 abdominal MRI/CT reports (2005-2024) from 5,134\npatients that described PCLs. Labels were generated by GPT-4o using\nchain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to extract PCL and main pancreatic duct\nfeatures.

During post-training, K2 undergoes a multi-stage post-training\nprocess, highlighted by a large-scale agentic data synthesis pipeline and a\njoint reinforcement learning (RL) stage, where the model improves its\ncapabilities through interactions with real and synthetic environments.\n  Kimi K2 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source non-thinking\nmodels, with strengths in agentic capabilities. Notably, K2 obtains 66.1 on\nTau2-Bench, 76.5 on ACEBench (En), 65.8 on SWE-Bench Verified, and 47.3 on\nSWE-Bench Multilingual -- surpassing most open and closed-sourced baselines in\nnon-thinking settings. It also exhibits strong capabilities in coding,\nmathematics, and reasoning tasks, with a score of 53.7 on LiveCodeBench v6,\n49.5 on AIME 2025, 75.1 on GPQA-Diamond, and 27.1 on OJBench, all without\nextended thinking. These results position Kimi K2 as one of the most capable\nopen-source large language models to date, particularly in software engineering\nand agentic tasks. We release our base and post-trained model checkpoints to\nfacilitate future research and applications of agentic intelligence."}

Inspired by \"Thinking, Fast and Slow,\" which characterizes\ntwo distinct modes of thought-System 1 (fast, intuitive, often automatic) and\nSystem 2 (slower, more deliberative and analytic)-we draw an analogy that\ndifferent \"subregions\" of an LLM's parameters might similarly specialize for\ntasks that demand quick, intuitive responses versus those requiring multi-step\nlogical reasoning. Therefore, we propose LoRA-PAR, a dual-system LoRA framework\nthat partitions both data and parameters by System 1 or System 2 demands, using\nfewer yet more focused parameters for each task.
