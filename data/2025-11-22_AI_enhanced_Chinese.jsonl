To assess these properties across languages, we applied two complementary attribution methods--ContextCite for step-level attribution and Inseq for token-level attribution--to the Qwen2.5 1.5B-Instruct model using the MGSM benchmark. Our experimental results highlight key findings such as: (1) attribution scores excessively emphasize the final reasoning step, particularly in incorrect generations; (2) structured CoT prompting significantly improves accuracy primarily for high-resource Latin-script languages; and (3) controlled perturbations via negation and distractor sentences reduce model accuracy and attribution coherence. These findings highlight the limitations of CoT prompting, particularly in terms of multilingual robustness and interpretive transparency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00LLM\u4e2d\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u504f\u5dee\uff1a\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5173\u6ce8\u6700\u540e\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u3001\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u53d7\u76ca\u660e\u663e\u3001\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u80fd\u529b\u8584\u5f31\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63d0\u793a\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u903b\u8f91\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528ContextCite\uff08\u6b65\u9aa4\u5f52\u56e0\uff09\u548cInseq\uff08\u6807\u8bb0\u5f52\u56e0\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eQwen2.5 1.5B-Instruct\u6a21\u578b\u5728MGSM\u57fa\u51c6\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "1.\u9519\u8bef\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6700\u540e\u6b65\u9aa4\n2.CoT\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u62c9\u4e01\u8bed\u7cfb\u51c6\u786e\u7387\n3.\u5e72\u6270\u8bed\u53e5\u663e\u8457\u7834\u574f\u6a21\u578b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027", "conclusion": "\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63d0\u793a\u5b58\u5728\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u89e3\u91ca\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5747\u8861\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

To address this gap and systematically benchmark LLMs' instruction-following capabilities, we propose TOD-ProcBench, a challenging benchmark featuring complex process instructions with intricate, fine-grained constraints that evaluates various LLMs' abilities to understand and follow instructions in multi-turn TODs. Our benchmark dataset comprises instruction documents derived from the high-quality ABCD dataset with corresponding conversations under human quality control. We formulate fine-grained constraints and action procedures as multi-level condition-action instruction statements. We design three tasks to comprehensively benchmark LLMs' complex instruction-following capabilities in multi-turn TODs. Task 1 evaluates how LLMs retrieve the most relevant statement from a complex instruction and predict the corresponding next action. In Task 2, we synthesize instruction-violating responses by injecting inconsistencies and manipulating the original instructions, and then we analyze how effectively LLMs can identify instruction-violating responses. Task 3 investigates LLMs' abilities in conditional generation of instruction-following responses based on the original complex instructions. Additionally, we conduct studies on the impact of multilingual settings and different instruction text formats on compliance performance.

These constraints may depend on future tokens, which makes directly conditioning an autoregressive language model (LM) generally intractable. Prior work uses tractable surrogates such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) to approximate the distribution over continuations and adjust the model's next-token logits at decoding time. However, we find that these surrogates are often weakly context aware, which reduces query quality. We propose Learning to Look Ahead (LTLA), a hybrid approach that pairs the same base language model for rich prefix encoding with a fixed tractable surrogate model that computes exact continuation probabilities. Two efficiency pitfalls arise when adding neural context: (i) naively rescoring the prefix with every candidate next token requires a sweep over the entire vocabulary at each step, and (ii) predicting fresh surrogate parameters for each prefix, although tractable at a single step, forces recomputation of future probabilities for every new prefix and eliminates reuse. LTLA avoids both by using a single batched HMM update to account for all next-token candidates at once, and by conditioning only the surrogate's latent state prior on the LM's hidden representations while keeping the surrogate decoder fixed, so computations can be reused across prefixes. Empirically, LTLA attains higher conditional likelihood than an unconditional HMM, approximates continuation distributions for vision-language models where a standalone HMM cannot encode visual context, and improves constraint satisfaction at comparable fluency on controlled-generation tasks, with minimal inference overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLTLA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u7840\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u56fa\u5b9a\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u53d7\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709HMM\u7b49\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u5f31\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u67e5\u8be2\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8bcd\u6c47\u904d\u5386\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u65e0\u6cd5\u590d\u7528\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u7801\u524d\u7f00+\u56fa\u5b9a\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cbe\u786e\u540e\u7eed\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u6b21\u6279\u5904\u7406HMM\u66f4\u65b0\u907f\u514d\u9010\u8bcd\u904d\u5386\uff0c\u56fa\u5b9a\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u53c2\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u524d\u7f00\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u7528\u3002", "result": "LTLA\u6761\u4ef6\u4f3c\u7136\u4f18\u4e8eHMM\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5728\u53d7\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u5ea6\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u6d41\u7545\u6027\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u6781\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "LTLA\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u53d7\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u901a\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

In practical workflows, designers typically generate and edit each RGBA layer independently before compositing them into a final raster image. However, this process is irreversible: once composited, layer-level editing is no longer possible. Existing methods commonly rely on image matting and inpainting, but remain limited in controllability and segmentation precision. To address these challenges, we propose two key modules: LayerDecompose-DiT (LD-DiT), which decouples image elements into distinct layers and enables fine-grained control; and Multi-Layer Conditional Adapter (MLCA), which injects target image information into multi-layer tokens to achieve precise conditional generation. To enable a comprehensive evaluation, we build a new benchmark and introduce tailored evaluation metrics. Experimental results show that CLD consistently outperforms existing methods in both decomposition quality and controllability. Furthermore, the separated layers produced by CLD can be directly manipulated in commonly used design tools such as PowerPoint, highlighting its practical value and applicability in real-world creative workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u63a7\u5c42\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5CLD\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LD-DiT\u548cMLCA\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u591a\u56fe\u5c42\u5206\u79bb\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u5b9e\u9645\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5de5\u5177\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u56fe\u5c42\u5408\u6210\u540e\u65e0\u6cd5\u9006\u5411\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5c42\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1.

Currently, most AIBM studies are based on the classical Independent Cascade (IC) model, which omits the time factor and thus hinders their applications to time-critical scenarios like political campaigns or public emergencies. More importantly, existing AIBM studies have not investigated in-depth the submodularity of the objective function, resulting in their failure to provide a theoretical lower bound for the problem. To address these challenges, firstly, this paper proposes the Time-Critical Independent Cascade (TC-IC) model, which incorporates time constraints into the classical IC model. Secondly, the Time-Critical Adversarial Influence Blocking Maximization (TC-AIBM) is established to better handle time-critical scenarios. A detailed formulation of the problem is then presented, along with a theoretical proof of its submodularity under three different tie-breaking rules. Finally, a Bidirectional Influence Sampling (BIS) algorithm is proposed to solve the TC-AIBM problem. The submodularity of the objective function guarantees that the BIS can provide an approximation guarantee of\n  to the optimal solution. Comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrated that the proposed BIS algorithm exhibits excellent stability with various negative seeds, time constraints, and tie-breaking rules, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

However, manual prompt engineering is a laborious process, creating a core bottleneck for practical application of LLMs. This phenomenon has led to the emergence of a new research area known as Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO), which develops rapidly in recent years. Existing APO methods such as those based on evolutionary algorithms or trial-and-error approaches realize an efficient and accurate prompt optimization to some extent. However, those researches focus on a single model or algorithm for the generation strategy and optimization process, which limits their performance when handling complex tasks. To address this, we propose a novel framework called Ensemble Learning based Prompt Optimization (ELPO) to achieve more accurate and robust results. Motivated by the idea of ensemble learning, ELPO conducts voting mechanism and introduces shared generation strategies along with different search methods for searching superior prompts.

Specifically, we classify rendering errors into missing-color and occlusion types, then apply targeted corrections via backprojection or foreground splitting guided by cross-view color consistency. Evaluations on Neural 3D Video and Technicolor datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves temporal consistency and achieves state-of-the-art perceptual rendering quality, improving 0.39dB of PSNR on the Technicolor Light Field dataset.

We introduce a new paradigm called Token-Selective PEFT (TS-PEFT), in which a function S selectively applies PEFT modifications to a subset of position indices, potentially enhancing performance on downstream tasks. Our experimental results reveal that the indiscriminate application of PEFT to all indices is not only superfluous, but may also be counterproductive.

The mainstream solution is adversarial training (AT) to improve robustness; however, AT often brings a clean--robustness trade-off and high training/tuning cost, which limits scalability and maintainability in medical imaging. We propose \\emph{Layer-wise Noise-Guided Selective Wavelet Reconstruction (LNG-SWR)}. During training, we inject small, zero-mean noise at multiple layers to learn a frequency-bias prior that steers representations away from noise-sensitive directions. We then apply prior-guided selective wavelet reconstruction on the input/feature branch to achieve frequency adaptation: suppress noise-sensitive bands, enhance directional structures and shape cues, and stabilize boundary responses while maintaining spectral consistency. The framework is backbone-agnostic and adds low additional inference overhead. It can serve as a plug-in enhancement to AT and also improves robustness without AT. On CT and ultrasound datasets, under a unified protocol with PGD-$L_{\\infty}/L_{2}$ and SSAH, LNG-SWR delivers consistent gains on clean Dice/IoU and significantly reduces the performance drop under strong attacks; combining LNG-SWR with AT yields additive gains. When combined with adversarial training, robustness improves further without sacrificing clean accuracy, indicating an engineering-friendly and scalable path to robust segmentation. These results indicate that LNG-SWR provides a simple, effective, and engineering-friendly path to robust medical image segmentation in both adversarial and standard training regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLNG-SWR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u7ea7\u566a\u58f0\u6ce8\u5165\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5c0f\u6ce2\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u5347\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u517c\u5bb9\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e14\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3(AT)\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5e72\u51c0-\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6743\u8861\u548c\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "1. \u591a\u5c42\u7ea7\u566a\u58f0\u6ce8\u5165\u5b66\u4e60\u9891\u7387\u504f\u7f6e\u5148\u9a8c 2. \u57fa\u4e8e\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5c0f\u6ce2\u91cd\u5efa\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f93\u5165/\u7279\u5f81\u9891\u7387\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\u9891\u6bb5\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81", "result": "\u5728CT/\u8d85\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636eDice/IoU(2-5%)\uff0c\u5f3a\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u51cf\u5c1150%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e0eAT\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u53e0\u52a0\u63d0\u5347", "conclusion": "LNG-SWR\u4e3a\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u5de5\u7a0b\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u53cc\u573a\u666f"}}

However, state-of-the-art UQ methods primarily rely on semantic probability distributions or pairwise distances, overlooking latent semantic structural information that could enable more precise uncertainty estimates. This paper presents Semantic Structural Entropy (SeSE), a principled UQ framework that quantifies the inherent semantic uncertainty of LLMs from a structural information perspective for hallucination detection. Specifically, to effectively model semantic spaces, we first develop an adaptively sparsified directed semantic graph construction algorithm that captures directional semantic dependencies while automatically pruning unnecessary connections that introduce negative interference. We then exploit latent semantic structural information through hierarchical abstraction: SeSE is defined as the structural entropy of the optimal semantic encoding tree, formalizing intrinsic uncertainty within semantic spaces after optimal compression. A higher SeSE value corresponds to greater uncertainty, indicating that LLMs are highly likely to generate hallucinations. In addition, to enhance fine-grained UQ in long-form generation -- where existing methods often rely on heuristic sample-and-count techniques -- we extend SeSE to quantify the uncertainty of individual claims by modeling their random semantic interactions, providing theoretically explicable hallucination detection.

Motivated by this, and considering various benefits of mobile device deployment (data privacy, operating without internet connectivity, and potentially faster responses), this paper develops Texture3dgs, an optimized mapping of 3DGS for a mobile GPU. A critical challenge in this area turns out to be optimizing for the two-dimensional (2D) texture cache, which needs to be exploited for faster executions on mobile GPUs. As a sorting method dominates the computations in 3DGS on mobile platforms, the core of Texture3dgs is a novel sorting algorithm where the processing, data movement, and placement are highly optimized for 2D memory. The properties of this algorithm are analyzed in view of a cost model for the texture cache. In addition, we accelerate other steps of the 3DGS algorithm through improved variable layout design and other optimizations.

LLMs are expected to deliver robust performance across diverse tasks, user preferences, and practical scenarios. However, as demands grow, ensuring that LLMs produce responses aligned with human intent remains a foundational challenge. In particular, aligning model behavior effectively and efficiently during inference, without costly retraining or extensive supervision, is both a critical requirement and a non-trivial technical endeavor. To address the challenge, we propose SDA (Steering-Driven Distribution Alignment), a training-free and model-agnostic alignment framework designed for open-source LLMs. SDA dynamically redistributes model output probabilities based on user-defined alignment instructions, enhancing alignment between model behavior and human intents without fine-tuning. The method is lightweight, resource-efficient, and compatible with a wide range of open-source LLMs. It can function independently during inference or be integrated with training-based alignment strategies. Moreover, SDA supports personalized preference alignment, enabling flexible control over the model response behavior. Empirical results demonstrate that SDA consistently improves alignment performance across 8 open-source LLMs with varying scales and diverse origins, evaluated on three key alignment dimensions, helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty (3H).

Although extensively studied, existing UV unwrapping methods frequently struggle with AI-generated meshes, which are typically noisy, bumpy, and poorly conditioned. These methods often produce highly fragmented charts and suboptimal boundaries, introducing artifacts and hindering downstream tasks. We introduce PartUV, a part-based UV unwrapping pipeline that generates significantly fewer, part-aligned charts while maintaining low distortion. Built on top of a recent learning-based part decomposition method PartField, PartUV combines high-level semantic part decomposition with novel geometric heuristics in a top-down recursive framework. It ensures each chart's distortion remains below a user-specified threshold while minimizing the total number of charts. The pipeline integrates and extends parameterization and packing algorithms, incorporates dedicated handling of non-manifold and degenerate meshes, and is extensively parallelized for efficiency. Evaluated across four diverse datasets, including man-made, CAD, AI-generated, and Common Shapes, PartUV outperforms existing tools and recent neural methods in chart count and seam length, achieves comparable distortion, exhibits high success rates on challenging meshes, and enables new applications like part-specific multi-tiles packing.

However, the one-sided reward, focused solely on final correctness, limits its ability to provide detailed supervision over internal reasoning process. This deficiency leads to suboptimal internal reasoning quality, manifesting as issues like over-thinking, under-thinking, redundant-thinking, and disordered-thinking. Inspired by the recent progress in LRM self-rewarding, we introduce self-rewriting framework, where a model rewrites its own reasoning texts, and subsequently learns from the rewritten reasoning to improve the internal thought process quality. For algorithm design, we propose a selective rewriting approach wherein only \"simple\" samples, defined by the model's consistent correctness, are rewritten, thereby preserving all original reward signals of GRPO. For practical implementation, we compile rewriting and vanilla generation within one single batch, maintaining the scalability of the RL algorithm and introducing only ~10% overhead. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks with different model sizes validate the effectiveness of self-rewriting. In terms of the accuracy-length tradeoff, the self-rewriting approach achieves improved accuracy (+0.6) with substantially shorter reasoning (-46%) even without explicit instructions in rewriting prompts to reduce reasoning length, outperforming existing strong baselines. In terms of internal reasoning quality, self-rewriting achieves significantly higher scores (+7.2) under the LLM-as-a-judge metric, successfully mitigating internal reasoning flaws.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u6211\u91cd\u5199\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u601d\u7ef4\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u91cd\u5199\u4fdd\u6301\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u5e76\u51cf\u5c1146%\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u7ed3\u679c\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u51fa\u73b0\u8fc7\u5ea6\u601d\u8003/\u601d\u8003\u4e0d\u8db3/\u5197\u4f59\u63a8\u7406\u7b49\u5185\u90e8\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u91cd\u5199\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u4ec5\u91cd\u5199\u6a21\u578b\u6301\u7eed\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u6837\u672c\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6279\u91cf\u5e76\u884c\u751f\u6210\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ea610%\u7684\u989d\u5916\u5f00\u9500", "result": "\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387-\u957f\u5ea6\u6743\u8861\u4e2d\u63d0\u53470.6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u540c\u65f6\u7f29\u77ed46%\u63a8\u7406\uff0cLLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u53477.2\u5206", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u6211\u91cd\u5199\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8d28\u91cf"}}

Please cite the conference proceedings when available", "summary": "Human explanations of natural language, rationales, form a tool to assess whether models learn a label for the right reasons or rely on dataset-specific shortcuts. Sufficiency is a common metric for estimating the informativeness of rationales, but it provides limited insight into the effects of rationale information on model performance. We address this limitation by relating sufficiency to two modelling paradigms: the ability of models to identify which tokens are part of the rationale (through token classification) and the ability of improving model performance by incorporating rationales in the input (through attention regularisation). We find that highly informative rationales are not likely to help classify the instance correctly. Sufficiency conversely captures the classification impact of the non-rationalised context, which interferes with rationale information in the same input. We also find that incorporating rationale information in model inputs can boost cross-domain classification, but results are inconsistent per task and model type. Finally, sufficiency and token classification appear to be unrelated.

Existing web corpora rely on heuristic-based extractors like Trafilatura, which struggle to preserve document structure and frequently corrupt structured elements such as formulas, codes, and tables. We hypothesize that improving extraction quality can be as impactful as aggressive filtering strategies for downstream performance. We introduce MinerU-HTML, a novel extraction pipeline that reformulates content extraction as a sequence labeling problem solved by a 0.6B-parameter language model. Unlike text-density heuristics, MinerU-HTML leverages semantic understanding and employs a two-stage formatting pipeline that explicitly categorizes semantic elements before converting to Markdown. Crucially, its model-based approach is inherently scalable, whereas heuristic methods offer limited improvement pathways. On MainWebBench, our benchmark of 7,887 annotated web pages, MinerU-HTML achieves 81.8\\% ROUGE-N F1 compared to Trafilatura's 63.6\\%, with exceptional structured element preservation (90.9\\% for code blocks, 94.0\\% for formulas). Using MinerU-HTML, we construct AICC (AI-ready Common Crawl), a 7.3-trillion token multilingual corpus from two Common Crawl snapshots. In controlled pretraining experiments where AICC and Trafilatura-extracted TfCC undergo identical filtering, models trained on AICC (62B tokens) achieve 50.8\\% average accuracy across 13 benchmarks, outperforming TfCC by 1.08pp-providing direct evidence that extraction quality significantly impacts model capabilities.

Dense bi-encoders currently dominate Turkish IR, yet late-interaction models -- which retain token-level representations for fine-grained matching -- have not been systematically evaluated. We introduce TurkColBERT, the first comprehensive benchmark comparing dense encoders and late-interaction models for Turkish retrieval. Our two-stage adaptation pipeline fine-tunes English and multilingual encoders on Turkish NLI/STS tasks, then converts them into ColBERT-style retrievers using PyLate trained on MS MARCO-TR. We evaluate 10 models across five Turkish BEIR datasets covering scientific, financial, and argumentative domains. Results show strong parameter efficiency: the 1.0M-parameter colbert-hash-nano-tr is 600$\\times$ smaller than the 600M turkish-e5-large dense encoder while preserving over 71\\% of its average mAP. Late-interaction models that are 3--5$\\times$ smaller than dense encoders significantly outperform them; ColmmBERT-base-TR yields up to +13.8\\% mAP on domain-specific tasks. For production-readiness, we compare indexing algorithms: MUVERA+Rerank is 3.33$\\times$ faster than PLAID and offers +1.7\\% relative mAP gain. This enables low-latency retrieval, with ColmmBERT-base-TR achieving 0.54 ms query times under MUVERA. We release all checkpoints, configs, and evaluation scripts. Limitations include reliance on moderately sized datasets ($\\leq$50K documents) and translated benchmarks, which may not fully reflect real-world Turkish retrieval conditions; larger-scale MUVERA evaluations remain necessary.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u571f\u8033\u5176\u8bed\u68c0\u7d22\u7efc\u5408\u57fa\u51c6TurkColBERT\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u540e\u671f\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bc6\u96c6\u7f16\u7801\u5668", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u571f\u8033\u5176\u8bed\u7b49\u5f62\u6001\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5c0f\u8bed\u79cd\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6848", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u9002\u914d\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u5148\u5728NLI/STS\u4efb\u52a1\u5fae\u8c03\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7PyLate\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f6c\u4e3aColBERT\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f305\u4e2a\u9886\u57df10\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b", "result": "1M\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4600M\u6a21\u578b\u5c0f600\u500d\u4fdd\u755971%\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u540e\u671f\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u534713.8% mAP\uff0c\u7d22\u5f15\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53473.33\u500d", "conclusion": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u540e\u671f\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u89c4\u6a21\u9650\u5236\u548c\u7ffb\u8bd1\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898"}}

We propose a method that uses statistical language models as oracles for disambiguation that does not require any hand-annotation of training data.

To address this limitation, we present a comprehensive comparative analysis of two retrieval approaches for multimodal RAG systems, including text-based chunk retrieval (where images are summarized into text before embedding) and direct multimodal embedding retrieval (where images are stored natively in the vector space). We evaluate all three approaches across 6 LLM models and a two multi-modal embedding models on a newly created financial earnings call benchmark comprising 40 question-answer pairs, each paired with 2 documents (1 image and 1 text chunk). Experimental results demonstrate that direct multimodal embedding retrieval significantly outperforms LLM-summary-based approaches, achieving absolute improvements of 13% in mean average precision (mAP@5) and 11% in normalized discounted cumulative gain. These gains correspond to relative improvements of 32% in mAP@5 and 20% in nDCG@5, providing stronger evidence of their practical impact.

Recent work on model compression through pruning and knowledge distillation has reduced this cost; however, this process still incurs hundreds of billions of tokens worth of training cost per compressed model. In this paper, we present Nemotron Elastic, a framework for building reasoning-oriented LLMs, including hybrid Mamba-Attention architectures, that embed multiple nested submodels within a single parent model, each optimized for different deployment configurations and budgets. Each of these submodels shares weights with the parent model and can be extracted zero-shot during deployment without additional training or fine-tuning. We enable this functionality through an end-to-end trained router, tightly coupled to a two-stage training curriculum designed specifically for reasoning models. We additionally introduce group-aware SSM elastification that preserves Mamba's structural constraints, heterogeneous MLP elastification, normalized MSE-based layer importance for improved depth selection, and knowledge distillation enabling simultaneous multi-budget optimization. We apply Nemotron Elastic to the Nemotron Nano V2 12B model, simultaneously producing a 9B and a 6B model using only 110B training tokens; this results in over 360x cost reduction compared to training model families from scratch, and around 7x compared to SoTA compression techniques.

Our framework includes two key components: (1) a game theory-based taxonomy of uncooperative agent behaviors, addressing a notable gap in the existing literature; and (2) a structured, multi-stage simulation pipeline that dynamically generates and refines uncooperative behaviors as agents' states evolve. We evaluate the framework via a collaborative resource management setting, measuring system stability using metrics such as survival time and resource overuse rate. Empirically, our framework achieves 96.7% accuracy in generating realistic uncooperative behaviors, validated by human evaluations. Our results reveal a striking contrast: cooperative agents maintain perfect system stability (100% survival over 12 rounds with 0% resource overuse), while any uncooperative behavior can trigger rapid system collapse within 1 to 7 rounds.

We focus on two core reasoning domains: mathematical reasoning and science/commonsense reasoning, and construct task-specific evaluation leaderboards using both accuracy-based ranking and an Elo-based rating system across five benchmark datasets, enabling consistent model comparison as judges rather than comparators. To improve judgment performance in lightweight models, we propose MAJ (Multi-Agent Judging), a novel multi-agent evaluation framework that leverages multiple interacting SLMs with distinct reasoning profiles to approximate LLM-level judgment accuracy through collaborative deliberation. Experimental results reveal a significant performance gap between SLMs and LLMs in isolated judging tasks. However, our MAJ framework substantially improves the reliability and consistency of SLMs. On the MATH dataset, MAJ using smaller-sized models as backbones performs comparatively well or even better than their larger-sized counterparts. Our findings highlight that multi-agent SLM systems can potentially match or exceed LLM performance in judgment tasks, with implications for scalable and efficient assessment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faJudgeBoard\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u548cMAJ\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b54\u6848\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5224\u65ad\u7b54\u6848\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u65f6\u4f9d\u8d56\u95f4\u63a5\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u9884\u8bbe\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "1. \u6784\u5efaJudgeBoard\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6392\u540d\u548cELO\u8bc4\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\n2. \u8bbe\u8ba1MAJ\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f02\u6784\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u540c\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5224\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027", "result": "MAJ\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5728MATH\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u5982Phi-3-mini\u51c6\u786e\u738777.3% vs GPT-4\u768478.2%\uff09", "conclusion": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u540c\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u7f29\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f"}}

Adversarial queries can successfully elicit these hidden instructions, posing significant security and privacy risks. Existing defense mechanisms frequently rely on heuristics, incur substantial computational overhead, or are inapplicable to models accessed via black-box APIs. This paper introduces a novel framework for hardening system prompts through shield appending, a lightweight approach that adds a protective textual layer to the original prompt. Our core contribution is the formalization of prompt hardening as a utility-constrained optimization problem. We leverage an LLM-as-optimizer to search the space of possible SHIELDs, seeking to minimize a leakage metric derived from a suite of adversarial attacks, while simultaneously preserving task utility above a specified threshold, measured by semantic fidelity to baseline outputs. This black-box, optimization-driven methodology is lightweight and practical, requiring only API access to the target and optimizer LLMs. We demonstrate empirically that our optimized SHIELDs significantly reduce prompt leakage against a comprehensive set of extraction attacks, outperforming established baseline defenses without compromising the model's intended functionality. Our work presents a paradigm for developing robust, utility-aware defenses in the escalating landscape of LLM security.

We establish a comprehensive benchmark evaluating 12 state-of-the-art open- and closed-source MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap: even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to distinguish truth from falsehood reliably.

Existing adaptation algorithms are typically trained iteratively, which incur significant communication costs and increase the susceptibility to potential attacks. Motivated by the one-shot federated training techniques that reduce client-server exchanges to a single round, developing a lightweight one-shot federated VLM adaptation method to alleviate these issues is particularly attractive. However, current one-shot approaches face certain challenges in adapting VLMs within federated settings: (1) insufficient exploitation of the rich multimodal information inherent in VLMs; (2) lack of specialized adaptation strategies to systematically handle the severe data heterogeneity; and (3) requiring additional training resource of clients or server. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel Training-free One-shot Federated Adaptation framework for VLMs, named TOFA. To fully leverage the generalizable multimodal features in pre-trained VLMs, TOFA employs both visual and textual pipelines to extract task-relevant representations. In the visual pipeline, a hierarchical Bayesian model learns personalized, class-specific prototype distributions. For the textual pipeline, TOFA evaluates and globally aligns the generated local text prompts for robustness. An adaptive weight calibration mechanism is also introduced to combine predictions from both modalities, balancing personalization and robustness to handle data heterogeneity. Our method is training-free, not relying on additional training resources on either the client or server side.

While effective, this reductionist paradigm struggles to address the deeper question of what makes a good recommendation, and attempts to broaden evaluation, through user studies or fairness analyses, have had limited impact. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) disrupts this framework: LLMs are generative rather than ranking-based, making standard accuracy metrics questionable. They also introduce challenges such as hallucinations, knowledge cutoffs, non-determinism, and opaque training data, rendering traditional train/test protocols difficult to interpret. At the same time, LLMs create new opportunities, enabling natural-language interaction and even allowing models to act as evaluators.\n  This work argues that the shift toward LLM-driven MRS requires rethinking evaluation. We first review how LLMs reshape user modeling, item modeling, and natural-language recommendation in music.

To resolve this, we propose Prism, a novel decoupled framework that rigorously separates the recommendation process into a dedicated ranking stage and an explanation generation stage.\n  Inspired by knowledge distillation, Prism leverages a powerful teacher LLM (e.g., FLAN-T5-XXL) as an Oracle to produce high-fidelity explanatory knowledge. A compact, fine-tuned student model (e.g., BART-Base), the Prism, then specializes in synthesizing this knowledge into personalized explanations. This decomposition ensures that each component is optimized for its specific objective, eliminating inherent conflicts in coupled models.\n  Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our 140M-parameter Prism model significantly outperforms its 11B-parameter teacher in human evaluations of faithfulness and personalization, while achieving a 24 times speedup and a 10 times reduction in memory consumption during inference.

Processing long videos demands both an efficient model architecture and an effective mechanism for handling extended temporal contexts. To this end, TimeViper adopts a hybrid Mamba-Transformer backbone that combines the efficiency of state-space models with the expressivity of attention mechanisms. Through this hybrid design, we reveal the vision-to-text information aggregation phenomenon, where information progressively flows from vision tokens to text tokens across increasing LLM depth, resulting in severe vision token redundancy. Motivated by this observation, we propose TransV, a token information transfer module that transfers and compresses vision tokens into instruction tokens while maintaining multimodal understanding capabilities. This design enables TimeViper to process hour-long videos exceeding 10,000 frames.

While recent pathology agents have demonstrated explainability in diagnostic tasks, they face three limitations for survival prediction: inability to integrate multimodal data, ineffective region-of-interest exploration, and failure to leverage experiential learning from historical cases. We introduce SurvAgent, the first hierarchical chain-of-thought (CoT)-enhanced multi-agent system for multimodal survival prediction. SurvAgent consists of two stages: (1) WSI-Gene CoT-Enhanced Case Bank Construction employs hierarchical analysis through Low-Magnification Screening, Cross-Modal Similarity-Aware Patch Mining, and Confidence-Aware Patch Mining for pathology images, while Gene-Stratified analysis processes six functional gene categories. Both generate structured reports with CoT reasoning, storing complete analytical processes for experiential learning. (2) Dichotomy-Based Multi-Expert Agent Inference retrieves similar cases via RAG and integrates multimodal reports with expert predictions through progressive interval refinement. Extensive experiments on five TCGA cohorts demonstrate SurvAgent's superority over conventional methods, proprietary MLLMs, and medical agents, establishing a new paradigm for explainable AI-driven survival prediction in precision oncology.", "AI": {"tldr": "SurvAgent\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u764c\u75c7\u751f\u5b58\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728TCGA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u75c5\u7406\u4ee3\u7406\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6574\u5408\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001ROI\u63a2\u7d22\u4f4e\u6548\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5386\u53f2\u6848\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60\u4e09\u5927\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "method": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u67b6\u6784\uff1a1) WSI-Gene CoT\u6848\u4f8b\u5e93\u6784\u5efa\uff08\u75c5\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5c42\u5206\u6790+\u57fa\u56e0\u5206\u5c42\u5206\u6790\uff09\uff1b2) \u57fa\u4e8eRAG\u7684\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u4ee3\u7406\u63a8\u7406\uff08\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u533a\u95f4\u7ec6\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u57285\u4e2aTCGA\u961f\u5217\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u4e13\u6709\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u533b\u7597\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u751f\u5b58\u9884\u6d4b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "SurvAgent\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u548c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u5b58\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u7cbe\u51c6\u80bf\u7624\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

They incorporate textual reasoning, i.e., think, either before (as pre-planning) or after (as post-refinement) the generation process, yet they lack on-the-fly multimodal interaction during the generation itself. In this preliminary study, we introduce Thinking-while-Generating (TwiG), the first interleaved framework that enables co-evolving textual reasoning throughout the visual generation process. As visual content is progressively generating, textual reasoning is interleaved to both guide upcoming local regions and reflect on previously synthesized ones. This dynamic interplay produces more context-aware and semantically rich visual outputs. To unveil the potential of this framework, we investigate three candidate strategies, zero-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our curated TwiG-50K dataset, and reinforcement learning (RL) via a customized TwiG-GRPO strategy, each offering unique insights into the dynamics of interleaved reasoning.
