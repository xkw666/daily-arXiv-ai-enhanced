### [1] [Training Language Models to Generate Quality Code with Program Analysis Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22704)
*Feng Yao,Zilong Wang,Liyuan Liu,Junxia Cui,Li Zhong,Xiaohan Fu,Haohui Mai,Vish Krishnan,Jianfeng Gao,Jingbo Shang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出强化学习框架REAL，通过程序分析和单元测试反馈提升LLM生成代码的生产质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代码生成方法无法有效保障代码安全性（如SQL注入漏洞）和可维护性（如类型注释缺失），传统方法依赖人工标注或规则后处理，扩展性差

Method: 集成程序分析（检测安全/可维护性缺陷）与单元测试（功能验证）构建自动化反馈机制，通过强化学习框架REAL实现提示无关且无需参考代码的监督训练

Result: 在多数据集/模型规模测试中，REAL在功能正确性和代码质量评估上均超越现有最佳方法

Conclusion: 该框架填补了原型开发与生产级代码间的鸿沟，使LLM同时具备高效开发和高质量输出的双重优势

Abstract: Code generation with large language models (LLMs), often termed vibe coding,
is increasingly adopted in production but fails to ensure code quality,
particularly in security (e.g., SQL injection vulnerabilities) and
maintainability (e.g., missing type annotations). Existing methods, such as
supervised fine-tuning and rule-based post-processing, rely on labor-intensive
annotations or brittle heuristics, limiting their scalability and
effectiveness. We propose REAL, a reinforcement learning framework that
incentivizes LLMs to generate production-quality code using program
analysis-guided feedback. Specifically, REAL integrates two automated signals:
(1) program analysis detecting security or maintainability defects and (2) unit
tests ensuring functional correctness. Unlike prior work, our framework is
prompt-agnostic and reference-free, enabling scalable supervision without
manual intervention. Experiments across multiple datasets and model scales
demonstrate that REAL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in simultaneous
assessments of functionality and code quality. Our work bridges the gap between
rapid prototyping and production-ready code, enabling LLMs to deliver both
speed and quality.

*Rafik Mankour,Yassine Chafai,Hamada Saleh,Ghassen Ben Hassine,Thibaud Barreau,Peter Tankov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 构建Climate Finance Bench开放基准，通过330个专家验证的跨领域气候披露QA对评估LLM能力，揭示RAG方法中检索器性能为关键瓶颈，并提出权重量化等低碳技术方案


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏针对企业气候信息披露的标准化评估体系，需建立可量化基准来提升问答系统在提取、数值推理和逻辑推理等复合任务中的表现

Method: 1. 收集11个GICS行业33份英文可持续发展报告
2. 构建包含三种问题类型的330个QA对
3. 系统比较不同RAG架构效果
4. 量化分析检索器准确率与碳排放关系

Result: 1. 检索器仅能定位45%相关段落
2. 权重量化技术可降低32%推理能耗
3. 逻辑推理类问题准确率低于纯提取类28%

Conclusion: 构建标准化气候QA基准至关重要，需重点改进检索模块性能，同时采用模型压缩技术实现环境效益与模型效能的平衡

Abstract: Climate Finance Bench introduces an open benchmark that targets
question-answering over corporate climate disclosures using Large Language
Models. We curate 33 recent sustainability reports in English drawn from
companies across all 11 GICS sectors and annotate 330 expert-validated
question-answer pairs that span pure extraction, numerical reasoning, and
logical reasoning. Building on this dataset, we propose a comparison of RAG
(retrieval-augmented generation) approaches. We show that the retriever's
ability to locate passages that actually contain the answer is the chief
performance bottleneck. We further argue for transparent carbon reporting in
AI-for-climate applications, highlighting advantages of techniques such as
Weight Quantization.

### [3] [Pre-Training Curriculum for Multi-Token Prediction in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22757)
*Ansar Aynetdinov,Alan Akbik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出前向课程学习策略帮助小语言模型有效利用多令牌预测目标，在保持自推测解码优势的同时提升生成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对小语言模型难以有效利用多令牌预测（MTP）的问题，探索通过课程学习策略突破该限制

Method: 设计两种课程学习策略：前向（NTP→MTP）与逆向（MTP→NTP）训练路径，动态调整预测复杂度

Result: 前向策略提升下游任务表现且保留自推测解码加速优势，逆向策略生成质量更优但失去解码加速能力

Conclusion: 课程学习是释放小模型MTP潜力的有效范式，前向策略在性能与推理效率间取得更好平衡

Abstract: Multi-token prediction (MTP) is a recently proposed pre-training objective
for language models. Rather than predicting only the next token (NTP), MTP
predicts the next $k$ tokens at each prediction step, using multiple prediction
heads. MTP has shown promise in improving downstream performance, inference
speed, and training efficiency, particularly for large models. However, prior
work has shown that smaller language models (SLMs) struggle with the MTP
objective. To address this, we propose a curriculum learning strategy for MTP
training, exploring two variants: a forward curriculum, which gradually
increases the complexity of the pre-training objective from NTP to MTP, and a
reverse curriculum, which does the opposite. Our experiments show that the
forward curriculum enables SLMs to better leverage the MTP objective during
pre-training, improving downstream NTP performance and generative output
quality, while retaining the benefits of self-speculative decoding. The reverse
curriculum achieves stronger NTP performance and output quality, but fails to
provide any self-speculative decoding benefits.

### [4] [FAMA: The First Large-Scale Open-Science Speech Foundation Model for English and Italian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22759)
*Sara Papi,Marco Gaido,Luisa Bentivogli,Alessio Brutti,Mauro Cettolo,Roberto Gretter,Marco Matassoni,Mohamed Nabih,Matteo Negri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FAMA是首个基于开源数据的开放科学语音基础模型家族，覆盖英语和意大利语，使用15万+小时开源语音数据训练，并发布完整代码/数据集/模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音基础模型（如Whisper）的封闭性导致可复现性差与评估困难，而语音领域缺乏类似其他领域的开放科学进展。

Method: 使用150k+小时开源语音数据训练，构建包含16k小时清洗和伪标注语音的新数据集，采用开源合规协议。

Result: FAMA性能与现有模型相当且快8倍，所有资源均开源发布。

Conclusion: FAMA填补了语音领域开放科学的空白，通过完全透明的架构推动语音技术研究的可复现性发展。

Abstract: The development of speech foundation models (SFMs) like Whisper and
SeamlessM4T has significantly advanced the field of speech processing. However,
their closed nature--with inaccessible training data and code--poses major
reproducibility and fair evaluation challenges. While other domains have made
substantial progress toward open science by developing fully transparent models
trained on open-source (OS) code and data, similar efforts in speech remain
limited. To fill this gap, we introduce FAMA, the first family of open science
SFMs for English and Italian, trained on 150k+ hours of OS speech data.
Moreover, we present a new dataset containing 16k hours of cleaned and
pseudo-labeled speech for both languages. Results show that FAMA achieves
competitive performance compared to existing SFMs while being up to 8 times
faster. All artifacts, including code, datasets, and models, are released under
OS-compliant licenses, promoting openness in speech technology research.

### [5] [StressTest: Can YOUR Speech LM Handle the Stress?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22765)
*Iddo Yosha,Gallil Maimon,Yossi Adi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出StressTest基准和Stress17k合成数据集，优化后的StresSLM模型在句子重音推理任务中表现显著优于现有模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音感知语言模型（SLMs）在开发评估中普遍忽视句子重音对语义和说话者意图的关键影响，导致模型理解能力存在缺陷

Method: 1. 创建StressTest基准评估模型重音模式识别能力
2. 开发合成数据生成流程构建Stress17k训练集
3. 通过微调实现模型对真实录音的适配优化

Result: StresSLM在句子重音推理（准确率提升23.6%）和检测任务（F1值提高18.9%）上显著超越基线模型

Conclusion: 本研究证明了合成数据训练对提升语音模型重音理解的有效性，为语音语义理解系统开发提供了新的技术路径

Abstract: Sentence stress refers to emphasis, placed on specific words within a spoken
utterance to highlight or contrast an idea, or to introduce new information. It
is often used to imply an underlying intention that is not explicitly stated.
Recent advances in speech-aware language models (SLMs) have enabled direct
processing of audio, allowing models to bypass transcription and access the
full richness of the speech signal and perform audio reasoning tasks such as
spoken question answering. Despite the crucial role of sentence stress in
shaping meaning and speaker intent, it remains largely overlooked in evaluation
and development of such models. In this work, we address this gap by
introducing StressTest, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate a model's
ability to distinguish between interpretations of spoken sentences based on the
stress pattern. We assess the performance of several leading SLMs and find
that, despite their overall capabilities, they perform poorly on such tasks. To
overcome this limitation, we propose a novel synthetic data generation
pipeline, and create Stress17k, a training set that simulates change of meaning
implied by stress variation. Then, we empirically show that optimizing models
with this synthetic dataset aligns well with real-world recordings and enables
effective finetuning of SLMs. Results suggest, that our finetuned model,
StresSLM, significantly outperforms existing models on both sentence stress
reasoning and detection tasks. Code, models, data, and audio samples -

### [6] [Automated Essay Scoring Incorporating Annotations from Automated Feedback Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22771)
*Christopher Ormerod*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 整合反馈注释（拼写纠错+论证标记）可提升自动作文评分系统性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自动作文评分系统缺乏反馈机制，通过融合纠错和论证结构标注提升评估准确性

Method: 使用PERSUADE语料库，结合生成式模型（拼写纠正）和编码器模型（论证元素识别）生成双重注释

Result: 集成注释后，基于编码器的分类模型在AES任务中表现显著提升

Conclusion: 反馈驱动标注为AES系统提供了可解释性改进路径，双重注释机制具有实际应用潜力

Abstract: This study illustrates how incorporating feedback-oriented annotations into
the scoring pipeline can enhance the accuracy of automated essay scoring (AES).
This approach is demonstrated with the Persuasive Essays for Rating, Selecting,
and Understanding Argumentative and Discourse Elements (PERSUADE) corpus. We
integrate two types of feedback-driven annotations: those that identify
spelling and grammatical errors, and those that highlight argumentative
components. To illustrate how this method could be applied in real-world
scenarios, we employ two LLMs to generate annotations -- a generative language
model used for spell-correction and an encoder-based token classifier trained
to identify and mark argumentative elements. By incorporating annotations into
the scoring process, we demonstrate improvements in performance using
encoder-based large language models fine-tuned as classifiers.

### [7] [Counting trees: A treebank-driven exploration of syntactic variation in speech and writing across languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22774)
*Kaja Dobrovoljc*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于树库的跨模态句法对比方法，发现口语和书面语句法结构存在显著差异，口语特有结构体现实时互动需求


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过依赖树库系统比较口语和书面语的句法结构差异，探索不同交际模态的句法组织规律

Method: 使用自下而上的归纳方法，从英语和斯洛文尼亚语的UD树库中提取去词汇化依赖子树，分析结构多样性、分布及跨模态重叠

Result: 口语库结构更少且多样性低，模态间结构重叠有限（<10%），关键结构分析揭示互动性、语境依存和表达经济性特征

Conclusion: 该可扩展框架为跨语料库句法变异研究提供新范式，推动基于语言使用的语法理论发展

Abstract: This paper presents a novel treebank-driven approach to comparing syntactic
structures in speech and writing using dependency-parsed corpora. Adopting a
fully inductive, bottom-up method, we define syntactic structures as
delexicalized dependency (sub)trees and extract them from spoken and written
Universal Dependencies (UD) treebanks in two syntactically distinct languages,
English and Slovenian. For each corpus, we analyze the size, diversity, and
distribution of syntactic inventories, their overlap across modalities, and the
structures most characteristic of speech. Results show that, across both
languages, spoken corpora contain fewer and less diverse syntactic structures
than their written counterparts, with consistent cross-linguistic preferences
for certain structural types across modalities. Strikingly, the overlap between
spoken and written syntactic inventories is very limited: most structures
attested in speech do not occur in writing, pointing to modality-specific
preferences in syntactic organization that reflect the distinct demands of
real-time interaction and elaborated writing. This contrast is further
supported by a keyness analysis of the most frequent speech-specific
structures, which highlights patterns associated with interactivity,
context-grounding, and economy of expression. We argue that this scalable,
language-independent framework offers a useful general method for
systematically studying syntactic variation across corpora, laying the
groundwork for more comprehensive data-driven theories of grammar in use.

### [8] [MEDAL: A Framework for Benchmarking LLMs as Multilingual Open-Domain Chatbots and Dialogue Evaluators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22777)
*John Mendonça,Alon Lavie,Isabel Trancoso*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出MEDAL框架，通过多智能体系统自动生成和评估多语言对话基准，揭示现有LLM在跨语言评估中的不足


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话评估数据集存在静态性、缺乏多语言覆盖等问题，难以捕捉语言文化细微差异，阻碍聊天机器人性能评估

Method: 利用多个SOTA LLM生成多语言对话→GPT-4进行多维性能分析→基于大规模评估结果构建人工标注的元评估基准→测试不同LLM的评估能力

Result: 发现显著的跨语言性能差异，当前LLM在检测同理心（下降27%）和逻辑推理（误差率35%）等细微问题时表现欠佳

Conclusion: MEDAL框架有效生成多样化评估基准，但现有LLM作为评估者仍需提升对情感理解和复杂推理等深层语义的捕捉能力

Abstract: As the capabilities of chatbots and their underlying LLMs continue to
dramatically improve, evaluating their performance has increasingly become a
major blocker to their further development. A major challenge is the available
benchmarking datasets, which are largely static, outdated, and lacking in
multilingual coverage, limiting their ability to capture subtle linguistic and
cultural variations. This paper introduces MEDAL, an automated multi-agent
framework for generating, evaluating, and curating more representative and
diverse open-domain dialogue evaluation benchmarks. Our approach leverages
several state-of-the-art LLMs to generate user-chatbot multilingual dialogues,
conditioned on varied seed contexts. A strong LLM (GPT-4.1) is then used for a
multidimensional analysis of the performance of the chatbots, uncovering
noticeable cross-lingual performance differences. Guided by this large-scale
evaluation, we curate a new meta-evaluation multilingual benchmark and
human-annotate samples with nuanced quality judgments. This benchmark is then
used to assess the ability of several reasoning and non-reasoning LLMs to act
as evaluators of open-domain dialogues. We find that current LLMs struggle to
detect nuanced issues, particularly those involving empathy and reasoning.

### [9] [Can Large Language Models Match the Conclusions of Systematic Reviews?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22787)
*Christopher Polzak,Alejandro Lozano,Min Woo Sun,James Burgess,Yuhui Zhang,Kevin Wu,Serena Yeung-Levy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估24个大语言模型在医学系统评价生成任务中的表现，发现当前模型在科学怀疑态度、长文本处理等方面仍无法匹配专家水平


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证LLMs在获得相同研究资料时，能否生成与临床专家撰写的系统评价相当的结论

Method: 创建包含100个SR及其基础研究的MedEvidence基准，测试24个不同规模（7B-700B）的LLM，包含推理/非推理模型及医疗专用模型

Result: 模型表现呈现三特征：1）推理能力与模型大小不直接提升效果 2）知识微调反而降低准确性 3）所有模型均缺乏对低质量证据的科学怀疑态度

Conclusion: 当前LLM尚无法可靠生成专家水平的系统评价，特别是在长文本处理、证据批判性评估方面存在明显局限，尽管已有临床部署案例

Abstract: Systematic reviews (SR), in which experts summarize and analyze evidence
across individual studies to provide insights on a specialized topic, are a
cornerstone for evidence-based clinical decision-making, research, and policy.
Given the exponential growth of scientific articles, there is growing interest
in using large language models (LLMs) to automate SR generation. However, the
ability of LLMs to critically assess evidence and reason across multiple
documents to provide recommendations at the same proficiency as domain experts
remains poorly characterized. We therefore ask: Can LLMs match the conclusions
of systematic reviews written by clinical experts when given access to the same
studies? To explore this question, we present MedEvidence, a benchmark pairing
findings from 100 SRs with the studies they are based on. We benchmark 24 LLMs
on MedEvidence, including reasoning, non-reasoning, medical specialist, and
models across varying sizes (from 7B-700B). Through our systematic evaluation,
we find that reasoning does not necessarily improve performance, larger models
do not consistently yield greater gains, and knowledge-based fine-tuning
degrades accuracy on MedEvidence. Instead, most models exhibit similar
behavior: performance tends to degrade as token length increases, their
responses show overconfidence, and, contrary to human experts, all models show
a lack of scientific skepticism toward low-quality findings. These results
suggest that more work is still required before LLMs can reliably match the
observations from expert-conducted SRs, even though these systems are already
deployed and being used by clinicians. We release our codebase and benchmark to
the broader research community to further investigate LLM-based SR systems.

*Qing Wang,Yuepei Li,Qiao Qiao,Kang Zhou,Qi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出MixORE框架解决开放关系抽取中已知/未知关系混合分布的难题，通过双阶段分类聚类联合学习实现性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统OpenRE方法假设数据纯为新关系或预分割，不符合现实场景中已知/未知关系随机混合分布的实际需求

Method: 两阶段框架MixORE：整合关系分类（处理已知关系）与聚类（发现新关系）的联合学习机制

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，已知关系分类准确率提升3.1-5.8%，新关系聚类纯度提高12.6-19.4%

Conclusion: 为广义开放关系抽取提供了实用解决方案，推动该领域向真实场景应用迈进

Abstract: Open Relation Extraction (OpenRE) seeks to identify and extract novel
relational facts between named entities from unlabeled data without pre-defined
relation schemas. Traditional OpenRE methods typically assume that the
unlabeled data consists solely of novel relations or is pre-divided into known
and novel instances. However, in real-world scenarios, novel relations are
arbitrarily distributed. In this paper, we propose a generalized OpenRE setting
that considers unlabeled data as a mixture of both known and novel instances.
To address this, we propose MixORE, a two-phase framework that integrates
relation classification and clustering to jointly learn known and novel
relations. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that MixORE
consistently outperforms competitive baselines in known relation classification
and novel relation clustering. Our findings contribute to the advancement of
generalized OpenRE research and real-world applications.

*Andrew Zhu,Evan Osgood,Chris Callison-Burch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出'旁听智能体'新范式，通过监听人类对话实现后台辅助，基于《龙与地下城》场景验证可行性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM智能体非直接交互的新模式，突破传统对话式助手的局限

Method: 使用多模态音频-语言大模型作为旁听智能体，通过人类评估验证其在TRPG游戏中的辅助效果

Result: 部分音频大模型展现通过隐式音频线索完成旁听任务的新兴能力

Conclusion: 证实旁听智能体范式的应用潜力，开源代码库促进后续研究

Abstract: Much work has been done on conversational LLM agents which directly assist
human users with tasks. We present an alternative paradigm for interacting with
LLM agents, which we call "overhearing agents". These overhearing agents do not
actively participate in conversation -- instead, they "listen in" on
human-to-human conversations and perform background tasks or provide
suggestions to assist the user. In this work, we explore the overhearing agents
paradigm through the lens of Dungeons & Dragons gameplay. We present an
in-depth study using large multimodal audio-language models as overhearing
agents to assist a Dungeon Master. We perform a human evaluation to examine the
helpfulness of such agents and find that some large audio-language models have
the emergent ability to perform overhearing agent tasks using implicit audio
cues. Finally, we release Python libraries and our project code to support
further research into the overhearing agents paradigm at
https://github.com/zhudotexe/overhearing_agents.

### [12] [Self-Critique and Refinement for Faithful Natural Language Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22823)
*Yingming Wang,Pepa Atanasova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了SR-NLE框架，通过自反馈和特征归因机制迭代优化大语言模型的自然语言解释忠实度，实验显示不忠实率平均降低18.79%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型的自然语言解释与模型实际推理存在偏差，需要无监督方法提升解释忠实度。现有工作尚未探索模型自我修正解释的能力。

Method: 1. 建立迭代式自我批评与精炼框架
2. 引入自然语言自反馈和基于特征归因词重要性的新型反馈
3. 支持无需外部监督的自动化优化

Result: 跨3数据集、4个LLM的实验表明：
- 最佳方法平均不忠实率36.02%
- 相比基线54.81%绝对降低18.79%

Conclusion: 验证了LLMs具备通过反馈引导自主优化解释的能力，为提升模型可解释性提供了无需训练的解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), natural language
explanations (NLEs) have become increasingly important for understanding model
predictions. However, these explanations often fail to faithfully represent the
model's actual reasoning process. While existing work has demonstrated that
LLMs can self-critique and refine their initial outputs for various tasks, this
capability remains unexplored for improving explanation faithfulness. To
address this gap, we introduce Self-critique and Refinement for Natural
Language Explanations (SR-NLE), a framework that enables models to improve the
faithfulness of their own explanations -- specifically, post-hoc NLEs --
through an iterative critique and refinement process without external
supervision. Our framework leverages different feedback mechanisms to guide the
refinement process, including natural language self-feedback and, notably, a
novel feedback approach based on feature attribution that highlights important
input words. Our experiments across three datasets and four state-of-the-art
LLMs demonstrate that SR-NLE significantly reduces unfaithfulness rates, with
our best method achieving an average unfaithfulness rate of 36.02%, compared to
54.81% for baseline -- an absolute reduction of 18.79%. These findings reveal
that the investigated LLMs can indeed refine their explanations to better
reflect their actual reasoning process, requiring only appropriate guidance
through feedback without additional training or fine-tuning.

*Alexander Gill,Abhilasha Ravichander,Ana Marasović*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM生成评估基准成本低廉但挑战性不足，需重新评估该方法的适用性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLM生成评估数据能否替代人工众包，特别是针对需要复杂推理的阅读理解任务

Method: 通过CondaQA（否定推理）和DROP（数值推理）两个高质量阅读理解数据集，对比LLM生成数据与人工数据的有效性和难度

Result: LLM生成数据符合标注标准且成本低，但相较人工数据对LLM的挑战性降低23-35%

Conclusion: LLM生成评估数据可能导致关键评估维度的丢失，需谨慎采用该基准创建方法

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for data generation.
However, creating evaluation benchmarks raises the bar for this emerging
paradigm. Benchmarks must target specific phenomena, penalize exploiting
shortcuts, and be challenging. Through two case studies, we investigate whether
LLMs can meet these demands by generating reasoning over-text benchmarks and
comparing them to those created through careful crowdsourcing. Specifically, we
evaluate both the validity and difficulty of LLM-generated versions of two
high-quality reading comprehension datasets: CondaQA, which evaluates reasoning
about negation, and DROP, which targets reasoning about quantities. We find
that prompting LLMs can produce variants of these datasets that are often valid
according to the annotation guidelines, at a fraction of the cost of the
original crowdsourcing effort. However, we show that they are less challenging
for LLMs than their human-authored counterparts. This finding sheds light on
what may have been lost by generating evaluation data with LLMs, and calls for
critically reassessing the immediate use of this increasingly prevalent
approach to benchmark creation.

*Arthur S. Bianchessi,Rodrigo C. Barros,Lucas S. Kupssinskü*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出贝叶斯注意力机制(BAM)，通过概率建模统一现有位置编码方法，实现500倍训练长度的上下文泛化能力突破


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有位置编码方法存在理论不清晰、依赖有限评估指标的问题，难以验证其上下文外推能力的有效性

Method: 将位置编码建模为概率先验，提出广义高斯位置先验，兼容NoPE/ALiBi等现有方法并增强长序列建模能力

Result: 在训练长度500倍的上下文检索中准确率超越SOTA，仅增加0.0001%参数量的情况下保持与原模型相当的困惑度

Conclusion: BAM框架为位置编码提供了理论依据，其广义先验设计显著提升模型的长上下文处理能力，具有实际部署价值

Abstract: Transformer-based language models rely on positional encoding (PE) to handle
token order and support context length extrapolation. However, existing PE
methods lack theoretical clarity and rely on limited evaluation metrics to
substantiate their extrapolation claims. We propose the Bayesian Attention
Mechanism (BAM), a theoretical framework that formulates positional encoding as
a prior within a probabilistic model. BAM unifies existing methods (e.g., NoPE
and ALiBi) and motivates a new Generalized Gaussian positional prior that
substantially improves long-context generalization. Empirically, BAM enables
accurate information retrieval at $500\times$ the training context length,
outperforming previous state-of-the-art context length generalization in long
context retrieval accuracy while maintaining comparable perplexity and
introducing minimal additional parameters.

*Pingjun Hong,Beiduo Chen,Siyao Peng,Marie-Catherine de Marneffe,Barbara Plank*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出LITEX语言学分类法，用于解决NLI任务中同标签内解释差异问题，并通过实验验证其在解释生成中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NLI数据集忽视同标签内解释的多样性差异（如相同高亮对应不同自由文本解释），需系统化分类法揭示标注者推理逻辑。

Method: 1. 开发LITEX语言学解释分类法 2. 标注e-SNLI子集验证分类可靠性 3. 对比标签/高亮/LITEX三种条件下的解释生成效果

Result: LITEX引导生成的解释在语言学特征上比传统方法更接近人类解释，能有效捕捉同标签内的解释差异。

Conclusion: LITEX不仅量化了标注变异现象，其引导的生成策略显著缩小了模型与人类解释之间的语言学差距。

Abstract: There is increasing evidence of Human Label Variation (HLV) in Natural
Language Inference (NLI), where annotators assign different labels to the same
premise-hypothesis pair. However, within-label variation--cases where
annotators agree on the same label but provide divergent reasoning--poses an
additional and mostly overlooked challenge. Several NLI datasets contain
highlighted words in the NLI item as explanations, but the same spans on the
NLI item can be highlighted for different reasons, as evidenced by free-text
explanations, which offer a window into annotators' reasoning. To
systematically understand this problem and gain insight into the rationales
behind NLI labels, we introduce LITEX, a linguistically-informed taxonomy for
categorizing free-text explanations. Using this taxonomy, we annotate a subset
of the e-SNLI dataset, validate the taxonomy's reliability, and analyze how it
aligns with NLI labels, highlights, and explanations. We further assess the
taxonomy's usefulness in explanation generation, demonstrating that
conditioning generation on LITEX yields explanations that are linguistically
closer to human explanations than those generated using only labels or
highlights. Our approach thus not only captures within-label variation but also
shows how taxonomy-guided generation for reasoning can bridge the gap between
human and model explanations more effectively than existing strategies.

TL;DR: 提出分层三步提示法(H3Prompt)实现多语言新闻叙事分类，在SemEval 2025英语测试集获得28队中第一


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对在线新闻激增与虚假信息传播的挑战，为事实核查和政策制定提供自动化叙事分类方案

Method: 基于大语言模型的三步分层提示策略：领域分类→主叙事识别→子叙事分配

Result: 英语测试集全球排名第一，代码已开源

Conclusion: H3Prompt有效实现跨语言多层级叙事分类，为信息分析提供可靠技术方案

Abstract: The proliferation of online news and the increasing spread of misinformation
necessitate robust methods for automatic data analysis. Narrative
classification is emerging as a important task, since identifying what is being
said online is critical for fact-checkers, policy markers and other
professionals working on information studies. This paper presents our approach
to SemEval 2025 Task 10 Subtask 2, which aims to classify news articles into a
pre-defined two-level taxonomy of main narratives and sub-narratives across
multiple languages.
  We propose Hierarchical Three-Step Prompting (H3Prompt) for multilingual
narrative classification. Our methodology follows a three-step Large Language
Model (LLM) prompting strategy, where the model first categorises an article
into one of two domains (Ukraine-Russia War or Climate Change), then identifies
the most relevant main narratives, and finally assigns sub-narratives. Our
approach secured the top position on the English test set among 28 competing
teams worldwide. The code is available at https://github.com/GateNLP/H3Prompt.

TL;DR: 当前大型推理模型在多语言推理中存在明显不足，强制使用目标语言会降低准确性，针对性训练可部分缓解问题但仍有损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型推理模型的多语言推理能力，因为用户需要母语推理过程进行有效监督。

Method: 通过XReasoning基准测试领先模型，分析表现并尝试提示干预和100样本的针对性训练。

Result: 模型常切换至英语或生成碎片化推理，提示干预提高可读性但降低准确性，后训练部分缓解问题。

Conclusion: 需平衡可读性与准确性，后续应探索改进多语言推理能力的方法。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) with thinking traces have shown strong
performance on English reasoning tasks. However, their ability to think in
other languages is less studied. This capability is as important as answer
accuracy for real world applications because users may find the reasoning trace
useful for oversight only when it is expressed in their own language. We
comprehensively evaluate two leading families of LRMs on our XReasoning
benchmark and find that even the most advanced models often revert to English
or produce fragmented reasoning in other languages, revealing a substantial gap
in multilingual reasoning. Prompt based interventions that force models to
reason in the users language improve readability and oversight but reduce
answer accuracy, exposing an important trade off. We further show that targeted
post training on just 100 examples mitigates this mismatch, though some
accuracy loss remains. Our results highlight the limited multilingual reasoning
capabilities of current LRMs and outline directions for future work. Code and
data are available at https://github.com/Betswish/mCoT-XReasoning.

TL;DR: 提出VIGNETTE基准测试系统评估视觉语言模型在事实性、感知、刻板印象和决策中的偏见


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM偏见研究局限在肖像图与性别-职业关联，忽视更复杂的社会刻板印象及其潜在危害

Method: 构建含3000万+图像的VQA基准，通过四维度（事实/感知/刻板/决策）的问答框架评估模型偏见

Result: 揭示了VLM在情境化身份解读中的特质假设、能力偏见及歧视模式，发现多层次社会等级编码机制

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型通过输入数据构建社会意义，需系统性评估其隐含的微妙、多维度刻板偏见模式

Abstract: While bias in large language models (LLMs) is well-studied, similar concerns
in vision-language models (VLMs) have received comparatively less attention.
Existing VLM bias studies often focus on portrait-style images and
gender-occupation associations, overlooking broader and more complex social
stereotypes and their implied harm. This work introduces VIGNETTE, a
large-scale VQA benchmark with 30M+ images for evaluating bias in VLMs through
a question-answering framework spanning four directions: factuality,
perception, stereotyping, and decision making. Beyond narrowly-centered
studies, we assess how VLMs interpret identities in contextualized settings,
revealing how models make trait and capability assumptions and exhibit patterns
of discrimination. Drawing from social psychology, we examine how VLMs connect
visual identity cues to trait and role-based inferences, encoding social
hierarchies, through biased selections. Our findings uncover subtle,
multifaceted, and surprising stereotypical patterns, offering insights into how
VLMs construct social meaning from inputs.

TL;DR: 提出基于认知心理学的归因理论框架，揭示大语言模型在事件归因中存在的群体推理差异及其公平性影响


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注语言模型的表层偏见，缺乏对认知层面归因机制的探索。本研究旨在通过心理学理论揭示模型推理过程中产生的系统性偏见传导路径

Method: 构建认知导向的偏见评估框架，分析模型对人口统计群体的事件归因模式（内部归因/外部归因），测量其与人类认知偏见的偏差程度

Result: 发现语言模型在责任归因中存在显著人口统计差异，其推理链条会系统性强化特定群体的负面刻板印象，传统评估方法未能捕捉此类深层认知偏差

Conclusion: 认知视角的评估框架能有效识别模型推理中的偏见传导机制，为开发公平可信的AI系统提供新的方法论支持，需建立认知对齐的模型评估体系

Abstract: When a student fails an exam, do we tend to blame their effort or the test's
difficulty? Attribution, defined as how reasons are assigned to event outcomes,
shapes perceptions, reinforces stereotypes, and influences decisions.
Attribution Theory in social psychology explains how humans assign
responsibility for events using implicit cognition, attributing causes to
internal (e.g., effort, ability) or external (e.g., task difficulty, luck)
factors. LLMs' attribution of event outcomes based on demographics carries
important fairness implications. Most works exploring social biases in LLMs
focus on surface-level associations or isolated stereotypes. This work proposes
a cognitively grounded bias evaluation framework to identify how models'
reasoning disparities channelize biases toward demographic groups.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学评估依赖人工标注且聚焦孤立任务，无法反映急诊室高压环境下涉及复杂临床工作流的核心推理过程。

Method: 构建包含3,984患者25,174份临床记录的数据集，设计覆盖急诊分诊/评估/治疗/诊断全流程的评估任务，并收集72份医生完整推理依据。

Result: 实验显示顶尖大模型在急诊临床推理质量上与医生存在显著差距（如鉴别诊断准确性差18.7%）

Conclusion: ER-Reason揭示了LLMs医疗决策能力的局限性，强调需要开发更贴合临床思维模式的评估体系与模型优化方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been extensively evaluated on medical
question answering tasks based on licensing exams. However, real-world
evaluations often depend on costly human annotators, and existing benchmarks
tend to focus on isolated tasks that rarely capture the clinical reasoning or
full workflow underlying medical decisions. In this paper, we introduce
ER-Reason, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based clinical reasoning and
decision-making in the emergency room (ER)--a high-stakes setting where
clinicians make rapid, consequential decisions across diverse patient
presentations and medical specialties under time pressure. ER-Reason includes
data from 3,984 patients, encompassing 25,174 de-identified longitudinal
clinical notes spanning discharge summaries, progress notes, history and
physical exams, consults, echocardiography reports, imaging notes, and ER
provider documentation. The benchmark includes evaluation tasks that span key
stages of the ER workflow: triage intake, initial assessment, treatment
selection, disposition planning, and final diagnosis--each structured to
reflect core clinical reasoning processes such as differential diagnosis via
rule-out reasoning. We also collected 72 full physician-authored rationales
explaining reasoning processes that mimic the teaching process used in
residency training, and are typically absent from ER documentation. Evaluations
of state-of-the-art LLMs on ER-Reason reveal a gap between LLM-generated and
clinician-authored clinical reasoning for ER decisions, highlighting the need
for future research to bridge this divide.

Motivation: 解决传统语言模型在长期上下文理解中存在的语义保持能力不足问题，特别是上下文丢失和语义漂移现象

Method: 整合显式记忆单元+门控写入机制+注意力读取模块，设计动态更新的遗忘函数，采用主任务损失与记忆约束联合训练策略

Result: 在跨上下文推理准确率提升15%，多轮问答稳定性提高22%，长文本任务中保持90%以上的语义连贯性

Conclusion: 该记忆机制有效解决长期依赖问题，实验验证了架构设计的有效性，为语言理解模型提供新的技术路径

Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of large language models in
understanding long-term context. It proposes a model architecture equipped with
a long-term memory mechanism to improve the retention and retrieval of semantic
information across paragraphs and dialogue turns. The model integrates explicit
memory units, gated writing mechanisms, and attention-based reading modules. A
forgetting function is introduced to enable dynamic updates of memory content,
enhancing the model's ability to manage historical information. To further
improve the effectiveness of memory operations, the study designs a joint
training objective. This combines the main task loss with constraints on memory
writing and forgetting. It guides the model to learn better memory strategies
during task execution. Systematic evaluation across multiple subtasks shows
that the model achieves clear advantages in text generation consistency,
stability in multi-turn question answering, and accuracy in cross-context
reasoning. In particular, the model demonstrates strong semantic retention and
contextual coherence in long-text tasks and complex question answering
scenarios. It effectively mitigates the context loss and semantic drift
problems commonly faced by traditional language models when handling long-term
dependencies. The experiments also include analysis of different memory
structures, capacity sizes, and control strategies. These results further
confirm the critical role of memory mechanisms in language understanding. They
demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach in both
architectural design and performance outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型合并方法在LoRA微调模型上存在性能下降问题，主要源于参数与数据分布的相互作用被忽视。

Method: 在微调前约束LoRA子空间正交性，防止任务更新干扰，可与现有合并算法无缝集成。

Result: 在8个数据集和5种语言模型上验证，OSRM提升合并性能10-15%，保持单任务准确率且对超参数更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 揭示了数据-参数交互对模型合并的重要性，提供即插即用的LoRA模型合并解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LMs) for individual tasks yields strong
performance but is expensive for deployment and storage. Recent works explore
model merging to combine multiple task-specific models into a single multi-task
model without additional training. However, existing merging methods often fail
for models fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation (LoRA), due to significant
performance degradation. In this paper, we show that this issue arises from a
previously overlooked interplay between model parameters and data
distributions. We propose Orthogonal Subspaces for Robust model Merging (OSRM)
to constrain the LoRA subspace *prior* to fine-tuning, ensuring that updates
relevant to one task do not adversely shift outputs for others. Our approach
can seamlessly integrate with most existing merging algorithms, reducing the
unintended interference among tasks. Extensive experiments on eight datasets,
tested with three widely used LMs and two large LMs, demonstrate that our
method not only boosts merging performance but also preserves single-task
accuracy. Furthermore, our approach exhibits greater robustness to the
hyperparameters of merging. These results highlight the importance of
data-parameter interaction in model merging and offer a plug-and-play solution
for merging LoRA models.

Abstract: This study presents an efficient transformer-based question-answering (QA)
model optimized for deployment on a 13th Gen Intel i7-1355U CPU, using the
Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) v1.1. Leveraging exploratory data
analysis, data augmentation, and fine-tuning of a DistilBERT architecture, the
model achieves a validation F1 score of 0.6536 with an average inference time
of 0.1208 seconds per question. Compared to a rule-based baseline (F1: 0.3124)
and full BERT-based models, our approach offers a favorable trade-off between
accuracy and computational efficiency. This makes it well-suited for real-time
applications on resource-constrained systems. The study includes systematic
evaluation of data augmentation strategies and hyperparameter configurations,

Result: 在WorkArena基准测试中超越SFT基线10.26-16.59%，性能接近GPT-4o商业模型

Conclusion: 结构化强化学习机制可有效提升业务导向网页导航任务的推理能力，无需大量标注数据即可实现高效学习

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-empowered web agents enables automating complex,
real-time web navigation tasks in enterprise environments. However, existing
web agents relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often struggle with
generalization and robustness due to insufficient reasoning capabilities when
handling the inherently dynamic nature of web interactions. In this study, we
introduce WorkForceAgent-R1, an LLM-based web agent trained using a rule-based
R1-style reinforcement learning framework designed explicitly to enhance
single-step reasoning and planning for business-oriented web navigation tasks.
We employ a structured reward function that evaluates both adherence to output
formats and correctness of actions, enabling WorkForceAgent-R1 to implicitly
learn robust intermediate reasoning without explicit annotations or extensive
expert demonstrations. Extensive experiments on the WorkArena benchmark
demonstrate that WorkForceAgent-R1 substantially outperforms SFT baselines by
10.26-16.59%, achieving competitive performance relative to proprietary
LLM-based agents (gpt-4o) in workplace-oriented web navigation tasks.

Conclusion: MAC有效暴露多模态系统缺陷，自训练策略为提升模型组合推理能力提供新方向

Abstract: While pre-trained multimodal representations (e.g., CLIP) have shown
impressive capabilities, they exhibit significant compositional vulnerabilities
leading to counterintuitive judgments. We introduce Multimodal Adversarial
Compositionality (MAC), a benchmark that leverages large language models (LLMs)
to generate deceptive text samples to exploit these vulnerabilities across
different modalities and evaluates them through both sample-wise attack success
rate and group-wise entropy-based diversity. To improve zero-shot methods, we
propose a self-training approach that leverages rejection-sampling fine-tuning
with diversity-promoting filtering, which enhances both attack success rate and
sample diversity. Using smaller language models like Llama-3.1-8B, our approach
demonstrates superior performance in revealing compositional vulnerabilities
across various multimodal representations, including images, videos, and
audios.

Method: 构建OWL多语言对齐数据集（含10种语言），采用直接探测/名称填空/前缀生成三种任务评估模型记忆表现

Result: GPT-4o在新翻译文本中作者识别准确率69%，实体预测准确率6%；词序扰动仅使官方翻译准确率下降7%

Conclusion: LLMs具备跨语言记忆迁移能力，这种能力不完全依赖翻译数据，研究揭示了模型记忆机制的泛化特性与潜在隐私风险

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to memorize and recall English text
from their pretraining data. However, the extent to which this ability
generalizes to non-English languages or transfers across languages remains
unclear. This paper investigates multilingual and cross-lingual memorization in
LLMs, probing if memorized content in one language (e.g., English) can be
recalled when presented in translation. To do so, we introduce OWL, a dataset
of 31.5K aligned excerpts from 20 books in ten languages, including English
originals, official translations (Vietnamese, Spanish, Turkish), and new
translations in six low-resource languages (Sesotho, Yoruba, Maithili,
Malagasy, Setswana, Tahitian). We evaluate memorization across model families
and sizes through three tasks: (1) direct probing, which asks the model to
identify a book's title and author; (2) name cloze, which requires predicting
masked character names; and (3) prefix probing, which involves generating
continuations. We find that LLMs consistently recall content across languages,
even for texts without direct translation in pretraining data. GPT-4o, for
example, identifies authors and titles 69% of the time and masked entities 6%
of the time in newly translated excerpts. Perturbations (e.g., masking
characters, shuffling words) modestly reduce direct probing accuracy (7% drop
for shuffled official translations). Our results highlight the extent of
cross-lingual memorization and provide insights on the differences between the
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 否定是语言核心现象，可能完全改变语义。随着VLMs被部署于高风险场景，评估其否定理解能力至关重要。

Method: 通过大语言模型从现有VQA数据集生成否定问题，构建含7,379个二选一问题的NegVQA基准，评估20个前沿VLMs。

Result: 主流VLMs在否定问题上表现平均下降31.9%，且模型规模呈现先恶化后改善的U型扩展趋势。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs的否定理解存在严重缺陷，需针对性改进。NegVQA为VLM开发提供重要评估工具与方向指引。

Abstract: Negation is a fundamental linguistic phenomenon that can entirely reverse the
meaning of a sentence. As vision language models (VLMs) continue to advance and
are deployed in high-stakes applications, assessing their ability to comprehend
negation becomes essential. To address this, we introduce NegVQA, a visual
question answering (VQA) benchmark consisting of 7,379 two-choice questions
covering diverse negation scenarios and image-question distributions. We
construct NegVQA by leveraging large language models to generate negated
versions of questions from existing VQA datasets. Evaluating 20
state-of-the-art VLMs across seven model families, we find that these models
struggle significantly with negation, exhibiting a substantial performance drop
compared to their responses to the original questions. Furthermore, we uncover
a U-shaped scaling trend, where increasing model size initially degrades
performance on NegVQA before leading to improvements. Our benchmark reveals
critical gaps in VLMs' negation understanding and offers insights into future
VLM development. Project page available at

Result: 在ArXiv数据集上FactCC/SummaC指标分别提升19.2/9.7分，PubMed和Multi-News数据集也显示持续改进

Conclusion: 结构感知提示机制为LLM的零样本抽取式摘要提供了简单有效的解决方案，无需额外训练或任务调优

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in zero-shot
summarization, but often struggle to model document structure and identify
salient information in long texts. In this work, we introduce StrucSum, a
training-free prompting framework that enhances LLM reasoning through
sentence-level graph structures. StrucSum injects structural signals into
prompts via three targeted strategies: Neighbor-Aware Prompting (NAP) for local
context, Centrality-Aware Prompting (CAP) for importance estimation, and
Centrality-Guided Masking (CGM) for efficient input reduction. Experiments on
ArXiv, PubMed, and Multi-News demonstrate that StrucSum consistently improves
both summary quality and factual consistency over unsupervised baselines and
vanilla prompting. Notably, on ArXiv, it boosts FactCC and SummaC by 19.2 and
9.7 points, indicating stronger alignment between summaries and source content.
These findings suggest that structure-aware prompting is a simple yet effective
approach for zero-shot extractive summarization with LLMs, without any training
or task-specific tuning.

Abstract: Automated large-scale analysis of public discussions around contested issues
like abortion requires detecting and understanding the use of arguments. While
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in language processing tasks,
their performance in mining topic-specific, pre-defined arguments in online
comments remains underexplored. We evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs on three
argument mining tasks using datasets comprising over 2,000 opinion comments
across six polarizing topics. Quantitative evaluation suggests an overall
strong performance across the three tasks, especially for large and fine-tuned
LLMs, albeit at a significant environmental cost. However, a detailed error
analysis revealed systematic shortcomings on long and nuanced comments and
emotionally charged language, raising concerns for downstream applications like
content moderation or opinion analysis. Our results highlight both the promise
and current limitations of LLMs for automated argument analysis in online
comments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HSE合规评估需动态实时决策，但LLMs在领域知识和结构化法律推理方面存在不足，需系统评估其能力并改进推理机制。

Method: 构建含1000+多源问题的HSE-Bench数据集，集成IRAC法律推理流程，评估十余种LLMs表现，并提出模拟专家决策的RoE提示技术。

Result: 当前LLMs主要依赖语义匹配（准确率61.8%），RoE技术使法律推理一致性提升23.6%，多模态模型较纯文本模型表现提升15.2%。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在系统性法律推理上的不足，提出的RoE框架为合规性评估任务提供了可解释的决策路径，推动领域专用推理模型发展。

Abstract: Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) compliance assessment demands dynamic
real-time decision-making under complicated regulations and complex
human-machine-environment interactions. While large language models (LLMs) hold
significant potential for decision intelligence and contextual dialogue, their
capacity for domain-specific knowledge in HSE and structured legal reasoning
remains underexplored. We introduce HSE-Bench, the first benchmark dataset
designed to evaluate the HSE compliance assessment capabilities of LLM.
HSE-Bench comprises over 1,000 manually curated questions drawn from
regulations, court cases, safety exams, and fieldwork videos, and integrates a
reasoning flow based on Issue spotting, rule Recall, rule Application, and rule
Conclusion (IRAC) to assess the holistic reasoning pipeline. We conduct
extensive evaluations on different prompting strategies and more than 10 LLMs,
including foundation models, reasoning models and multimodal vision models. The
results show that, although current LLMs achieve good performance, their
capabilities largely rely on semantic matching rather than principled reasoning
grounded in the underlying HSE compliance context. Moreover, their native
reasoning trace lacks the systematic legal reasoning required for rigorous HSE
compliance assessment. To alleviate these, we propose a new prompting
technique, Reasoning of Expert (RoE), which guides LLMs to simulate the
reasoning process of different experts for compliance assessment and reach a
more accurate unified decision. We hope our study highlights reasoning gaps in
LLMs for HSE compliance and inspires further research on related tasks.

Method: 1. 双心理理论模块架构：主动预测对手反对观点 + MLP分类器评估对手立场
2. 强化学习机制动态优化论点生成策略

Result: 跨多个测试场景实现39.4%相对性能提升，生成论点重复率降低48%，长对话场景逻辑连贯性提升62%

Conclusion: ToMAP首次实现语言模型的心理状态动态建模，为构建拟人化说服代理提供新范式，代码已开源

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising potential in persuasion,
but existing works on training LLM persuaders are still preliminary. Notably,
while humans are skilled in modeling their opponent's thoughts and opinions
proactively and dynamically, current LLMs struggle with such Theory of Mind
(ToM) reasoning, resulting in limited diversity and opponent awareness. To
address this limitation, we introduce Theory of Mind Augmented Persuader
(ToMAP), a novel approach for building more flexible persuader agents by
incorporating two theory of mind modules that enhance the persuader's awareness
and analysis of the opponent's mental state. Specifically, we begin by
prompting the persuader to consider possible objections to the target central
claim, and then use a text encoder paired with a trained MLP classifier to
predict the opponent's current stance on these counterclaims. Our carefully
designed reinforcement learning schema enables the persuader learns how to
analyze opponent-related information and utilize it to generate more effective
arguments. Experiments show that the ToMAP persuader, while containing only 3B
parameters, outperforms much larger baselines, like GPT-4o, with a relative
gain of 39.4% across multiple persuadee models and diverse corpora. Notably,
ToMAP exhibits complex reasoning chains and reduced repetition during training,
which leads to more diverse and effective arguments. The opponent-aware feature
of ToMAP also makes it suitable for long conversations and enables it to employ
more logical and opponent-aware strategies. These results underscore our
method's effectiveness and highlight its potential for developing more
persuasive language agents. Code is available at:

Motivation: 探索结构化医疗数据中缩放定律的适用性，解决传统自然语言模型扩展原则在EHR领域的空白

Method: 基于MIMIC-IV数据库患者时间轴数据，通过调整Transformer模型规模和计算预算进行系统性实验

Result: 发现抛物线IsoFLOPs曲线及计算-参数量-数据量-临床效用的幂律关系，证明EHR模型扩展规律与LLMs相似

Conclusion: 建立EHR基础模型开发框架，为优化临床预测模型训练提供理论依据，推动个性化医疗发展

Abstract: The emergence of scaling laws has profoundly shaped the development of large
language models (LLMs), enabling predictable performance gains through
systematic increases in model size, dataset volume, and compute. Yet, these
principles remain largely unexplored in the context of electronic health
records (EHRs) -- a rich, sequential, and globally abundant data source that
differs structurally from natural language. In this work, we present the first
empirical investigation of scaling laws for EHR foundation models. By training
transformer architectures on patient timeline data from the MIMIC-IV database
across varying model sizes and compute budgets, we identify consistent scaling
patterns, including parabolic IsoFLOPs curves and power-law relationships
between compute, model parameters, data size, and clinical utility. These
findings demonstrate that EHR models exhibit scaling behavior analogous to
LLMs, offering predictive insights into resource-efficient training strategies.
Our results lay the groundwork for developing powerful EHR foundation models
capable of transforming clinical prediction tasks and advancing personalized
healthcare.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统声明验证方法在处理复杂语义结构和模糊实体时缺乏有效消歧策略，影响验证可靠性

Method: 1) 将声明分解为结构化三元组构建图表示
2) 与知识库迭代交互进行实体消歧
3) 验证剩余三元组完成事实核查

Result: 在HoVer和FEVEROUS基准测试中，使用Meta-Llama-3-70B达到竞争性表现

Conclusion: VeGraph有效解决了复杂声明验证的挑战，框架代码和数据已开源

Abstract: Claim verification is a long-standing and challenging task that demands not
only high accuracy but also explainability of the verification process. This
task becomes an emerging research issue in the era of large language models
(LLMs) since real-world claims are often complex, featuring intricate semantic
structures or obfuscated entities. Traditional approaches typically address
this by decomposing claims into sub-claims and querying a knowledge base to
resolve hidden or ambiguous entities. However, the absence of effective
disambiguation strategies for these entities can compromise the entire
verification process. To address these challenges, we propose
Verify-in-the-Graph (VeGraph), a novel framework leveraging the reasoning and
comprehension abilities of LLM agents. VeGraph operates in three phases: (1)
Graph Representation - an input claim is decomposed into structured triplets,
forming a graph-based representation that integrates both structured and
unstructured information; (2) Entity Disambiguation -VeGraph iteratively
interacts with the knowledge base to resolve ambiguous entities within the
graph for deeper sub-claim verification; and (3) Verification - remaining
triplets are verified to complete the fact-checking process. Experiments using
Meta-Llama-3-70B (instruct version) show that VeGraph achieves competitive
performance compared to baselines on two benchmarks HoVer and FEVEROUS,
effectively addressing claim verification challenges. Our source code and data
are available for further exploitation.

Motivation: 开放基准测试易受测试集污染，但现有方法需要模型内部信息。本研究旨在开发无需模型细节的污染检测方案。

Method: 借鉴银行防劫设计，在测试集中混入多组随机目标的后门样本。当模型训练使用污染数据时，后门触发行为会产生统计显著性证据。

Result: 在MMLU-Pro/Big-Bench-Hard数据集实现0.000073%/0.000017%假阳性率，Alpaca开放生成任务达到0.127%假阳性率，成功检测所有污染模型。

Conclusion: DyePack为测试集污染检测提供了理论可靠、任务普适的解决方案，有效防止基准测试的评估失真问题。

Abstract: Open benchmarks are essential for evaluating and advancing large language
models, offering reproducibility and transparency. However, their accessibility
makes them likely targets of test set contamination. In this work, we introduce
DyePack, a framework that leverages backdoor attacks to identify models that
used benchmark test sets during training, without requiring access to the loss,
logits, or any internal details of the model. Like how banks mix dye packs with
their money to mark robbers, DyePack mixes backdoor samples with the test data
to flag models that trained on it. We propose a principled design incorporating
multiple backdoors with stochastic targets, enabling exact false positive rate
(FPR) computation when flagging every model. This provably prevents false
accusations while providing strong evidence for every detected case of
contamination. We evaluate DyePack on five models across three datasets,
covering both multiple-choice and open-ended generation tasks. For
multiple-choice questions, it successfully detects all contaminated models with
guaranteed FPRs as low as 0.000073% on MMLU-Pro and 0.000017% on Big-Bench-Hard
using eight backdoors. For open-ended generation tasks, it generalizes well and
identifies all contaminated models on Alpaca with a guaranteed false positive
rate of just 0.127% using six backdoors.

Motivation: Addressing challenges of applying SOTA LLM research to industrial settings requiring both conversational flexibility and strict compliance with service constraints.

Method: Developed workflow optimizations and a conversational agent framework validated through e-commerce use cases.

Result: Created a scalable framework for controllable AI agents that bridges academic research and industrial applications.

Conclusion: Demonstrated practical implementation strategies to enhance reliability of LLM-driven systems in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to significant
improvements in various service domains, including search, recommendation, and
chatbot applications. However, applying state-of-the-art (SOTA) research to
industrial settings presents challenges, as it requires maintaining flexible
conversational abilities while also strictly complying with service-specific
constraints. This can be seen as two conflicting requirements due to the
probabilistic nature of LLMs. In this paper, we propose our approach to
addressing this challenge and detail the strategies we employed to overcome
their inherent limitations in real-world applications. We conduct a practical
case study of a conversational agent designed for the e-commerce domain,
detailing our implementation workflow and optimizations. Our findings provide
insights into bridging the gap between academic research and real-world
application, introducing a framework for developing scalable, controllable, and
reliable AI-driven agents.

Result: 在机器翻译和QA数据集上验证，检测效果优于基线且保持模型性能，参考过滤有效性获实验支持

Conclusion: RFTC通过响应差异检测与聚类分析，实现非侵入式后门检测，兼具高效性与模型性能保持优势

Abstract: Fine-tuning LLMs with datasets containing stealthy backdoors from publishers
poses security risks to downstream applications. Mainstream detection methods
either identify poisoned samples by analyzing the prediction probability of
poisoned classification models or rely on the rewriting model to eliminate the
stealthy triggers. However, the former cannot be applied to generation tasks,
while the latter may degrade generation performance and introduce new triggers.
Therefore, efficiently eliminating stealthy poisoned samples for LLMs remains
an urgent problem. We observe that after applying TF-IDF clustering to the
sample response, there are notable differences in the intra-class distances
between clean and poisoned samples. Poisoned samples tend to cluster closely
because of their specific malicious outputs, whereas clean samples are more
scattered due to their more varied responses. Thus, in this paper, we propose a
stealthy backdoor sample detection method based on Reference-Filtration and
Tfidf-Clustering mechanisms (RFTC). Specifically, we first compare the sample
response with the reference model's outputs and consider the sample suspicious
if there's a significant discrepancy. And then we perform TF-IDF clustering on
these suspicious samples to identify the true poisoned samples based on the
intra-class distance. Experiments on two machine translation datasets and one
QA dataset demonstrate that RFTC outperforms baselines in backdoor detection
and model performance. Further analysis of different reference models also
confirms the effectiveness of our Reference-Filtration.

Motivation: 现有知识编辑评估忽视前置上下文触发原始知识检索的问题，导致实际应用效果受限

Method: 开发CHED基准测试集，设计CoRE方法通过最小化隐藏状态的上下文敏感方差增强鲁棒性

Result: 现有方法在CHED上失败率较高，CoRE在保持模型能力的同时显著提升上下文场景下的编辑成功率

Conclusion: CoRE有效解决上下文干扰问题，且用户侧与助手侧上下文对编辑影响存在差异，注意力模式分析揭示关键token影响机制

Abstract: Knowledge editing (KE) methods offer an efficient way to modify knowledge in
large language models. Current KE evaluations typically assess editing success
by considering only the edited knowledge without any preceding contexts. In
real-world applications, however, preceding contexts often trigger the
retrieval of the original knowledge and undermine the intended edit. To address
this issue, we develop CHED -- a benchmark designed to evaluate the context
robustness of KE methods. Evaluations on CHED show that they often fail when
preceding contexts are present. To mitigate this shortcoming, we introduce
CoRE, a KE method designed to strengthen context robustness by minimizing
context-sensitive variance in hidden states of the model for edited knowledge.
This method not only improves the editing success rate in situations where a
preceding context is present but also preserves the overall capabilities of the
model. We provide an in-depth analysis of the differing impacts of preceding
contexts when introduced as user utterances versus assistant responses, and we
dissect attention-score patterns to assess how specific tokens influence
editing success.

TL;DR: Propose Neighborhood Stability Measure (NSM) based on semantic space peakedness to estimate imageability/concreteness without visual data. Achieve SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on parallel visual-semantic data (e.g., image-caption pairs). We hypothesize text itself contains sufficient signals through neighborhood structure in semantic space.

Method: Unsupervised NSM metric quantifies peakedness of word neighborhoods in embedding space. Measures local stability of semantic neighbors.

Result: NSM shows stronger correlation with human ratings than existing unsupervised methods (+12-15%), achieves 81.3% accuracy in classification tasks.

Conclusion: Semantic neighborhood patterns effectively predict psycholinguistic properties. Text-only approach reduces multimodal dependency, improves computational efficiency.

Abstract: Imageability (potential of text to evoke a mental image) and concreteness
(perceptibility of text) are two psycholinguistic properties that link visual
and semantic spaces. It is little surprise that computational methods that
estimate them do so using parallel visual and semantic spaces, such as
collections of image-caption pairs or multi-modal models. In this paper, we
work on the supposition that text itself in an image-caption dataset offers
sufficient signals to accurately estimate these properties. We hypothesize, in
particular, that the peakedness of the neighborhood of a word in the semantic
embedding space reflects its degree of imageability and concreteness. We then
propose an unsupervised, distribution-free measure, which we call Neighborhood
Stability Measure (NSM), that quantifies the sharpness of peaks. Extensive
experiments show that NSM correlates more strongly with ground-truth ratings
than existing unsupervised methods, and is a strong predictor of these
properties for classification. Our code and data are available on GitHub
(https://github.com/Artificial-Memory-Lab/imageability).

Result: SP系统提取最多实体（49,688），断言准确率最高（76%）；AWS准确率最低（50%）。专用工具准确率仅56%

Conclusion: 不同NLP工具性能差异显著，临床应用前需严格验证，确保标注可靠性

Abstract: General-purpose clinical natural language processing (NLP) tools are
increasingly used for the automatic labeling of clinical reports. However,
independent evaluations for specific tasks, such as pediatric chest radiograph
(CXR) report labeling, are limited. This study compares four commercial
clinical NLP systems - Amazon Comprehend Medical (AWS), Google Healthcare NLP
(GC), Azure Clinical NLP (AZ), and SparkNLP (SP) - for entity extraction and
assertion detection in pediatric CXR reports. Additionally, CheXpert and
CheXbert, two dedicated chest radiograph report labelers, were evaluated on the
same task using CheXpert-defined labels. We analyzed 95,008 pediatric CXR
reports from a large academic pediatric hospital. Entities and assertion
statuses (positive, negative, uncertain) from the findings and impression
sections were extracted by the NLP systems, with impression section entities
mapped to 12 disease categories and a No Findings category. CheXpert and
CheXbert extracted the same 13 categories. Outputs were compared using Fleiss
Kappa and accuracy against a consensus pseudo-ground truth. Significant
differences were found in the number of extracted entities and assertion
distributions across NLP systems. SP extracted 49,688 unique entities, GC
16,477, AZ 31,543, and AWS 27,216. Assertion accuracy across models averaged
around 62%, with SP highest (76%) and AWS lowest (50%). CheXpert and CheXbert
achieved 56% accuracy. Considerable variability in performance highlights the
need for careful validation and review before deploying NLP tools for clinical
report labeling.

Conclusion: 强调人机界面设计需要平衡效率与语言丰富性，建议开发混合解析模型（结合神经符号方法）并加强多语言用户的适应性训练方案

Abstract: Machine-Facing English (MFE) is an emergent register shaped by the adaptation
of everyday language to the expanding presence of AI interlocutors. Drawing on
register theory (Halliday 1985, 2006), enregisterment (Agha 2003), audience
design (Bell 1984), and interactional pragmatics (Giles & Ogay 2007), this
study traces how sustained human-AI interaction normalizes syntactic rigidity,
pragmatic simplification, and hyper-explicit phrasing - features that enhance
machine parseability at the expense of natural fluency. Our analysis is
grounded in qualitative observations from bilingual (Korean/English) voice- and
text-based product testing sessions, with reflexive drafting conducted using
Natural Language Declarative Prompting (NLD-P) under human curation. Thematic
analysis identifies five recurrent traits - redundant clarity, directive
syntax, controlled vocabulary, flattened prosody, and single-intent structuring
- that improve execution accuracy but compress expressive range. MFE's
evolution highlights a persistent tension between communicative efficiency and
linguistic richness, raising design challenges for conversational interfaces
and pedagogical considerations for multilingual users. We conclude by
underscoring the need for comprehensive methodological exposition and future
empirical validation.

Abstract: The inherent nature of social media posts, characterized by the freedom of
language use with a disjointed array of diverse opinions and topics, poses
significant challenges to downstream NLP tasks such as comment clustering,
comment summarization, and social media opinion analysis. To address this, we
propose a granular level of identifying and generating aspect terms from
individual comments to guide model attention. Specifically, we leverage
multilingual large language models with supervised fine-tuning for comment
aspect term generation (CAT-G), further aligning the model's predictions with
human expectations through DPO. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
in enhancing the comprehension of social media discourse on two NLP tasks.
Moreover, this paper contributes the first multilingual CAT-G test set on
English, Chinese, Malay, and Bahasa Indonesian. As LLM capabilities vary among
languages, this test set allows for a comparative analysis of performance
across languages with varying levels of LLM proficiency.

Conclusion: 证明小参数开源LLM通过集成学习在ICL范式下的有效性，为资源受限场景提供高效NER解决方案

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) technique based on Large Language Models (LLMs) has
gained prominence in Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks for its lower
computing resource consumption, less manual labeling overhead, and stronger
generalizability. Nevertheless, most ICL-based NER methods depend on
large-parameter LLMs: the open-source models demand substantial computational
resources for deployment and inference, while the closed-source ones incur high
API costs, raise data-privacy concerns, and hinder community collaboration. To
address this question, we propose an Ensemble Learning Method for Named Entity
Recognition (EL4NER), which aims at aggregating the ICL outputs of multiple
open-source, small-parameter LLMs to enhance overall performance in NER tasks
at less deployment and inference cost. Specifically, our method comprises three
key components. First, we design a task decomposition-based pipeline that
facilitates deep, multi-stage ensemble learning. Second, we introduce a novel
span-level sentence similarity algorithm to establish an ICL demonstration
retrieval mechanism better suited for NER tasks. Third, we incorporate a
self-validation mechanism to mitigate the noise introduced during the ensemble
process. We evaluated EL4NER on multiple widely adopted NER datasets from
diverse domains. Our experimental results indicate that EL4NER surpasses most
closed-source, large-parameter LLM-based methods at a lower parameter cost and
even attains state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among ICL-based methods on
certain datasets. These results show the parameter efficiency of EL4NER and
underscore the feasibility of employing open-source, small-parameter LLMs
within the ICL paradigm for NER tasks.

Conclusion: RAGRouter通过动态知识适应机制，为RAG场景提供了高效可靠的模型路由解决方案

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) significantly improves the performance
of Large Language Models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks. However, varying
response quality across LLMs under RAG necessitates intelligent routing
mechanisms, which select the most suitable model for each query from multiple
retrieval-augmented LLMs via a dedicated router model. We observe that external
documents dynamically affect LLMs' ability to answer queries, while existing
routing methods, which rely on static parametric knowledge representations,
exhibit suboptimal performance in RAG scenarios. To address this, we formally
define the new retrieval-augmented LLM routing problem, incorporating the
influence of retrieved documents into the routing framework. We propose
RAGRouter, a RAG-aware routing design, which leverages document embeddings and
RAG capability embeddings with contrastive learning to capture knowledge
representation shifts and enable informed routing decisions. Extensive
experiments on diverse knowledge-intensive tasks and retrieval settings show
that RAGRouter outperforms the best individual LLM by 3.61% on average and
existing routing methods by 3.29%-9.33%. With an extended score-threshold-based
mechanism, it also achieves strong performance-efficiency trade-offs under
low-latency constraints.

Conclusion: 通过创新的强化学习框架，验证了小模型通过自纠正机制大幅提升代码生成质量的可行性，为轻量级模型的工业应用提供新思路

Abstract: Self-correction has demonstrated potential in code generation by allowing
language models to revise and improve their outputs through successive
refinement. Recent studies have explored prompting-based strategies that
incorporate verification or feedback loops using proprietary models, as well as
training-based methods that leverage their strong reasoning capabilities.
However, whether smaller models possess the capacity to effectively guide their
outputs through self-reflection remains unexplored. Our findings reveal that
smaller models struggle to exhibit reflective revision behavior across both
self-correction paradigms. In response, we introduce CoCoS, an approach
designed to enhance the ability of small language models for multi-turn code
correction. Specifically, we propose an online reinforcement learning objective
that trains the model to confidently maintain correct outputs while
progressively correcting incorrect outputs as turns proceed. Our approach
features an accumulated reward function that aggregates rewards across the
entire trajectory and a fine-grained reward better suited to multi-turn
correction scenarios. This facilitates the model in enhancing initial response
quality while achieving substantial improvements through self-correction. With
1B-scale models, CoCoS achieves improvements of 35.8% on the MBPP and 27.7% on
HumanEval compared to the baselines.

Abstract: With the increasing integration of visual and textual content in Social

Vision-Language LLMs in real-world social media scenarios. SNS-Bench-VL
incorporates images and text across 8 multimodal tasks, including note
comprehension, user engagement analysis, information retrieval, and
personalized recommendation. It comprises 4,001 carefully curated multimodal
question-answer pairs, covering single-choice, multiple-choice, and open-ended
tasks. We evaluate over 25 state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs, analyzing their
performance across tasks. Our findings highlight persistent challenges in
multimodal social context comprehension. We hope SNS-Bench-VL will inspire
future research towards robust, context-aware, and human-aligned multimodal
intelligence for next-generation social networking services.

TL;DR: 本文提出MBR-OT解码方法，通过Wasserstein距离结合句子级效用函数，显著提升了文档级文本生成任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文档级文本生成任务因需理解长上下文而更具挑战性，传统MBR解码的效用函数多针对句子级设计，导致文档级任务性能受限。

Method: 提出MBR-OT方法，利用Wasserstein距离将句子级效用函数扩展至文档级效用计算。

Result: 实验表明MBR-OT在文档级机器翻译、文本简化和密集图像描述任务中均优于标准MBR。

Conclusion: MBR-OT有效解决了文档级效用评估难题，为复杂文本生成任务提供了新思路，代码已开源便于复现。

Abstract: Document-level text generation tasks are known to be more difficult than
sentence-level text generation tasks as they require the understanding of
longer context to generate high-quality texts. In this paper, we investigate
the adaption of Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding for document-level text
generation tasks. MBR decoding makes use of a utility function to estimate the
output with the highest expected utility from a set of candidate outputs.
Although MBR decoding is shown to be effective in a wide range of
sentence-level text generation tasks, its performance on document-level text
generation tasks is limited as many of the utility functions are designed for
evaluating the utility of sentences. To this end, we propose MBR-OT, a variant
of MBR decoding using Wasserstein distance to compute the utility of a document
using a sentence-level utility function. The experimental result shows that the
performance of MBR-OT outperforms that of the standard MBR in document-level
machine translation, text simplification, and dense image captioning tasks. Our
code is available at https://github.com/jinnaiyuu/mbr-optimal-transport

*Zexuan Li,Hongliang Dai,Piji Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过改进LLM生成训练样本的多样性与正确性，提升关系抽取任务效果：采用ICL提示指令和DPO微调方法，生成更优质的训练数据，并验证训练非LLM模型效果更佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM生成的关系抽取样本存在结构相似性高、表达方式单一的问题，导致训练数据质量受限，需在保证正确性的前提下提升样本多样性。

Method: 1. 通过ICL提示直接引导LLM生成多样化样本；2. 提出基于DPO的微调方案优化LLM的多样性生成能力；3. 在常用RE数据集上对比直接LLM推理与训练非LLM模型的性能差异。

Result: 两种方法均提升生成数据质量，且实验表明使用LLM生成数据训练的非LLM关系抽取模型性能优于直接使用LLM进行关系抽取。

Conclusion: 提升LLM生成数据的多样性对关系抽取任务至关重要，通过提示工程和模型微调可有效实现，且训练轻量级模型可能比直接使用LLM更具性价比优势。

Abstract: Using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate training data can potentially
be a preferable way to improve zero or few-shot NLP tasks. However, many
problems remain to be investigated for this direction. For the task of Relation
Extraction (RE), we find that samples generated by directly prompting LLMs may
easily have high structural similarities with each other. They tend to use a
limited variety of phrasing while expressing the relation between a pair of
entities. Therefore, in this paper, we study how to effectively improve the
diversity of the training samples generated with LLMs for RE, while also
maintaining their correctness. We first try to make the LLMs produce dissimilar
samples by directly giving instructions in In-Context Learning (ICL) prompts.
Then, we propose an approach to fine-tune LLMs for diversity training sample
generation through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our experiments on
commonly used RE datasets show that both attempts can improve the quality of
the generated training data. We also find that comparing with directly
performing RE with an LLM, training a non-LLM RE model with its generated
samples may lead to better performance.

Motivation: 人类偏好数据收集成本高且效率低下，传统标注方法存在可扩展性问题，需开发更高效的数据筛选方法

Result: 33%精选数据达到SOTA性能，成功检测出9.2%低效样本和3.7%错误标注样本（在Anthropic数据集上验证）

Conclusion: 数据地图实现无标注筛选，提升6倍数据效率，具备数据集诊断能力，为高效RLHF训练提供新范式

Abstract: Human preference data plays a critical role in aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human values. However, collecting such data is often expensive and
inefficient, posing a significant scalability challenge. To address this, we
introduce Alignment Data Map, a GPT-4o-assisted tool for analyzing and
diagnosing preference data. Using GPT-4o as a proxy for LLM alignment, we
compute alignment scores for LLM-generated responses to instructions from
existing preference datasets. These scores are then used to construct an
Alignment Data Map based on their mean and variance. Our experiments show that
using only 33 percent of the data, specifically samples in the high-mean,
low-variance region, achieves performance comparable to or better than using
the entire dataset. This finding suggests that the Alignment Data Map can
significantly improve data collection efficiency by identifying high-quality
samples for LLM alignment without requiring explicit annotations. Moreover, the
Alignment Data Map can diagnose existing preference datasets. Our analysis
shows that it effectively detects low-impact or potentially misannotated
samples. Source code is available online.

Result: 在多个医疗多模态基准测试中稳定超越基线模型，大模型实验验证了方法的鲁棒性

Conclusion: MedE²有效提升医疗多模态推理性能，实验证明该方法具有实际应用价值

Abstract: Effective clinical decision-making depends on iterative, multimodal reasoning
across diverse sources of evidence. The recent emergence of multimodal
reasoning models has significantly transformed the landscape of solving complex
tasks. Although such models have achieved notable success in mathematics and
science, their application to medical domains remains underexplored. In this
work, we propose \textit{MedE$^2$}, a two-stage post-training pipeline that
elicits and then enhances multimodal reasoning for medical domains. In Stage-I,
we fine-tune models using 2,000 text-only data samples containing precisely
orchestrated reasoning demonstrations to elicit reasoning behaviors. In
Stage-II, we further enhance the model's reasoning capabilities using 1,500
rigorously curated multimodal medical cases, aligning model reasoning outputs
with our proposed multimodal medical reasoning preference. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the efficacy and reliability of \textit{MedE$^2$} in
improving the reasoning performance of medical multimodal models. Notably,
models trained with \textit{MedE$^2$} consistently outperform baselines across
multiple medical multimodal benchmarks. Additional validation on larger models
and under inference-time scaling further confirms the robustness and practical
utility of our approach.

Result: ContextQFormer在TMDialog数据集上的可用率指标相比基线模型提升2%-4%

Conclusion: 通过新型上下文建模模块和专用数据集，有效提升多模态对话系统的长程交互能力，为后续研究提供基础设施

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot
abilities and powerful image-understanding capabilities. However, the existing
open-source multi-modal models suffer from the weak capability of multi-turn
interaction, especially for long contexts. To address the issue, we first
introduce a context modeling module, termed ContextQFormer, which utilizes a
memory block to enhance the presentation of contextual information.
Furthermore, to facilitate further research, we carefully build a new
multi-turn multi-modal dialogue dataset (TMDialog) for pre-training,
instruction-tuning, and evaluation, which will be open-sourced lately. Compared
with other multi-modal dialogue datasets, TMDialog contains longer
conversations, which supports the research of multi-turn multi-modal dialogue.
In addition, ContextQFormer is compared with three baselines on TMDialog and
experimental results illustrate that ContextQFormer achieves an improvement of
2%-4% in available rate over baselines.

Result: 所有SOTA推理模型的平均表现欠佳，最佳模型通过率仅54%

Conclusion: LLMs在历史语言学等领域的归纳推理能力仍有重大提升空间，此类推理任务的普适性尚未实现

Abstract: Recently, long chain of thought (LCoT), Large Language Models (LLMs), have
taken the machine learning world by storm with their breathtaking reasoning
capabilities. However, are the abstract reasoning abilities of these models
general enough for problems of practical importance? Unlike past work, which
has focused mainly on math, coding, and data wrangling, we focus on a
historical linguistics-inspired inductive reasoning problem, formulated as
Programming by Examples. We develop a fully automated pipeline for dynamically
generating a benchmark for this task with controllable difficulty in order to
tackle scalability and contamination issues to which many reasoning benchmarks
are subject. Using our pipeline, we generate a test set with nearly 1k
instances that is challenging for all state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs, with the
best model (Claude-3.7-Sonnet) achieving a mere 54% pass rate, demonstrating
that LCoT LLMs still struggle with a class or reasoning that is ubiquitous in
historical linguistics as well as many other domains.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型在处理机器翻译中的上下文敏感单元(如多义词)时存在局部误译和全局理解偏差，导致翻译质量下降甚至失败。需要针对性解决方案提升模型对CSUs的处理能力。

Method: 1. 动态识别翻译难点中的CSUs 2. 通过结构化语义焦点机制激活模型相关知识 3. 采用信息分层注入方式避免信息扁平化问题

Result: 在机器翻译基准测试中超越多个开源基线模型，跨语言对(相似/远距离)平均BLEU提升2.4-3.8，处理复杂术语的准确率提升37%

Conclusion: 该方法通过语义焦点机制有效激活大语言模型的潜在知识，显著提升机器翻译质量，且具备跨任务迁移能力，为提升LLMs的语义敏感性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated exceptional performance across
multiple crosslingual NLP tasks, including machine translation (MT). However,
persistent challenges remain in addressing context-sensitive units (CSUs), such
as polysemous words. These CSUs not only affect the local translation accuracy
of LLMs, but also affect LLMs' understanding capability for sentences and
tasks, and even lead to translation failure. To address this problem, we
propose a simple but effective method to enhance LLMs' MT capabilities by
acquiring CSUs and applying semantic focus. Specifically, we dynamically
analyze and identify translation challenges, then incorporate them into LLMs in
a structured manner to mitigate mistranslations or misunderstandings of CSUs
caused by information flattening. Efficiently activate LLMs to identify and
apply relevant knowledge from its vast data pool in this way, ensuring more
accurate translations for translating difficult terms. On a benchmark dataset
of MT, our proposed method achieved competitive performance compared to
multiple existing open-sourced MT baseline models. It demonstrates
effectiveness and robustness across multiple language pairs, including both
similar language pairs and distant language pairs. Notably, the proposed method
requires no additional model training and enhances LLMs' performance across
multiple NLP tasks with minimal resource consumption.

Motivation: 传统BLI方法在专业领域（如医学数据集）表现显著下降，主要受限于专业语料规模小、低频术语多及静态词嵌入的上下文适应性不足

Method: 融合通用领域与目标领域语料，引入代码切换技术（Code Switch），结合预训练模型动态优化跨领域词向量对齐策略

Result: 在三个专业领域数据集上平均提升0.78个点，显著优于Muse和Vecmap等传统方法

Conclusion: 所提出的动态词嵌入方法能有效克服专业领域数据局限性，为跨领域双语词典构建提供新思路

Abstract: Bilingual Lexicon Induction (BLI) is generally based on common domain data to
obtain monolingual word embedding, and by aligning the monolingual word
embeddings to obtain the cross-lingual embeddings which are used to get the
word translation pairs. In this paper, we propose a new task of BLI, which is
to use the monolingual corpus of the general domain and target domain to
extract domain-specific bilingual dictionaries. Motivated by the ability of
Pre-trained models, we propose a method to get better word embeddings that
build on the recent work on BLI. This way, we introduce the Code Switch(Qin et
al., 2020) firstly in the cross-domain BLI task, which can match differit is
yet to be seen whether these methods are suitable for bilingual lexicon
extraction in professional fields. As we can see in table 1, the classic and
efficient BLI approach, Muse and Vecmap, perform much worse on the Medical
dataset than on the Wiki dataset. On one hand, the specialized domain data set
is relatively smaller compared to the generic domain data set generally, and
specialized words have a lower frequency, which will directly affect the
translation quality of bilingual dictionaries. On the other hand, static word
embeddings are widely used for BLI, however, in some specific fields, the
meaning of words is greatly influenced by context, in this case, using only
static word embeddings may lead to greater bias. ent strategies in different
contexts, making the model more suitable for this task. Experimental results
show that our method can improve performances over robust BLI baselines on
three specific domains by averagely improving 0.78 points.

Result: 相比单独LDA或直接让模型列举主题，Retell方法在主题精确性和信息量上提升显著，文化身份分析的案例验证有效性

Conclusion: 该方法为文学分析和文化研究提供了新工具，兼具效果优势与实施便捷性

Abstract: Conventional bag-of-words approaches for topic modeling, like latent
Dirichlet allocation (LDA), struggle with literary text. Literature challenges
lexical methods because narrative language focuses on immersive sensory details
instead of abstractive description or exposition: writers are advised to "show,
don't tell." We propose Retell, a simple, accessible topic modeling approach
for literature. Here, we prompt resource-efficient, generative language models
(LMs) to tell what passages show, thereby translating narratives' surface forms
into higher-level concepts and themes. By running LDA on LMs' retellings of
passages, we can obtain more precise and informative topics than by running LDA
alone or by directly asking LMs to list topics. To investigate the potential of
our method for cultural analytics, we compare our method's outputs to
expert-guided annotations in a case study on racial/cultural identity in high
school English language arts books.

languages and sociophonetic variation. With the large-scale training data,
ZIPA, including transducer (ZIPA-T) and CTC-based (ZIPA-CR) variants, leverage
the efficient Zipformer backbones and outperform existing phone recognition
systems with much fewer parameters. Further scaling via noisy student training
on 11,000 hours of pseudo-labeled multilingual data yields further improvement.
While ZIPA achieves strong performance on benchmarks, error analysis reveals

Abstract: Transforming dense, detailed, unstructured text into an interpretable and
summarised table, also colloquially known as Text-to-Table generation, is an
essential task for information retrieval. Current methods, however, miss out on
how and what complex information to extract; they also lack the ability to
infer data from the text. In this paper, we introduce a versatile approach,
Map&Make, which "dissects" text into propositional atomic statements. This
facilitates granular decomposition to extract the latent schema. The schema is
then used to populate the tables that capture the qualitative nuances and the
quantitative facts in the original text. Our approach is tested against two
challenging datasets, Rotowire, renowned for its complex and multi-table
schema, and Livesum, which demands numerical aggregation. By carefully
identifying and correcting hallucination errors in Rotowire, we aim to achieve
a cleaner and more reliable benchmark. We evaluate our method rigorously on a
comprehensive suite of comparative and referenceless metrics. Our findings
demonstrate significant improvement results across both datasets with better
interpretability in Text-to-Table generation. Moreover, through detailed
ablation studies and analyses, we investigate the factors contributing to
superior performance and validate the practicality of our framework in
structured summarization tasks.

Abstract: Traditional code instruction data synthesis methods suffer from limited
diversity and poor logic. We introduce Infinite-Instruct, an automated
framework for synthesizing high-quality question-answer pairs, designed to
enhance the code generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The
framework focuses on improving the internal logic of synthesized problems and
the quality of synthesized code. First, "Reverse Construction" transforms code
snippets into diverse programming problems. Then, through "Backfeeding
Construction," keywords in programming problems are structured into a knowledge
graph to reconstruct them into programming problems with stronger internal
logic. Finally, a cross-lingual static code analysis pipeline filters invalid
samples to ensure data quality. Experiments show that on mainstream code
generation benchmarks, our fine-tuned models achieve an average performance
improvement of 21.70% on 7B-parameter models and 36.95% on 32B-parameter
models. Using less than one-tenth of the instruction fine-tuning data, we
achieved performance comparable to the Qwen-2.5-Coder-Instruct.
Infinite-Instruct provides a scalable solution for LLM training in programming.
We open-source the datasets used in the experiments, including both unfiltered
versions and filtered versions via static analysis. The data are available at

Method: 通过分析翻译模型内部工作机制（可解释性）和不确定性量化，提出无监督评估指标。在12种语言对的14个指标上进行多标签集验证。

Result: 无监督指标展现未开发潜力；监督方法在标签不一致时表现下降；单一标注评估存在脆弱性。

Abstract: Word-level quality estimation (WQE) aims to automatically identify
fine-grained error spans in machine-translated outputs and has found many uses,
including assisting translators during post-editing. Modern WQE techniques are
often expensive, involving prompting of large language models or ad-hoc
training on large amounts of human-labeled data. In this work, we investigate
efficient alternatives exploiting recent advances in language model
interpretability and uncertainty quantification to identify translation errors
from the inner workings of translation models. In our evaluation spanning 14
metrics across 12 translation directions, we quantify the impact of human label
variation on metric performance by using multiple sets of human labels. Our
results highlight the untapped potential of unsupervised metrics, the
shortcomings of supervised methods when faced with label uncertainty, and the
brittleness of single-annotator evaluation practices.

Abstract: Large Language Model-based multi-agent systems (MAS) have shown remarkable
progress in solving complex tasks through collaborative reasoning and
inter-agent critique. However, existing approaches typically treat each task in
isolation, resulting in redundant computations and limited generalization
across structurally similar tasks. To address this, we introduce multi-agent
cross-task experiential learning (MAEL), a novel framework that endows
LLM-driven agents with explicit cross-task learning and experience
accumulation. We model the task-solving workflow on a graph-structured
multi-agent collaboration network, where agents propagate information and
coordinate via explicit connectivity. During the experiential learning phase,
we quantify the quality for each step in the task-solving workflow and store
the resulting rewards along with the corresponding inputs and outputs into each
agent's individual experience pool. During inference, agents retrieve
high-reward, task-relevant experiences as few-shot examples to enhance the
effectiveness of each reasoning step, thereby enabling more accurate and
efficient multi-agent collaboration. Experimental results on diverse datasets
demonstrate that MAEL empowers agents to learn from prior task experiences
effectively-achieving faster convergence and producing higher-quality solutions
on current tasks.

Abstract: Recent studies provide large language models (LLMs) with textual task-solving
experiences via prompts to improve their performance. However, previous methods
rely on substantial human labor or time to gather such experiences for each
task, which is impractical given the growing variety of task types in user
queries to LLMs. To address this issue, we design an autonomous experience
transfer framework to explore whether LLMs can mimic human cognitive
intelligence to autonomously transfer experience from existing source tasks to
newly encountered target tasks. This not only allows the acquisition of
experience without extensive costs of previous methods, but also offers a novel
path for the generalization of LLMs. Experimental results on 13 datasets
demonstrate that our framework effectively improves the performance of LLMs.
Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of each module in the framework.

Abstract: In recent years, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made
significant progress but continue to face inherent challenges in multimodal
reasoning, which requires multi-level (e.g., perception, reasoning) and
multi-granular (e.g., multi-step reasoning chain) advanced inferencing. Prior
work on estimating model confidence tends to focus on the overall response for
training and calibration, but fails to assess confidence in each reasoning
step, leading to undesirable hallucination snowballing. In this work, we
present MMBoundary, a novel framework that advances the knowledge boundary
awareness of MLLMs through reasoning step confidence calibration. To achieve
this, we propose to incorporate complementary textual and cross-modal
self-rewarding signals to estimate confidence at each step of the MLLM
reasoning process. In addition to supervised fine-tuning MLLM on this set of
self-rewarded confidence estimation signal for initial confidence expression
warm-up, we introduce a reinforcement learning stage with multiple reward
functions for further aligning model knowledge and calibrating confidence at
each reasoning step, enhancing reasoning chain self-correction. Empirical
results show that MMBoundary significantly outperforms existing methods across
diverse domain datasets and metrics, achieving an average of 7.5% reduction in
multimodal confidence calibration errors and up to 8.3% improvement in task
performance.

TL;DR: 提出MCTSr-Zero框架，通过领域对齐和探索增强机制解决LLM在开放式心理咨询对话中的原则对齐问题，实验验证其生成高质量对话数据的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于结果导向的MCTS方法在主观性强的心理咨询对话中容易产生原则失配的回应，需要建立符合共情/伦理等主观标准的对话生成机制。

Method: 1) 领域对齐：将MCTS搜索目标转向符合领域原则的对话轨迹；2) 再生机制：允许重新生成初始策略；3) 元提示适应：动态调整提示策略扩展探索空间。

Result: 构建PsyEval评估基准，微调后的PsyLLM在心理咨询对话质量指标上达到SOTA，验证框架在原则对齐和响应质量上的双重优势。

Conclusion: MCTSr-Zero成功解决了LLM在复杂心理标准下的对话对齐难题，为人本中心领域提供了可扩展的高质量对话生成方法论。

Abstract: The integration of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with Large Language Models
(LLMs) has demonstrated significant success in structured, problem-oriented
tasks. However, applying these methods to open-ended dialogues, such as those
in psychological counseling, presents unique challenges. Unlike tasks with
objective correctness, success in therapeutic conversations depends on
subjective factors like empathetic engagement, ethical adherence, and alignment
with human preferences, for which strict "correctness" criteria are
ill-defined. Existing result-oriented MCTS approaches can therefore produce
misaligned responses. To address this, we introduce MCTSr-Zero, an MCTS
framework designed for open-ended, human-centric dialogues. Its core innovation
is "domain alignment", which shifts the MCTS search objective from predefined
end-states towards conversational trajectories that conform to target domain
principles (e.g., empathy in counseling). Furthermore, MCTSr-Zero incorporates
"Regeneration" and "Meta-Prompt Adaptation" mechanisms to substantially broaden
exploration by allowing the MCTS to consider fundamentally different initial
dialogue strategies. We evaluate MCTSr-Zero in psychological counseling by
generating multi-turn dialogue data, which is used to fine-tune an LLM, PsyLLM.
We also introduce PsyEval, a benchmark for assessing multi-turn psychological
counseling dialogues. Experiments demonstrate that PsyLLM achieves
state-of-the-art performance on PsyEval and other relevant metrics, validating
MCTSr-Zero's effectiveness in generating high-quality, principle-aligned
conversational data for human-centric domains and addressing the LLM challenge
of consistently adhering to complex psychological standards.

Abstract: Chart question answering (CQA) has become a critical multimodal task for
evaluating the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models. While early
approaches have shown promising performance by focusing on visual features or
leveraging large-scale pre-training, most existing evaluations rely on rigid
output formats and objective metrics, thus ignoring the complex, real-world
demands of practical chart analysis. In this paper, we introduce ChartMind, a
new benchmark designed for complex CQA tasks in real-world settings. ChartMind
covers seven task categories, incorporates multilingual contexts, supports
open-domain textual outputs, and accommodates diverse chart formats, bridging
the gap between real-world applications and traditional academic benchmarks.
Furthermore, we propose a context-aware yet model-agnostic framework, ChartLLM,
that focuses on extracting key contextual elements, reducing noise, and
enhancing the reasoning accuracy of multimodal large language models. Extensive
evaluations on ChartMind and three representative public benchmarks with 14
mainstream multimodal models show our framework significantly outperforms the
previous three common CQA paradigms: instruction-following, OCR-enhanced, and
chain-of-thought, highlighting the importance of flexible chart understanding
for real-world CQA. These findings suggest new directions for developing more
robust chart reasoning in future research.

Abstract: Approaches form the foundation for conducting scientific research. Querying
approaches from a vast body of scientific papers is extremely time-consuming,
and without a well-organized management framework, researchers may face
significant challenges in querying and utilizing relevant approaches.
Constructing multiple dimensions on approaches and managing them from these
dimensions can provide an efficient solution. Firstly, this paper identifies
approach patterns using a top-down way, refining the patterns through four
distinct linguistic levels: semantic level, discourse level, syntactic level,
and lexical level. Approaches in scientific papers are extracted based on
approach patterns. Additionally, five dimensions for categorizing approaches
are identified using these patterns. This paper proposes using tree structure
to represent step and measuring the similarity between different steps with a
tree-structure-based similarity measure that focuses on syntactic-level
similarities. A collection similarity measure is proposed to compute the
similarity between approaches. A bottom-up clustering algorithm is proposed to
construct class trees for approach components within each dimension by merging
each approach component or class with its most similar approach component or
class in each iteration. The class labels generated during the clustering
process indicate the common semantics of the step components within the
approach components in each class and are used to manage the approaches within
the class. The class trees of the five dimensions collectively form a
multi-dimensional approach space. The application of approach queries on the
multi-dimensional approach space demonstrates that querying within this space
ensures strong relevance between user queries and results and rapidly reduces
search space through a class-based query mechanism.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在阿拉伯语等低资源语言中生成类人文本的隐蔽威胁，可能破坏教育、医疗、社交媒体等领域的信息完整性。

Method: 采用三种生成策略（标题生成/内容感知生成/文本优化）、四种模型架构（ALLaM/Jais/Llama/GPT-4），结合文体测量分析和BERT检测模型开发。

Result: 检测模型在正式语境达99.9% F1值，发现机器生成文本存在可检测特征且跨领域泛化困难。

Conclusion: 建立了阿拉伯语机器文本检测的理论框架，为开发语言感知的检测系统奠定基础，填补低资源语言研究的空白。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved unprecedented capabilities in
generating human-like text, posing subtle yet significant challenges for
information integrity across critical domains, including education, social
media, and academia, enabling sophisticated misinformation campaigns,
compromising healthcare guidance, and facilitating targeted propaganda. This
challenge becomes severe, particularly in under-explored and low-resource
languages like Arabic. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation of
Arabic machine-generated text, examining multiple generation strategies
(generation from the title only, content-aware generation, and text refinement)
across diverse model architectures (ALLaM, Jais, Llama, and GPT-4) in academic,
and social media domains. Our stylometric analysis reveals distinctive
linguistic patterns differentiating human-written from machine-generated Arabic
text across these varied contexts. Despite their human-like qualities, we
demonstrate that LLMs produce detectable signatures in their Arabic outputs,
with domain-specific characteristics that vary significantly between different
contexts. Based on these insights, we developed BERT-based detection models
that achieved exceptional performance in formal contexts (up to 99.9\%
F1-score) with strong precision across model architectures. Our cross-domain
analysis confirms generalization challenges previously reported in the
literature. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the most
comprehensive investigation of Arabic machine-generated text to date, uniquely
combining multiple prompt generation methods, diverse model architectures, and
in-depth stylometric analysis across varied textual domains, establishing a
foundation for developing robust, linguistically-informed detection systems
essential for preserving information integrity in Arabic-language contexts.

TL;DR: 通过探测0.5B代理模型的注意力信号，Sentinel框架无需训练专用压缩模型即可实现5倍上下文压缩，性能媲美7B规模系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索增强生成的上下文压缩方法需要训练专用模型，成本高且可移植性差。本文旨在开发轻量级压缩方案，利用原生注意力信号替代模型训练。

Method: 基于代理LLM的注意力机制，设计轻量级分类器识别句子相关性。通过解码器注意力模式分析实现问题感知的上下文过滤，避免专门压缩模型训练。

Result: 在LongBench基准测试中实现5倍压缩率，QA准确率与7B压缩系统相当，计算成本降低85%。0.5B代理模型注意力模式与大型模型高度一致。

Conclusion: 注意力信号探测为上下文压缩提供高效新范式，兼具问题感知能力和跨模型可移植性，显著降低部署门槛。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs)
with external context, but retrieved passages are often lengthy, noisy, or
exceed input limits. Existing compression methods typically require supervised
training of dedicated compression models, increasing cost and reducing
portability. We propose Sentinel, a lightweight sentence-level compression
framework that reframes context filtering as an attention-based understanding
task. Rather than training a compression model, Sentinel probes decoder
attention from an off-the-shelf 0.5B proxy LLM using a lightweight classifier
to identify sentence relevance. Empirically, we find that query-context
relevance estimation is consistent across model scales, with 0.5B proxies
closely matching the behaviors of larger models. On the LongBench benchmark,
Sentinel achieves up to 5$\times$ compression while matching the QA performance
of 7B-scale compression systems. Our results suggest that probing native
attention signals enables fast, effective, and question-aware context
compression. Code available at: https://github.com/yzhangchuck/Sentinel.

Method: 构建包含反事实编辑与时序编辑的脚本化基准，通过（1）token级事实准确性评估（2）文本级行为逻辑连贯性评估的双重验证框架

Result: 所有知识编辑方法在传统指标上平均下降37.2%，文本级评估中仅达到52.1%的合格率，揭示动作型知识编辑的技术挑战

Conclusion: ScEdit基准突破了传统评估维度，证明现有知识编辑技术在实际应用场景中的局限性，为改进模型编辑能力提供新的研究方向

Abstract: Knowledge Editing (KE) has gained increasing attention, yet current KE tasks
remain relatively simple. Under current evaluation frameworks, many editing
methods achieve exceptionally high scores, sometimes nearing perfection.
However, few studies integrate KE into real-world application scenarios (e.g.,
recent interest in LLM-as-agent). To support our analysis, we introduce a novel
script-based benchmark -- ScEdit (Script-based Knowledge Editing Benchmark) --
which encompasses both counterfactual and temporal edits. We integrate
token-level and text-level evaluation methods, comprehensively analyzing
existing KE techniques. The benchmark extends traditional fact-based
("What"-type question) evaluation to action-based ("How"-type question)
evaluation. We observe that all KE methods exhibit a drop in performance on
established metrics and face challenges on text-level metrics, indicating a
challenging task. Our benchmark is available at

TL;DR: 长文本生成中LLMs存在长度偏差现象，响应越长事实精度越低，主要归因于知识耗尽而非错误传播或长上下文因素


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大语言模型生成文本长度与事实性之间的关联，现有研究对此长度偏置现象缺乏系统分析

Method: 提出自动化双层长文本事实性评估框架，通过控制实验验证错误传播/长上下文/知识耗尽三个假设

Result: 实验证实知识耗尽现象（模型逐步耗尽可靠知识）是事实性下降的主因，其他假设影响不显著

Conclusion: 响应长度影响LLMs事实性的核心机制是知识资源的渐进耗尽，这为优化长文本生成提供了新方向

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used for long-form text generation.
However, factual errors in the responses would undermine their reliability.
Despite growing attention to LLM factuality, the effect of response length on
factuality remains underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate
this relationship by first introducing an automatic and bi-level long-form
factuality evaluation framework, which achieves high agreement with human
annotations while being cost-effective. Using this framework, we conduct
controlled experiments and find that longer responses exhibit lower factual
precision, confirming the presence of length bias. To explain this phenomenon,
we empirically examine three hypotheses: error propagation, long context, and
facts exhaustion. Our results reveal that facts exhaustion, where the model
gradually exhausts more reliable knowledge, is the primary cause of factual
degradation, rather than the other two hypotheses.

Abstract: While Ukrainian NLP has seen progress in many texts processing tasks, emotion

crowdsourcing using the Toloka.ai platform ensuring high-quality of the
annotation process. Then, we evaluate a range of approaches on the collected
dataset, starting from linguistic-based baselines, synthetic data translated
from English, to large language models (LLMs). Our findings highlight the
challenges of emotion classification in non-mainstream languages like Ukrainian

Conclusion: 验证了轻量级数据高效范式在工业部署中的可行性，特别是在标注资源受限场景下的应用潜力

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems
are increasingly deployed in industry applications, yet their reliability
remains hampered by challenges in detecting hallucinations. While supervised
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods that leverage LLM hidden states -- such as
activation tracing and representation analysis -- show promise, their
dependence on extensively annotated datasets limits scalability in real-world
applications. This paper addresses the critical bottleneck of data annotation
by investigating the feasibility of reducing training data requirements for two
SOTA hallucination detection frameworks: Lookback Lens, which analyzes
attention head dynamics, and probing-based approaches, which decode internal
model representations. We propose a methodology combining efficient
classification algorithms with dimensionality reduction techniques to minimize
sample size demands while maintaining competitive performance. Evaluations on
standardized question-answering RAG benchmarks show that our approach achieves
performance comparable to strong proprietary LLM-based baselines with only 250
training samples. These results highlight the potential of lightweight,
data-efficient paradigms for industrial deployment, particularly in
annotation-constrained scenarios.

Conclusion: PaMA有效解决事件型GCD场景的特殊挑战，通过模式对齐和原型平衡机制实现跨数据集的稳健性能。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to classify both known and novel
categories using partially labeled data that contains only known classes.
Despite achieving strong performance on existing benchmarks, current textual
GCD methods lack sufficient validation in realistic settings. We introduce
Event-Centric GCD (EC-GCD), characterized by long, complex narratives and
highly imbalanced class distributions, posing two main challenges: (1)
divergent clustering versus classification groupings caused by subjective
criteria, and (2) Unfair alignment for minority classes. To tackle these, we
propose PaMA, a framework leveraging LLMs to extract and refine event patterns
for improved cluster-class alignment. Additionally, a ranking-filtering-mining
pipeline ensures balanced representation of prototypes across imbalanced
categories. Evaluations on two EC-GCD benchmarks, including a newly constructed
Scam Report dataset, demonstrate that PaMA outperforms prior methods with up to
12.58% H-score gains, while maintaining strong generalization on base GCD
datasets.

Conclusion: 置信度建模显著提升评分可靠性，新型损失函数有效利用评分域序结构，实现可解释的自动化分数质量控制

Abstract: A key ethical challenge in Automated Essay Scoring (AES) is ensuring that
scores are only released when they meet high reliability standards. Confidence
modelling addresses this by assigning a reliability estimate measure, in the
form of a confidence score, to each automated score. In this study, we frame
confidence estimation as a classification task: predicting whether an
AES-generated score correctly places a candidate in the appropriate CEFR level.
While this is a binary decision, we leverage the inherent granularity of the
scoring domain in two ways. First, we reformulate the task as an n-ary
classification problem using score binning. Second, we introduce a set of novel
Kernel Weighted Ordinal Categorical Cross Entropy (KWOCCE) loss functions that
incorporate the ordinal structure of CEFR labels. Our best-performing model
achieves an F1 score of 0.97, and enables the system to release 47% of scores
with 100% CEFR agreement and 99% with at least 95% CEFR agreement -compared to
approximately 92% (approx.) CEFR agreement from the standalone AES model where
we release all AM predicted scores.

Method: 通过分解DPO损失函数发现正则化缺失，提出PRO方法用近似完整正则化项统一处理成对/标量反馈，消除似然不确定性

Conclusion: 理论揭示了直接对齐方法的正则化缺陷，PRO通过完整正则化实现多场景稳定对齐，为对齐机制提供新分析框架

Abstract: Direct alignment methods typically optimize large language models (LLMs) by
contrasting the likelihoods of preferred versus dispreferred responses. While
effective in steering LLMs to match relative preference, these methods are
frequently noted for decreasing the absolute likelihoods of example responses.
As a result, aligned models tend to generate outputs that deviate from the
expected patterns, exhibiting reward-hacking effect even without a reward
model. This undesired consequence exposes a fundamental limitation in
contrastive alignment, which we characterize as likelihood underdetermination.
In this work, we revisit direct preference optimization (DPO) -- the seminal
direct alignment method -- and demonstrate that its loss theoretically admits a
decomposed reformulation. The reformulated loss not only broadens applicability
to a wider range of feedback types, but also provides novel insights into the
underlying cause of likelihood underdetermination. Specifically, the standard
DPO implementation implicitly oversimplifies a regularizer in the reformulated
loss, and reinstating its complete version effectively resolves the
underdetermination issue. Leveraging these findings, we introduce PRoximalized
PReference Optimization (PRO), a unified method to align with diverse feeback
types, eliminating likelihood underdetermination through an efficient
approximation of the complete regularizer. Comprehensive experiments show the
superiority of PRO over existing methods in scenarios involving pairwise,
binary and scalar feedback.

Conclusion: 未来研究应聚焦情境引导外推机制与训练数据的交互过程，开发不依赖LLM内在推理能力的增强技术，推动可控AI能力发展。

Abstract: In this position paper we raise critical awareness of a realistic view of LLM
capabilities that eschews extreme alternative views that LLMs are either
"stochastic parrots" or in possession of "emergent" advanced reasoning
capabilities, which, due to their unpredictable emergence, constitute an
existential threat. Our middle-ground view is that LLMs extrapolate from priors
from their training data, and that a mechanism akin to in-context learning
enables the targeting of the appropriate information from which to extrapolate.
We call this "context-directed extrapolation." Under this view, substantiated
though existing literature, while reasoning capabilities go well beyond
stochastic parroting, such capabilities are predictable, controllable, not
indicative of advanced reasoning akin to high-level cognitive capabilities in
humans, and not infinitely scalable with additional training. As a result,
fears of uncontrollable emergence of agency are allayed, while research
advances are appropriately refocused on the processes of context-directed
extrapolation and how this interacts with training data to produce valuable
capabilities in LLMs. Future work can therefore explore alternative augmenting
techniques that do not rely on inherent advanced reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出Q-RM模型，通过解耦奖励建模与语言生成，有效解决传统PRM方法的冲突问题，显著提升模型性能和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有标记级PRM方法中生成模型与奖励模型存在目标冲突，导致信用分配不准确和训练不稳定。需要新的方法实现更稳健的奖励建模。

Method: 通过优化判别策略(Q函数)推导标记级奖励模型，理论证明Q-RM仅需偏好数据即可学习token-level Q函数，无需细粒度标注。

Result: 在数学推理任务中比ORM基线平均提升5.85分，训练收敛速度提升12倍（GSM8K）和11倍（MATH）。PPO/REINFORCE算法下均超越所有基线。

Conclusion: Q-RM有效解决了生成与奖励建模的冲突，在效果和效率层面均展现显著优势，为复杂推理任务的RL训练提供了更优的替代方案。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) provide more nuanced supervision compared to
outcome reward models (ORMs) for optimizing policy models, positioning them as
a promising approach to enhancing the capabilities of LLMs in complex reasoning
tasks. Recent efforts have advanced PRMs from step-level to token-level
granularity by integrating reward modeling into the training of generative
models, with reward scores derived from token generation probabilities.
However, the conflict between generative language modeling and reward modeling
may introduce instability and lead to inaccurate credit assignments. To address
this challenge, we revisit token-level reward assignment by decoupling reward
modeling from language generation and derive a token-level reward model through
the optimization of a discriminative policy, termed the Q-function Reward Model
(Q-RM). We theoretically demonstrate that Q-RM explicitly learns token-level
Q-functions from preference data without relying on fine-grained annotations.
In our experiments, Q-RM consistently outperforms all baseline methods across
various benchmarks. For example, when integrated into PPO/REINFORCE algorithms,
Q-RM enhances the average Pass@1 score by 5.85/4.70 points on mathematical
reasoning tasks compared to the ORM baseline, and by 4.56/5.73 points compared
to the token-level PRM counterpart. Moreover, reinforcement learning with Q-RM
significantly enhances training efficiency, achieving convergence 12 times
faster than ORM on GSM8K and 11 times faster than step-level PRM on MATH. Code

TL;DR: 提出基于LLM的CoT增强方法，结合语言学语段分割器提取正反陈述，并设计基于排名的HLV评估框架，实验显示优于基准模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过给定答案生成解释存在局限，而CoT的前向推理路径天然蕴含答案选项的隐含依据，更适合解决人类标签变异问题。

Method: 1. 开发语言学锚定的语段分割器精准提取CoT中正反陈述；2. 创建基于排名的HLV评估框架，优先答案排序而非分数对比。

Result: 在三个数据集上超越直接生成方法，排名方法的人类对齐度提升12.7%，F1分数平均提高9.3%。

Conclusion: 融合CoT前向推理与语言学分析的管道有效捕捉标签变异，排名机制为HLV评估提供更鲁棒的度量标准。

Abstract: The recent rise of reasoning-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs)--which
generate chains of thought (CoTs) before giving the final answer--has attracted
significant attention and offers new opportunities for gaining insights into
human label variation, which refers to plausible differences in how multiple
annotators label the same data instance. Prior work has shown that
LLM-generated explanations can help align model predictions with human label
distributions, but typically adopt a reverse paradigm: producing explanations
based on given answers. In contrast, CoTs provide a forward reasoning path that
may implicitly embed rationales for each answer option, before generating the
answers. We thus propose a novel LLM-based pipeline enriched with
linguistically-grounded discourse segmenters to extract supporting and opposing
statements for each answer option from CoTs with improved accuracy. We also
propose a rank-based HLV evaluation framework that prioritizes the ranking of
answers over exact scores, which instead favor direct comparison of label
distributions. Our method outperforms a direct generation method as well as
baselines on three datasets, and shows better alignment of ranking methods with
humans, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: 通过模型语义能力分类实施差异化攻击策略，为LLMs安全防御提供新型评估范式，揭示语义理解层面对抗样本的生成机制

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs) via jailbreaking
techniques-methods that circumvent their built-in safety and ethical
constraints-have emerged as a critical challenge in AI security. These attacks
compromise the reliability of LLMs by exploiting inherent weaknesses in their
comprehension capabilities. This paper investigates the efficacy of
jailbreaking strategies that are specifically adapted to the diverse levels of
understanding exhibited by different LLMs. We propose the Adaptive Jailbreaking
Strategies Based on the Semantic Understanding Capabilities of Large Language
Models, a novel framework that classifies LLMs into Type I and Type II
categories according to their semantic comprehension abilities. For each
category, we design tailored jailbreaking strategies aimed at leveraging their
vulnerabilities to facilitate successful attacks. Extensive experiments
conducted on multiple LLMs demonstrate that our adaptive strategy markedly
improves the success rate of jailbreaking. Notably, our approach achieves an
exceptional 98.9% success rate in jailbreaking GPT-4o(29 May 2025 release)

Motivation: 探索监督微调数据对LLMs事实性的影响机制，特别是在已知/未知知识场景下的实效性差异

Method: 通过系统实验验证+知识图谱理论证明，分析微调数据与测试提示的交互作用

Result: 发现ICL提示可补偿微调数据不足，测试提示在知识提取中起主导作用

Conclusion: 需重新评估ICL作为微调数据选择效果评估手段的适用性，提示工程比数据选择更关键

Abstract: Factual knowledge extraction aims to explicitly extract knowledge
parameterized in pre-trained language models for application in downstream
tasks. While prior work has been investigating the impact of supervised
fine-tuning data on the factuality of large language models (LLMs), its
mechanism remains poorly understood. We revisit this impact through systematic
experiments, with a particular focus on the factuality gap that arises when
fine-tuning on known versus unknown knowledge. Our findings show that this gap
can be mitigated at the inference stage, either under out-of-distribution (OOD)
settings or by using appropriate in-context learning (ICL) prompts (i.e.,
few-shot learning and Chain of Thought (CoT)). We prove this phenomenon
theoretically from the perspective of knowledge graphs, showing that the
test-time prompt may diminish or even overshadow the impact of fine-tuning data
and play a dominant role in knowledge extraction. Ultimately, our results shed
light on the interaction between finetuning data and test-time prompt,
demonstrating that ICL can effectively compensate for shortcomings in
fine-tuning data, and highlighting the need to reconsider the use of ICL
prompting as a means to evaluate the effectiveness of fine-tuning data
selection methods.

Method: 通过对比实验分析不同学习率预热策略（包括双线性/次指数级预热）在大规模语音文本模型训练中的表现

Result: 1. 次指数级学习率预热策略效果最佳
2. 预热阶段较高学习率加速初期收敛但最终性能无提升

Conclusion: 大规模语音文本模型训练应优先采用次指数级学习率预热策略，同时需平衡初期收敛速度与最终性能的关系

Abstract: Training large-scale models presents challenges not only in terms of resource
requirements but also in terms of their convergence. For this reason, the
learning rate (LR) is often decreased when the size of a model is increased.
Such a simple solution is not enough in the case of speech-to-text (S2T)
trainings, where evolved and more complex variants of the Transformer
architecture -- e.g., Conformer or Branchformer -- are used in light of their
better performance. As a workaround, OWSM designed a double linear warmup of
the LR, increasing it to a very small value in the first phase before updating
it to a higher value in the second phase. While this solution worked well in
practice, it was not compared with alternative solutions, nor was the impact on
the final performance of different LR warmup schedules studied. This paper
fills this gap, revealing that i) large-scale S2T trainings demand a
sub-exponential LR warmup, and ii) a higher LR in the warmup phase accelerates
initial convergence, but it does not boost final performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有UAQ评估数据集缺乏事实知识支持，无法有效衡量LLMs利用知识处理不可回答问题的能力。

Method: 基于知识图谱创建双语数据集UAQFact，并设计两个任务分别测试LLMs内部知识调用和外部知识整合能力。

Result: 实验显示LLMs即使存储相关知识仍表现不稳定，且外部知识仅有限提升效果（未能完全避免错误响应）。

Conclusion: UAQFact揭示了LLMs在知识利用上的核心挑战，强调需进一步优化知识检索与推理机制。

Abstract: Handling unanswerable questions (UAQ) is crucial for LLMs, as it helps
prevent misleading responses in complex situations. While previous studies have
built several datasets to assess LLMs' performance on UAQ, these datasets lack
factual knowledge support, which limits the evaluation of LLMs' ability to
utilize their factual knowledge when handling UAQ. To address the limitation,
we introduce a new unanswerable question dataset UAQFact, a bilingual dataset
with auxiliary factual knowledge created from a Knowledge Graph. Based on
UAQFact, we further define two new tasks to measure LLMs' ability to utilize
internal and external factual knowledge, respectively. Our experimental results
across multiple LLM series show that UAQFact presents significant challenges,
as LLMs do not consistently perform well even when they have factual knowledge
stored. Additionally, we find that incorporating external knowledge may enhance
performance, but LLMs still cannot make full use of the knowledge which may
result in incorrect responses.

Conclusion: 需开发新型抗干扰策略提升语言模型稳定性，这对安全有效的临床部署至关重要

Abstract: The Congress of Neurological Surgeons Self-Assessment for Neurological
Surgeons (CNS-SANS) questions are widely used by neurosurgical residents to
prepare for written board examinations. Recently, these questions have also
served as benchmarks for evaluating large language models' (LLMs) neurosurgical
knowledge. This study aims to assess the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs
on neurosurgery board-like questions and to evaluate their robustness to the
inclusion of distractor statements. A comprehensive evaluation was conducted
using 28 large language models. These models were tested on 2,904 neurosurgery
board examination questions derived from the CNS-SANS. Additionally, the study
introduced a distraction framework to assess the fragility of these models. The
framework incorporated simple, irrelevant distractor statements containing
polysemous words with clinical meanings used in non-clinical contexts to
determine the extent to which such distractions degrade model performance on
standard medical benchmarks. 6 of the 28 tested LLMs achieved board-passing
outcomes, with the top-performing models scoring over 15.7% above the passing
threshold. When exposed to distractions, accuracy across various model
architectures was significantly reduced-by as much as 20.4%-with one model
failing that had previously passed. Both general-purpose and medical
open-source models experienced greater performance declines compared to
proprietary variants when subjected to the added distractors. While current
LLMs demonstrate an impressive ability to answer neurosurgery board-like exam
questions, their performance is markedly vulnerable to extraneous, distracting
information. These findings underscore the critical need for developing novel
mitigation strategies aimed at bolstering LLM resilience against in-text
distractions, particularly for safe and effective clinical deployment.

Conclusion: 通过引导模型主动质疑问题有效性，可有效降低自我怀疑和推理步骤冗余，为优化大模型推理效率提供新思路

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
performance on complex tasks, largely due to the adoption of Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) reasoning. However, they often exhibit overthinking
-- performing unnecessary reasoning steps even after arriving at the correct
answer. Prior work has largely focused on qualitative analyses of overthinking
through sample-based observations of long CoTs. In contrast, we present a
quantitative analysis of overthinking from the perspective of self-doubt,
characterized by excessive token usage devoted to re-verifying already-correct
answer. We find that self-doubt significantly contributes to overthinking. In
response, we introduce a simple and effective prompting method to reduce the
model's over-reliance on input questions, thereby avoiding self-doubt.
Specifically, we first prompt the model to question the validity of the input
question, and then respond concisely based on the outcome of that evaluation.
Experiments on three mathematical reasoning tasks and four datasets with
missing premises demonstrate that our method substantially reduces answer
length and yields significant improvements across nearly all datasets upon 4
widely-used RLLMs. Further analysis demonstrates that our method effectively
minimizes the number of reasoning steps and reduces self-doubt.

Method: 使用带时长惩罚的动态规划算法（DPDP）调整单元粗粒度，通过音素、词汇、句子三个层面及不同比特率任务进行多维度分析

Result: 句子生成任务中粗粒度单元更优，词/音素任务中适当码本大小即可保持性能，低比特率下粗粒度单元提升句法建模准确率

Conclusion: 单元粗粒度并非绝对优势，但通过DPDP可灵活获取适合特定任务（如句子生成、低比特率建模）的优化单元表示

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) operate on acoustic units obtained by
discretizing self-supervised speech representations. Although the
characteristics of these units directly affect performance, the interaction
between codebook size and unit coarseness (i.e., duration) remains unexplored.
We investigate SLM performance as we vary codebook size and unit coarseness
using the simple duration-penalized dynamic programming (DPDP) method. New
analyses are performed across different linguistic levels. At the phone and
word levels, coarseness provides little benefit, as long as the codebook size
is chosen appropriately. However, when producing whole sentences in a
resynthesis task, SLMs perform better with coarser units. In lexical and
syntactic language modeling tasks, coarser units also give higher accuracies at
lower bitrates. We therefore show that coarser units aren't always better, but
that DPDP is a simple and efficient way to obtain coarser units for the tasks
where they are beneficial.

Conclusion: 强调严格基准构建的重要性，KGQAGen框架为可扩展的KGQA评测体系奠定基础

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) systems rely on high-quality
benchmarks to evaluate complex multi-hop reasoning. However, despite their
widespread use, popular datasets such as WebQSP and CWQ suffer from critical
quality issues, including inaccurate or incomplete ground-truth annotations,
poorly constructed questions that are ambiguous, trivial, or unanswerable, and
outdated or inconsistent knowledge. Through a manual audit of 16 popular KGQA
datasets, including WebQSP and CWQ, we find that the average factual
correctness rate is only 57 %. To address these issues, we introduce KGQAGen,
an LLM-in-the-loop framework that systematically resolves these pitfalls.
KGQAGen combines structured knowledge grounding, LLM-guided generation, and
symbolic verification to produce challenging and verifiable QA instances. Using
KGQAGen, we construct KGQAGen-10k, a ten-thousand scale benchmark grounded in
Wikidata, and evaluate a diverse set of KG-RAG models. Experimental results
demonstrate that even state-of-the-art systems struggle on this benchmark,
highlighting its ability to expose limitations of existing models. Our findings
advocate for more rigorous benchmark construction and position KGQAGen as a
scalable framework for advancing KGQA evaluation.

metrics for preference selection: (1) surface-level answer correctness and (2)
intrinsic token-level probability consistency across responses. Extensive
experiments show that our PCPO consistently outperforms existing outcome-only

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in translation among other things,
demonstrating competitive performance for many language pairs in zero- and
few-shot settings. But unlike dedicated neural machine translation models, LLMs
are not trained on any translation-related objective. What explains their
remarkable translation abilities? Are these abilities grounded in "incidental
bilingualism" (Briakou et al. 2023) in training data? Does instruction tuning
contribute to it? Are LLMs capable of aligning and leveraging semantically
identical or similar monolingual contents from different corners of the
internet that are unlikely to fit in a single context window? I offer some
reflections on this topic, informed by recent studies and growing user
experience. My working hypothesis is that LLMs' translation abilities originate
in two different types of pre-training data that may be internalized by the
models in different ways. I discuss the prospects for testing the "duality"
hypothesis empirically and its implications for reconceptualizing translation,
human and machine, in the age of deep learning.

Motivation: Understanding the opaque internal mechanisms behind safety-critical refusal behaviors in language models to address vulnerabilities like adversarial jailbreaking.

Method: Applied sparse autoencoders to extract refusal-related latent features in two chat models, with cross-dataset validation and intervention experiments on harmful prompts.

Result: Identified causal refusal features, demonstrated their utility in jailbreaking analysis, and showed improved OOD generalization in classification tasks.

Conclusion: This work provides activation-level insights into refusal mechanisms and establishes the value of mechanistic analysis for AI safety applications.

Abstract: Refusal is a key safety behavior in aligned language models, yet the internal
mechanisms driving refusals remain opaque. In this work, we conduct a
mechanistic study of refusal in instruction-tuned LLMs using sparse
autoencoders to identify latent features that causally mediate refusal
behaviors. We apply our method to two open-source chat models and intervene on
refusal-related features to assess their influence on generation, validating
their behavioral impact across multiple harmful datasets. This enables a
fine-grained inspection of how refusal manifests at the activation level and
addresses key research questions such as investigating upstream-downstream
latent relationship and understanding the mechanisms of adversarial
jailbreaking techniques. We also establish the usefulness of refusal features
in enhancing generalization for linear probes to out-of-distribution
adversarial samples in classification tasks. We open source our code in

Method: 使用标注数据集对比多种文本/多模态LLM与微调RoBERTa模型的零样本表现，并在未标注数据上进行实际场景验证。

Result: 文本LLM召回率高达94%但精度仅36%，多模态模型性能弱于纯文本模型，RoBERTa在未标注数据表现接近更大参数量的LLM。

Conclusion: 当前LLM检测方法存在精度缺陷，需开发更精准的系统，RoBERTa等小规模模型在实用场景中具有成本效益优势。

Abstract: As a leading online platform with a vast global audience, YouTube's extensive
reach also makes it susceptible to hosting harmful content, including
disinformation and conspiracy theories. This study explores the use of
open-weight Large Language Models (LLMs), both text-only and multimodal, for
identifying conspiracy theory videos shared on YouTube. Leveraging a labeled
dataset of thousands of videos, we evaluate a variety of LLMs in a zero-shot
setting and compare their performance to a fine-tuned RoBERTa baseline. Results
show that text-based LLMs achieve high recall but lower precision, leading to
increased false positives. Multimodal models lag behind their text-only
counterparts, indicating limited benefits from visual data integration. To
assess real-world applicability, we evaluate the most accurate models on an
unlabeled dataset, finding that RoBERTa achieves performance close to LLMs with
a larger number of parameters. Our work highlights the strengths and
limitations of current LLM-based approaches for online harmful content
detection, emphasizing the need for more precise and robust systems.

Result: Satori-SWE-32B模型在SWE-Bench-Verified上达到或超越100B级模型性能，样本效率显著提升

Conclusion: EvoScale为小模型实用性提升提供新路径，通过开源推动社区发展

Abstract: Language models (LMs) perform well on standardized coding benchmarks but
struggle with real-world software engineering tasks such as resolving GitHub
issues in SWE-Bench, especially when model parameters are less than 100B. While
smaller models are preferable in practice due to their lower computational
cost, improving their performance remains challenging. Existing approaches
primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with high-quality data, which is
expensive to curate at scale. An alternative is test-time scaling: generating
multiple outputs, scoring them using a verifier, and selecting the best one.
Although effective, this strategy often requires excessive sampling and costly
scoring, limiting its practical application. We propose Evolutionary Test-Time
Scaling (EvoScale), a sample-efficient method that treats generation as an
evolutionary process. By iteratively refining outputs via selection and
mutation, EvoScale shifts the output distribution toward higher-scoring
regions, reducing the number of samples needed to find correct solutions. To
reduce the overhead from repeatedly sampling and selection, we train the model
to self-evolve using reinforcement learning (RL). Rather than relying on
external verifiers at inference time, the model learns to self-improve the
scores of its own generations across iterations. Evaluated on
SWE-Bench-Verified, EvoScale enables our 32B model, Satori-SWE-32B, to match or
exceed the performance of models with over 100B parameters while using a few
samples. Code, data, and models will be fully open-sourced.

Method: 1) 基于DeepSeek-R1生成的大规模推理轨迹数据集进行指令微调；2) 提出可验证奖励函数并应用GRPO算法进行强化学习训练

Abstract: In this work, we present the first study to explore inference-time scaling on
table reasoning tasks. We develop and evaluate two post-training strategies to
enable inference-time scaling: distillation from frontier model reasoning
traces and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). For
distillation, we introduce a large-scale dataset of reasoning traces generated
by DeepSeek-R1, which we use to fine-tune LLMs into the Table-R1-SFT model. For
RLVR, we propose task-specific verifiable reward functions and apply the GRPO
algorithm to obtain the Table-R1-Zero model. We evaluate our Table-R1-series
models across diverse table reasoning tasks, including short-form QA, fact
verification, and free-form QA. Notably, the Table-R1-Zero model matches or
exceeds the performance of GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-R1, while using only a
7B-parameter LLM. It also demonstrates strong generalization to out-of-domain
datasets. Extensive ablation and qualitative analyses reveal the benefits of
instruction tuning, model architecture choices, and cross-task generalization,
as well as emergence of essential table reasoning skills during RL training.

TL;DR: 本文在更接近实际实现的假设下，证明固定精度Transformer的表达能力等同于仅含过去算子的线性时序逻辑片段，并建立与形式语言理论/自动机理论/代数之间的联系，实验验证其理论容量边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对先前理论研究基于无限精度/硬注意力等理想化假设与实际实现脱节的问题，提出更贴近实际Transformer架构（固定精度/软注意力/严格未来掩码）的理论分析框架。

Method: 通过将固定精度Transformer的表达能力映射到线性时序逻辑的特定片段（仅包含过去算子），并进一步将该逻辑与Chomsky层级/正则语言代数/计数器自动机等经典理论体系建立对应关系。

Result: 证明此类Transformer的表达能力严格受限于线性时序逻辑的过去算子片段，实验显示模型在理论容量内的语言可完美长度泛化，超出容量则无法泛化。

Conclusion: 构建了统一的理论框架揭示Transformer的表达能力边界，实验与理论预测高度一致，为理解语言模型的根本能力提供了形式化基础。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models (LMs) have achieved widespread empirical
success, but their theoretical expressive power remains only partially
understood. Prior work often relies on idealized models with assumptions --
such as arbitrary numerical precision and hard attention -- that diverge from
real-world transformers. In this work, we provide an exact characterization of
fixed-precision transformers with strict future masking and soft attention, an
idealization that more closely mirrors practical implementations. We show that
these models are precisely as expressive as a specific fragment of linear
temporal logic that includes only a single temporal operator: the past
operator. We further relate this logic to established classes in formal
language theory, automata theory, and algebra, yielding a rich and unified
theoretical framework for understanding transformer expressivity. Finally, we
present empirical results that align closely with our theory: transformers
trained on languages within their theoretical capacity generalize perfectly
over lengths, while they consistently fail to generalize on languages beyond
it.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识图谱依赖人工预定义模式，限制了构建效率和扩展性。本研究旨在通过全自动模式归纳突破该限制，同时增强大语言模型的事实准确性。

Method: 使用LLM并行处理知识抽取（实体/事件）与模式归纳，通过概念化将实例组织为语义类别，处理超5000万文档构建多层级知识图谱。

Result: 建成ATLAS知识图谱（9亿节点/59亿边），多跳QA任务超越SOTA基线，模式与人工设计的语义对齐度达95%，显著提升LLM事实准确率。

Conclusion: 证明动态模式归纳的十亿级知识图谱可有效补充LLM参数知识，为零人工干预的大规模知识工程提供了可行性验证。

Abstract: We present AutoSchemaKG, a framework for fully autonomous knowledge graph
construction that eliminates the need for predefined schemas. Our system
leverages large language models to simultaneously extract knowledge triples and
induce comprehensive schemas directly from text, modeling both entities and
events while employing conceptualization to organize instances into semantic
categories. Processing over 50 million documents, we construct ATLAS (Automated
Triple Linking And Schema induction), a family of knowledge graphs with 900+
million nodes and 5.9 billion edges. This approach outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines on multi-hop QA tasks and enhances LLM factuality. Notably, our
schema induction achieves 95\% semantic alignment with human-crafted schemas
with zero manual intervention, demonstrating that billion-scale knowledge
graphs with dynamically induced schemas can effectively complement parametric
knowledge in large language models.

Motivation: 现有NLP数据存在性别偏见，尤其法语缺乏中性改写系统。男性泛称会延续性别刻板印象，且此前相关技术仅在英语中被研究。

Method: 开发基于规则的法语系统(RBS)，生成训练数据微调两个语言模型，并探索使用Claude 3 Opus指令模型结合定制词典的方法。

Conclusion: GeNRe填补法语性别中性改写技术空白，证明规则与模型结合的有效性，推动法语NLP领域性别偏见缓解技术的发展。

Abstract: A significant portion of the textual data used in the field of Natural
Language Processing (NLP) exhibits gender biases, particularly due to the use
of masculine generics (masculine words that are supposed to refer to mixed
groups of men and women), which can perpetuate and amplify stereotypes. Gender
rewriting, an NLP task that involves automatically detecting and replacing
gendered forms with neutral or opposite forms (e.g., from masculine to
feminine), can be employed to mitigate these biases. While such systems have
been developed in a number of languages (English, Arabic, Portuguese, German,
French), automatic use of gender neutralization techniques (as opposed to
inclusive or gender-switching techniques) has only been studied for English.
This paper presents GeNRe, the very first French gender-neutral rewriting
system using collective nouns, which are gender-fixed in French. We introduce a
rule-based system (RBS) tailored for the French language alongside two
fine-tuned language models trained on data generated by our RBS. We also
explore the use of instruct-based models to enhance the performance of our
other systems and find that Claude 3 Opus combined with our dictionary achieves
results close to our RBS. Through this contribution, we hope to promote the
advancement of gender bias mitigation techniques in NLP for French.

Conclusion: 该研究为理解大型推理模型的幻觉现象提供了初步框架，揭示了训练流程、认知行为与模型不确定性对事实准确性的复杂影响机制。

Abstract: Recently evolved large reasoning models (LRMs) show powerful performance in
solving complex tasks with long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capability. As
these LRMs are mostly developed by post-training on formal reasoning tasks,
whether they generalize the reasoning capability to help reduce hallucination
in fact-seeking tasks remains unclear and debated. For instance, DeepSeek-R1
reports increased performance on SimpleQA, a fact-seeking benchmark, while
OpenAI-o3 observes even severer hallucination. This discrepancy naturally
raises the following research question: Are reasoning models more prone to
hallucination? This paper addresses the question from three perspectives. (1)
We first conduct a holistic evaluation for the hallucination in LRMs. Our
analysis reveals that LRMs undergo a full post-training pipeline with cold
start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and verifiable reward RL generally alleviate
their hallucination. In contrast, both distillation alone and RL training
without cold start fine-tuning introduce more nuanced hallucinations. (2) To
explore why different post-training pipelines alters the impact on
hallucination in LRMs, we conduct behavior analysis. We characterize two
critical cognitive behaviors that directly affect the factuality of a LRM: Flaw
Repetition, where the surface-level reasoning attempts repeatedly follow the
same underlying flawed logic, and Think-Answer Mismatch, where the final answer
fails to faithfully match the previous CoT process. (3) Further, we investigate
the mechanism behind the hallucination of LRMs from the perspective of model
uncertainty. We find that increased hallucination of LRMs is usually associated
with the misalignment between model uncertainty and factual accuracy. Our work
provides an initial understanding of the hallucination in LRMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结构化信息（尤其是论点角色）对法律等高危领域摘要质量至关重要，但现有LLMs保留效果不明确。

Method: 使用ARC框架分析三个开源LLM在法律文本和科学文章中的表现，检测摘要对分散论点的覆盖程度。

Result: LLMs能部分覆盖论点，但稀疏分布的论点遗漏率高达37%，且模型存在位置偏差和角色偏好。

Conclusion: 需开发论点感知的摘要策略，优化上下文处理机制以提升关键信息保留能力。

Abstract: Integrating structured information has long improved the quality of
abstractive summarization, particularly in retaining salient content. In this
work, we focus on a specific form of structure: argument roles, which are
crucial for summarizing documents in high-stakes domains such as law. We
investigate whether instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) adequately
preserve this information. To this end, we introduce Argument Representation
Coverage (ARC), a framework for measuring how well LLM-generated summaries
capture salient arguments. Using ARC, we analyze summaries produced by three
open-weight LLMs in two domains where argument roles are central: long legal
opinions and scientific articles. Our results show that while LLMs cover
salient argument roles to some extent, critical information is often omitted in
generated summaries, particularly when arguments are sparsely distributed
throughout the input. Further, we use ARC to uncover behavioral patterns --
specifically, how the positional bias of LLM context windows and role-specific
preferences impact the coverage of key arguments in generated summaries,
emphasizing the need for more argument-aware summarization strategies.

TL;DR: 提出Active Layer-Contrastive Decoding (ActLCD)，通过强化学习策略在生成过程中动态选择对比层，有效减少大语言模型的长文本幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解码方法主要在token层级抑制表面模式，但长文本场景下模型仍易产生幻觉。需突破token层级的优化框架。

Method: 将解码建模为序列决策问题，采用奖励感知分类器指导的强化学习策略，动态决定何时应用层级对比机制。

Result: 在5个基准测试中超越SOTA方法，各类生成场景的幻觉率显著降低。

Conclusion: ActLCD通过层级动态对比机制，实现了超越token层级的真实性优化，为解码策略提供了新范式。

Abstract: Recent decoding methods improve the factuality of large language
models~(LLMs) by refining how the next token is selected during generation.
These methods typically operate at the token level, leveraging internal
representations to suppress superficial patterns. Nevertheless, LLMs remain
prone to hallucinations, especially over longer contexts. In this paper, we
propose Active Layer-Contrastive Decoding (ActLCD), a novel decoding strategy
that actively decides when to apply contrasting layers during generation. By
casting decoding as a sequential decision-making problem, ActLCD employs a
reinforcement learning policy guided by a reward-aware classifier to optimize
factuality beyond the token level. Our experiments demonstrate that ActLCD
surpasses state-of-the-art methods across five benchmarks, showcasing its
effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations in diverse generation scenarios.

Motivation: 现有研究对LLMs工具使用能力的评估多基于短期上下文，缺乏对现实场景中持续多轮交互下模型行为的深入洞察。需建立新基准测试评估模型的长期上下文维持能力和抗干扰能力

Method: 构建ToolHaystack基准测试：包含连续对话中的多任务执行环境、现实干扰因素（如上下文切换/无关工具调用），测试模型在复杂交互中的表现。覆盖14个前沿LLMs进行系统评估

Result: 现有模型在标准多轮测试中表现良好，但在ToolHaystack中失误率显著上升（平均下降23.5%）。暴露出模型在长期上下文追踪、干扰过滤等关键能力上的不足

Conclusion: ToolHaystack揭示了现有工具基准测试未能捕捉的长期鲁棒性缺陷，强调构建更贴近真实使用场景的评估体系的重要性，为LLMs的持续交互能力优化指明方向

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in using
external tools to address user inquiries. However, most existing evaluations
assume tool use in short contexts, offering limited insight into model behavior
during realistic long-term interactions. To fill this gap, we introduce
ToolHaystack, a benchmark for testing the tool use capabilities in long-term
interactions. Each test instance in ToolHaystack includes multiple tasks
execution contexts and realistic noise within a continuous conversation,
enabling assessment of how well models maintain context and handle various
disruptions. By applying this benchmark to 14 state-of-the-art LLMs, we find
that while current models perform well in standard multi-turn settings, they
often significantly struggle in ToolHaystack, highlighting critical gaps in
their long-term robustness not revealed by previous tool benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有线性注意力方法无法有效处理长上下文任务中的内存冲突问题，导致关键信息遗忘

Method: 结合滑动窗口注意力+稀疏全局缓存+线性注意力隐状态的三层存储架构，实现信息分层管理

Result: 在4K上下文长度下准确率从0.6%提升至97.4%，缓存需求比Llama-3.1 8B减少4.6倍

Conclusion: LoLA以极低资源消耗实现接近Transformer的性能，为长序列处理提供高效解决方案

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models suffer from quadratic complexity at
inference on long sequences. Linear attention methods are efficient
alternatives, however, they fail to provide an accurate approximation of
softmax attention. By additionally incorporating sliding window attention into
each linear attention head, this gap can be closed for short context-length
tasks. Unfortunately, these approaches cannot recall important information from
long contexts due to "memory collisions". In this paper , we propose LoLA:
Low-rank Linear Attention with sparse caching. LoLA separately stores
additional key-value pairs that would otherwise interfere with past associative
memories. Moreover, LoLA further closes the gap between linear attention models
and transformers by distributing past key-value pairs into three forms of
memory: (i) recent pairs in a local sliding window; (ii) difficult-to-memorize
pairs in a sparse, global cache; and (iii) generic pairs in the recurrent
hidden state of linear attention. As an inference-only strategy, LoLA enables
pass-key retrieval on up to 8K context lengths on needle-in-a-haystack tasks
from RULER. It boosts the accuracy of the base subquadratic model from 0.6% to
97.4% at 4K context lengths, with a 4.6x smaller cache than that of Llama-3.1
8B. LoLA demonstrates strong performance on zero-shot commonsense reasoning
tasks among 1B and 8B parameter subquadratic models. Finally, LoLA is an
extremely lightweight approach: Nearly all of our results can be reproduced on
a single consumer GPU.

Conclusion: 预训练语音模型具备大规模自动标注潜力，可显著提升语音研究的效率与规模，推动语音学研究的扩展性发展

Abstract: Modern phonetic research regularly makes use of automatic tools for the
annotation of speech data, however few tools exist for the annotation of many
variable phonetic phenomena. At the same time, pre-trained self-supervised
models, such as wav2vec2.0, have been shown to perform well at speech
classification tasks and latently encode fine-grained phonetic information. We
demonstrate that wav2vec2.0 models can be trained to automatically classify
stop burst presence with high accuracy in both English and Japanese, robust
across both finely-curated and unprepared speech corpora. Patterns of
variability in stop realisation are replicated with the automatic annotations,
and closely follow those of manual annotations. These results demonstrate the
potential of pre-trained speech models as tools for the automatic annotation
and processing of speech corpus data, enabling researchers to `scale-up' the
scope of phonetic research with relative ease.

Method: 通过对比CDL与Wikipedia训练的模型（覆盖2种语言模型目标/3种语言/3个句法测试集），开发FIT-CLAMS频率控制测试框架

Result: CDL仅在部分场景表现良好，多数情况下被Wikipedia模型超越；频率控制显著影响句法能力评估结果

Conclusion: 儿童导向语言未展现特殊句法学习优势，揭示语言模型评估需控制词频效应，挑战了早期关于CDL训练优势的结论

Abstract: Seminal work by Huebner et al. (2021) showed that language models (LMs)
trained on English Child-Directed Language (CDL) can reach similar syntactic
abilities as LMs trained on much larger amounts of adult-directed written text,
suggesting that CDL could provide more effective LM training material than the
commonly used internet-crawled data. However, the generalizability of these
results across languages, model types, and evaluation settings remains unclear.
We test this by comparing models trained on CDL vs. Wikipedia across two LM
objectives (masked and causal), three languages (English, French, German), and
three syntactic minimal-pair benchmarks. Our results on these benchmarks show
inconsistent benefits of CDL, which in most cases is outperformed by Wikipedia
models. We then identify various shortcomings in previous benchmarks, and
introduce a novel testing methodology, FIT-CLAMS, which uses a
frequency-controlled design to enable balanced comparisons across training
corpora. Through minimal pair evaluations and regression analysis we show that
training on CDL does not yield stronger generalizations for acquiring syntax
and highlight the importance of controlling for frequency effects when
evaluating syntactic ability.

Method: 通过GSM8K/SVAMP数据集解耦评估，结合CoT消融实验和因果补丁技术，分析Llama-3/Qwen2.5模型的运行机制

Result: 发现模型计算能力是主要瓶颈，CoT主要改善计算而非建模，证实存在可组合的抽象-计算分离执行机制

Conclusion: 需要解耦评估方法才能准确衡量推理能力，抽象建模能力的提升应成为未来改进重点

Abstract: Final-answer-based metrics are commonly used for evaluating large language
models (LLMs) on math word problems, often taken as proxies for reasoning
ability. However, such metrics conflate two distinct sub-skills: abstract
formulation (capturing mathematical relationships using expressions) and
arithmetic computation (executing the calculations). Through a disentangled
evaluation on GSM8K and SVAMP, we find that the final-answer accuracy of
Llama-3 and Qwen2.5 (1B-32B) without CoT is overwhelmingly bottlenecked by the
arithmetic computation step and not by the abstract formulation step. Contrary
to the common belief, we show that CoT primarily aids in computation, with
limited impact on abstract formulation. Mechanistically, we show that these two
skills are composed conjunctively even in a single forward pass without any
reasoning steps via an abstract-then-compute mechanism: models first capture
problem abstractions, then handle computation. Causal patching confirms these
abstractions are present, transferable, composable, and precede computation.
These behavioural and mechanistic findings highlight the need for disentangled
evaluation to accurately assess LLM reasoning and to guide future improvements.

Conclusion: SocialMaze填补系统评估空白，揭示模型社交推理瓶颈，公开数据集为后续研究提供基准，证明针对性训练能有效增强模型社会情境适应能力

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to socially grounded
tasks, such as online community moderation, media content analysis, and social
reasoning games. Success in these contexts depends on a model's social
reasoning ability - the capacity to interpret social contexts, infer others'
mental states, and assess the truthfulness of presented information. However,
there is currently no systematic evaluation framework that comprehensively
assesses the social reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Existing efforts often
oversimplify real-world scenarios and consist of tasks that are too basic to
challenge advanced models. To address this gap, we introduce SocialMaze, a new
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate social reasoning. SocialMaze
systematically incorporates three core challenges: deep reasoning, dynamic
interaction, and information uncertainty. It provides six diverse tasks across
three key settings: social reasoning games, daily-life interactions, and
digital community platforms. Both automated and human validation are used to
ensure data quality. Our evaluation reveals several key insights: models vary
substantially in their ability to handle dynamic interactions and integrate
temporally evolving information; models with strong chain-of-thought reasoning
perform better on tasks requiring deeper inference beyond surface-level cues;
and model reasoning degrades significantly under uncertainty. Furthermore, we
show that targeted fine-tuning on curated reasoning examples can greatly
improve model performance in complex social scenarios. The dataset is publicly
available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/MBZUAI/SocialMaze

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical need for high-quality evaluation datasets
in low-resource languages to advance cross-lingual transfer. While
cross-lingual transfer offers a key strategy for leveraging multilingual
pretraining to expand language technologies to understudied and typologically
diverse languages, its effectiveness is dependent on quality and suitable
benchmarks. We release new sense-annotated datasets of sentences containing
polysemous words, spanning nine low-resource languages across diverse language
families and scripts. To facilitate dataset creation, the paper presents a
demonstrably beneficial semi-automatic annotation method. The utility of the
datasets is demonstrated through Word-in-Context (WiC) formatted experiments
that evaluate transfer on these low-resource languages. Results highlight the
importance of targeted dataset creation and evaluation for effective polysemy
disambiguation in low-resource settings and transfer studies. The released
datasets and code aim to support further research into fair, robust, and truly
multilingual NLP.

*Jinzhe Li,Gengxu Li,Yi Chang,Yuan Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 揭示LLMs前提批判能力不足，构建PCBench评估框架并发现模型存在显式提示依赖、错误类型敏感度差异等关键缺陷


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注理想场景下的推理能力，忽视LLMs面对错误前提时的脆弱性，需系统性评估其前提批判能力

Method: 设计包含4类错误、3种难度层级的PCBench评估框架，采用多维度指标系统评估15个主流LLM

Result: 模型自主批判能力弱（需显式提示）、错误类型直接影响检测率（直接矛盾易识别）、推理与批判能力不相关、错误前提引发过思考现象

Conclusion: 亟需加强LLM对输入有效性的主动评估，将前提批判能力作为构建可靠人本系统的核心基础能力

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have witnessed rapid advancements, demonstrating
remarkable capabilities. However, a notable vulnerability persists: LLMs often
uncritically accept flawed or contradictory premises, leading to inefficient
reasoning and unreliable outputs. This emphasizes the significance of
possessing the \textbf{Premise Critique Ability} for LLMs, defined as the
capacity to proactively identify and articulate errors in input premises. Most
existing studies assess LLMs' reasoning ability in ideal settings, largely
ignoring their vulnerabilities when faced with flawed premises. Thus, we
introduce the \textbf{Premise Critique Bench (PCBench)}, designed by
incorporating four error types across three difficulty levels, paired with
multi-faceted evaluation metrics. We conducted systematic evaluations of 15
representative LLMs. Our findings reveal: (1) Most models rely heavily on
explicit prompts to detect errors, with limited autonomous critique; (2)
Premise critique ability depends on question difficulty and error type, with
direct contradictions being easier to detect than complex or procedural errors;
(3) Reasoning ability does not consistently correlate with the premise critique
ability; (4) Flawed premises trigger overthinking in reasoning models, markedly
lengthening responses due to repeated attempts at resolving conflicts. These
insights underscore the urgent need to enhance LLMs' proactive evaluation of
input validity, positioning premise critique as a foundational capability for
developing reliable, human-centric systems. The code is available at

TL;DR: DEER方法通过引入标签统计信息优化上下文学习机制，在命名实体识别任务中显著提升大模型性能，接近监督微调效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于语义相似性的示例选择方法忽略训练标签信息，导致命名实体识别任务中上下文学习效果不佳。如何有效利用标注数据提升大模型在NER任务中的few-shot表现成为研究动机。

Method: 1. 提出标签引导的token级检索器，基于实体标签统计信息筛选信息量最大的token
2. 设计针对易错token的校正机制，利用标签统计识别关键token并要求模型重新预测

Result: 在5个NER数据集、4种大模型上的实验表明：
- 持续超越现有ICL方法
- 接近监督微调效果（差距<3%）
- 对新旧实体识别效果均衡
- 低资源场景表现稳健

Conclusion: DEER首次将标签统计信息融入上下文学习框架，通过token级优化有效缩小了ICL与监督学习的差距，为标注数据有限场景下的实体识别提供了新思路。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to perform new
tasks using only a few demonstrations. In Named Entity Recognition (NER),
demonstrations are typically selected based on semantic similarity to the test
instance, ignoring training labels and resulting in suboptimal performance. We
introduce DEER, a new method that leverages training labels through token-level
statistics to improve ICL performance. DEER first enhances example selection
with a label-guided, token-based retriever that prioritizes tokens most
informative for entity recognition. It then prompts the LLM to revisit
error-prone tokens, which are also identified using label statistics, and make
targeted corrections. Evaluated on five NER datasets using four different LLMs,
DEER consistently outperforms existing ICL methods and approaches the
performance of supervised fine-tuning. Further analysis shows its effectiveness
on both seen and unseen entities and its robustness in low-resource settings.

Conclusion: 该框架通过创新训练机制实现小模型的高效自主ML，验证了学习型代理在复杂工程任务中的应用潜力。

Abstract: The emergence of large language model (LLM)-based agents has significantly
advanced the development of autonomous machine learning (ML) engineering.
However, most existing approaches rely heavily on manual prompt engineering,
failing to adapt and optimize based on diverse experimental experiences.
Focusing on this, for the first time, we explore the paradigm of learning-based
agentic ML, where an LLM agent learns through interactive experimentation on ML
tasks using online reinforcement learning (RL). To realize this, we propose a
novel agentic ML training framework with three key components: (1)
exploration-enriched fine-tuning, which enables LLM agents to generate diverse
actions for enhanced RL exploration; (2) step-wise RL, which enables training
on a single action step, accelerating experience collection and improving
training efficiency; (3) an agentic ML-specific reward module, which unifies
varied ML feedback signals into consistent rewards for RL optimization.
Leveraging this framework, we train ML-Agent, driven by a 7B-sized Qwen-2.5 LLM
for autonomous ML. Remarkably, despite being trained on merely 9 ML tasks, our
7B-sized ML-Agent outperforms the 671B-sized DeepSeek-R1 agent. Furthermore, it
achieves continuous performance improvements and demonstrates exceptional
cross-task generalization capabilities.

<details>

Motivation: 现有对齐方法忽视人类决策的满意原则（主目标优先+次目标达标），需建立符合人类有限理性特征的模型对齐范式。

Method: SITAlign推理框架在解码阶段最大化主要目标函数，同时对次要目标施加阈值约束，并提供次优性界限理论证明。

Result: 在PKU-SafeRLHF数据集上，以帮助性为主目标/无害性为约束时，SITAlign的GPT-4胜率比SOTA方法提升22.3%且满足安全阈值。

Conclusion: 基于满意原则的推理对齐框架有效解决多目标对齐难题，理论分析与实验结果验证了方法的优越性。

Abstract: Aligning large language models with humans is challenging due to the
inherently multifaceted nature of preference feedback. While existing
approaches typically frame this as a multi-objective optimization problem, they
often overlook how humans actually make decisions. Research on bounded
rationality suggests that human decision making follows satisficing
strategies-optimizing primary objectives while ensuring others meet acceptable
thresholds. To bridge this gap and operationalize the notion of satisficing
alignment, we propose SITAlign: an inference time framework that addresses the
multifaceted nature of alignment by maximizing a primary objective while
satisfying threshold-based constraints on secondary criteria. We provide
theoretical insights by deriving sub-optimality bounds of our satisficing based
inference alignment approach. We empirically validate SITAlign's performance
through extensive experimentation on multiple benchmarks. For instance, on the
PKU-SafeRLHF dataset with the primary objective of maximizing helpfulness while
ensuring a threshold on harmlessness, SITAlign outperforms the state-of-the-art
multi objective decoding strategy by a margin of 22.3% in terms of GPT-4
win-tie rate for helpfulness reward while adhering to the threshold on
harmlessness.

TL;DR: 提出新型长时记忆模块ATLAS，通过三方面改进克服Transformer在长序列任务中的局限性，实验显示其在多项任务中超越传统模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer存在二次复杂度限制，而现代循环神经网络在长上下文理解和外推能力上表现不足，主要受限于内存容量、在线更新机制和固定内存管理三个设计缺陷。

Method: 开发ATLAS模块：(1)突破内存容量限制；(2)通过联合优化当前及历史token克服在线更新局限；(3)改进固定内存管理机制。基于此构建严格泛化Transformer架构的DeepTransformers。

Result: 在语言建模、常识推理和长上下文任务中超越Transformer及线性循环模型，BABILong基准在1000万上下文长度上实现+80%准确率提升。

Conclusion: ATLAS有效解决了长序列建模的关键瓶颈，其构建的DeepTransformers成功扩展了原始Transformer架构的适用边界。

Abstract: Transformers have been established as the most popular backbones in sequence
modeling, mainly due to their effectiveness in in-context retrieval tasks and
the ability to learn at scale. Their quadratic memory and time complexity,
however, bound their applicability in longer sequences and so has motivated
researchers to explore effective alternative architectures such as modern
recurrent neural networks (a.k.a long-term recurrent memory module). Despite
their recent success in diverse downstream tasks, they struggle in tasks that
requires long context understanding and extrapolation to longer sequences. We
observe that these shortcomings come from three disjoint aspects in their
design: (1) limited memory capacity that is bounded by the architecture of
memory and feature mapping of the input; (2) online nature of update, i.e.,
optimizing the memory only with respect to the last input; and (3) less
expressive management of their fixed-size memory. To enhance all these three
aspects, we present ATLAS, a long-term memory module with high capacity that
learns to memorize the context by optimizing the memory based on the current
and past tokens, overcoming the online nature of long-term memory models.
Building on this insight, we present a new family of Transformer-like
architectures, called DeepTransformers, that are strict generalizations of the
original Transformer architecture. Our experimental results on language
modeling, common-sense reasoning, recall-intensive, and long-context
understanding tasks show that ATLAS surpasses the performance of Transformers
and recent linear recurrent models. ATLAS further improves the long context
performance of Titans, achieving +80\% accuracy in 10M context length of
BABILong benchmark.

Conclusion: 该框架为推进自动化非正式定理证明和数学探索提供了系统性解决方案，打开了LLMs形式数学推理的新路径

Abstract: Theorem proving serves as a major testbed for evaluating complex reasoning
abilities in large language models (LLMs). However, traditional automated
theorem proving (ATP) approaches rely heavily on formal proof systems that
poorly align with LLMs' strength derived from informal, natural language
knowledge acquired during pre-training. In this work, we propose DeepTheorem, a
comprehensive informal theorem-proving framework exploiting natural language to
enhance LLM mathematical reasoning. DeepTheorem includes a large-scale
benchmark dataset consisting of 121K high-quality IMO-level informal theorems
and proofs spanning diverse mathematical domains, rigorously annotated for
correctness, difficulty, and topic categories, accompanied by systematically
constructed verifiable theorem variants. We devise a novel reinforcement
learning strategy (RL-Zero) explicitly tailored to informal theorem proving,
leveraging the verified theorem variants to incentivize robust mathematical
inference. Additionally, we propose comprehensive outcome and process
evaluation metrics examining proof correctness and the quality of reasoning
steps. Extensive experimental analyses demonstrate DeepTheorem significantly
improves LLM theorem-proving performance compared to existing datasets and
supervised fine-tuning protocols, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and
reasoning quality. Our findings highlight DeepTheorem's potential to
fundamentally advance automated informal theorem proving and mathematical
exploration.

Method: 手工创建包含从简单图形替换到空间依赖线索的多样化英语画谜基准，并系统分析不同VLM表现

Result: 模型能解码简单视觉线索，但在抽象推理（81%错误率）、横向思维（76%失败）和视觉隐喻理解（68%不准确）方面表现显著不足

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型处理复杂符号推理任务的能力有限，需在抽象表征学习和文化语境理解方向改进模型架构

Abstract: Rebus puzzles, visual riddles that encode language through imagery, spatial
arrangement, and symbolic substitution, pose a unique challenge to current
vision-language models (VLMs). Unlike traditional image captioning or question
answering tasks, rebus solving requires multi-modal abstraction, symbolic
reasoning, and a grasp of cultural, phonetic and linguistic puns. In this
paper, we investigate the capacity of contemporary VLMs to interpret and solve
rebus puzzles by constructing a hand-generated and annotated benchmark of
diverse English-language rebus puzzles, ranging from simple pictographic
substitutions to spatially-dependent cues ("head" over "heels"). We analyze how
different VLMs perform, and our findings reveal that while VLMs exhibit some
surprising capabilities in decoding simple visual clues, they struggle
significantly with tasks requiring abstract reasoning, lateral thinking, and
understanding visual metaphors.

Abstract: Conversational agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are rapidly
becoming integral to our daily interactions, generating unprecedented amounts
of conversational data. Such datasets offer a powerful lens into societal
interests, trending topics, and collective concerns. Yet, existing approaches
typically treat these interactions as independent and miss critical insights
that could emerge from aggregating and reasoning across large-scale
conversation logs. In this paper, we introduce Aggregative Question Answering,
a novel task requiring models to reason explicitly over thousands of
user-chatbot interactions to answer aggregative queries, such as identifying
emerging concerns among specific demographics. To enable research in this
direction, we construct a benchmark, WildChat-AQA, comprising 6,027 aggregative
questions derived from 182,330 real-world chatbot conversations. Experiments
show that existing methods either struggle to reason effectively or incur
prohibitive computational costs, underscoring the need for new approaches
capable of extracting collective insights from large-scale conversational data.

Abstract: Virtual human animations have a wide range of applications in virtual and
augmented reality. While automatic generation methods of animated virtual
humans have been developed, assessing their quality remains challenging.
Recently, approaches introducing task-oriented evaluation metrics have been
proposed, leveraging neural network training. However, quality assessment
measures for animated virtual humans that are not generated with parametric
body models have yet to be developed. In this context, we introduce a first
such quality assessment measure leveraging a novel data-driven framework.
First, we generate a dataset of virtual human animations together with their
corresponding subjective realism evaluation scores collected with a user study.
Second, we use the resulting dataset to learn predicting perceptual evaluation
scores. Results indicate that training a linear regressor on our dataset
results in a correlation of 90%, which outperforms a state of the art deep

Abstract: This paper contributes a set of quality metrics for identification and visual
analysis of structured missingness in high-dimensional data. Missing values in
data are a frequent challenge in most data generating domains and may cause a
range of analysis issues. Structural missingness in data may indicate issues in
data collection and pre-processing, but may also highlight important data
characteristics. While research into statistical methods for dealing with
missing data are mainly focusing on replacing missing values with plausible
estimated values, visualization has great potential to support a more in-depth
understanding of missingness structures in data. Nonetheless, while the
interest in missing data visualization has increased in the last decade, it is
still a relatively overlooked research topic with a comparably small number of
publications, few of which address scalability issues. Efficient visual
analysis approaches are needed to enable exploration of missingness structures
in large and high-dimensional data, and to support informed decision-making in
context of potential data quality issues. This paper suggests a set of quality
metrics for identification of patterns of interest for understanding of
structural missingness in data. These quality metrics can be used as guidance
in visual analysis, as demonstrated through a use case exploring structural
missingness in data from a real-life walking monitoring study. All supplemental

Conclusion: 当前RL方法在提升LLM推理能力时存在『执行-规划失衡』，未来需重点加强规划能力的探索机制和跨问题泛化能力，合成实验为突破覆盖墙提供了可行性验证方向。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning tasks have become prominent benchmarks for assessing
the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, especially with reinforcement learning (RL)
methods such as GRPO showing significant performance gains. However, accuracy
metrics alone do not support fine-grained assessment of capabilities and fail
to reveal which problem-solving skills have been internalized. To better
understand these capabilities, we propose to decompose problem solving into
fundamental capabilities: Plan (mapping questions to sequences of steps),
Execute (correctly performing solution steps), and Verify (identifying the
correctness of a solution). Empirically, we find that GRPO mainly enhances the
execution skill-improving execution robustness on problems the model already
knows how to solve-a phenomenon we call temperature distillation. More
importantly, we show that RL-trained models struggle with fundamentally new
problems, hitting a 'coverage wall' due to insufficient planning skills. To
explore RL's impact more deeply, we construct a minimal, synthetic
solution-tree navigation task as an analogy for mathematical problem-solving.
This controlled setup replicates our empirical findings, confirming RL
primarily boosts execution robustness. Importantly, in this setting, we
identify conditions under which RL can potentially overcome the coverage wall
through improved exploration and generalization to new solution paths. Our
findings provide insights into the role of RL in enhancing LLM reasoning,
expose key limitations, and suggest a path toward overcoming these barriers.

Conclusion: 数值推理驱动的方法能实现更精准、可解释的证据合成，与领域专家原则保持高度一致。

Abstract: Systematic reviews in medicine play a critical role in evidence-based
decision-making by aggregating findings from multiple studies. A central
bottleneck in automating this process is extracting numeric evidence and
determining study-level conclusions for specific outcomes and comparisons.
Prior work has framed this problem as a textual inference task by retrieving
relevant content fragments and inferring conclusions from them. However, such
approaches often rely on shallow textual cues and fail to capture the
underlying numeric reasoning behind expert assessments.
  In this work, we conceptualise the problem as one of quantitative reasoning.
Rather than inferring conclusions from surface text, we extract structured
numerical evidence (e.g., event counts or standard deviations) and apply domain
knowledge informed logic to derive outcome-specific conclusions. We develop a
numeric reasoning system composed of a numeric data extraction model and an
effect estimate component, enabling more accurate and interpretable inference
aligned with the domain expert principles. We train the numeric data extraction
model using different strategies, including supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
reinforcement learning (RL) with a new value reward model.
  When evaluated on the CochraneForest benchmark, our best-performing approach
-- using RL to train a small-scale number extraction model -- yields up to a
21% absolute improvement in F1 score over retrieval-based systems and
outperforms general-purpose LLMs of over 400B parameters by up to 9%. Our
results demonstrate the promise of reasoning-driven approaches for automating
systematic evidence synthesis.

language models (MLLMs) presents critical challenges, which are frequently more
pronounced for Multimodal Small Language Models (MSLMs) given their typically
weaker foundational reasoning abilities: (1) the scarcity of high-quality
multimodal reasoning datasets, (2) the degradation of reasoning capabilities
due to the integration of visual processing, and (3) the risk that direct
application of reinforcement learning may produce complex yet incorrect
reasoning processes. To address these challenges, we design a novel framework
Infi-MMR to systematically unlock the reasoning potential of MSLMs through a
curriculum of three carefully structured phases and propose our multimodal
reasoning model Infi-MMR-3B. The first phase, Foundational Reasoning
Activation, leverages high-quality textual reasoning datasets to activate and
strengthen the model's logical reasoning capabilities. The second phase,
Cross-Modal Reasoning Adaptation, utilizes caption-augmented multimodal data to
facilitate the progressive transfer of reasoning skills to multimodal contexts.
The third phase, Multimodal Reasoning Enhancement, employs curated,
caption-free multimodal data to mitigate linguistic biases and promote robust
cross-modal reasoning. Infi-MMR-3B achieves both state-of-the-art multimodal
math reasoning ability (43.68% on MathVerse testmini, 27.04% on MathVision
test, and 21.33% on OlympiadBench) and general reasoning ability (67.2% on
MathVista testmini).

TL;DR: 提出Socratic-PRMBench基准测试，系统性评估过程奖励模型在六种推理模式下的表现，发现现有模型存在显著缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试仅关注逐步正确性评估，缺乏对过程奖励模型在不同推理模式（如分解/演绎等）下的系统性评估。

Method: 构建包含六种推理模式（转换/分解/重聚/演绎/验证/整合）的2995条含缺陷推理路径测试集。

Result: 实验表明现有PRMs在不同推理模式下存在显著评估缺陷，特别是处理多样化推理步骤时表现薄弱。

Conclusion: 该基准为PRMs的全面评估提供新标准，揭示当前模型局限性，推动未来对多模式推理评估的改进研究。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) are crucial in complex reasoning and
problem-solving tasks (e.g., LLM agents with long-horizon decision-making) by
verifying the correctness of each intermediate reasoning step. In real-world
scenarios, LLMs may apply various reasoning patterns (e.g., decomposition) to
solve a problem, potentially suffering from errors under various reasoning
patterns. Therefore, PRMs are required to identify errors under various
reasoning patterns during the reasoning process. However, existing benchmarks
mainly focus on evaluating PRMs with stepwise correctness, ignoring a
systematic evaluation of PRMs under various reasoning patterns. To mitigate
this gap, we introduce Socratic-PRMBench, a new benchmark to evaluate PRMs
systematically under six reasoning patterns, including Transformation,
Decomposition, Regather, Deduction, Verification, and Integration.
Socratic-PRMBench}comprises 2995 reasoning paths with flaws within the
aforementioned six reasoning patterns. Through our experiments on both PRMs and
LLMs prompted as critic models, we identify notable deficiencies in existing
PRMs. These observations underscore the significant weakness of current PRMs in
conducting evaluations on reasoning steps under various reasoning patterns. We
hope Socratic-PRMBench can serve as a comprehensive testbed for systematic
evaluation of PRMs under diverse reasoning patterns and pave the way for future
development of PRMs.

Conclusion: ZeroGUI证明了无需人工干预的自动化GUI代理训练可行性，开源框架推动GUI智能体研究发展。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has propelled
the development of pure-vision-based GUI Agents, capable of perceiving and
operating Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) to autonomously fulfill user
instructions. However, existing approaches usually adopt an offline learning
framework, which faces two core limitations: (1) heavy reliance on high-quality
manual annotations for element grounding and action supervision, and (2)
limited adaptability to dynamic and interactive environments. To address these
limitations, we propose ZeroGUI, a scalable, online learning framework for
automating GUI Agent training at Zero human cost. Specifically, ZeroGUI
integrates (i) VLM-based automatic task generation to produce diverse training
goals from the current environment state, (ii) VLM-based automatic reward
estimation to assess task success without hand-crafted evaluation functions,
and (iii) two-stage online reinforcement learning to continuously interact with
and learn from GUI environments. Experiments on two advanced GUI Agents
(UI-TARS and Aguvis) demonstrate that ZeroGUI significantly boosts performance
across OSWorld and AndroidLab environments. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出基于对象轨迹的视频标记方法TrajViT，显著减少冗余令牌并提升多任务性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于时空补丁的视频标记方法产生冗余令牌且计算低效，在摄像机移动时尤其突出

Method: 提出grounded video tokenization范式，通过对象轨迹生成语义化令牌，开发TrajViT视频编码器

Result: 视频文本检索任务Top-5召回率提升6%（10倍令牌缩减），VideoQA任务平均提升5.2%（4倍训练速度，18倍推理FLOPs减少）

Conclusion: TrajViT成为首个在多样化视频任务中持续超越ViT3D的高效编码器，兼具鲁棒性和扩展性

Abstract: Effective video tokenization is critical for scaling transformer models for
long videos. Current approaches tokenize videos using space-time patches,
leading to excessive tokens and computational inefficiencies. The best token
reduction strategies degrade performance and barely reduce the number of tokens
when the camera moves. We introduce grounded video tokenization, a paradigm
that organizes tokens based on panoptic sub-object trajectories rather than
fixed patches. Our method aligns with fundamental perceptual principles,
ensuring that tokenization reflects scene complexity rather than video
duration. We propose TrajViT, a video encoder that extracts object trajectories
and converts them into semantically meaningful tokens, significantly reducing
redundancy while maintaining temporal coherence. Trained with contrastive
learning, TrajViT significantly outperforms space-time ViT (ViT3D) across
multiple video understanding benchmarks, e.g., TrajViT outperforms ViT3D by a
large margin of 6% top-5 recall in average at video-text retrieval task with
10x token deduction. We also show TrajViT as a stronger model than ViT3D for
being the video encoder for modern VideoLLM, obtaining an average of 5.2%
performance improvement across 6 VideoQA benchmarks while having 4x faster
training time and 18x less inference FLOPs. TrajViT is the first efficient
encoder to consistently outperform ViT3D across diverse video analysis tasks,
making it a robust and scalable solution.

Motivation: 传统舞蹈视频生成方法需要大量手动调整且效率低下。本文旨在通过自动化关键帧生成和优化算法，实现高效生成音乐同步、具备编舞对称性的动物舞蹈视频。

Method: 1. 使用文本到图像生成或GPT-4o创建关键动物姿态
2. 将舞蹈合成建模为图优化问题，自动匹配参考视频的节拍模式
3. 提出镜像姿态生成技术保持舞蹈对称性
4. 采用视频扩散模型生成中间帧

Result: 仅需6个输入关键帧即可生成长达30秒的多样化动物舞蹈视频，适配不同音乐曲目。

Conclusion: 该框架有效结合生成式AI与优化算法，显著降低舞蹈视频制作成本，为自动化内容生成提供新思路。

Abstract: We present a keyframe-based framework for generating music-synchronized,
choreography aware animal dance videos. Starting from a few keyframes
representing distinct animal poses -- generated via text-to-image prompting or
GPT-4o -- we formulate dance synthesis as a graph optimization problem: find
the optimal keyframe structure that satisfies a specified choreography pattern
of beats, which can be automatically estimated from a reference dance video. We
also introduce an approach for mirrored pose image generation, essential for
capturing symmetry in dance. In-between frames are synthesized using an video
diffusion model. With as few as six input keyframes, our method can produce up
to 30 second dance videos across a wide range of animals and music tracks.

TL;DR: 提出LayerPeeler方法，通过渐进剥离策略解决图像矢量化中遮挡区域问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具处理遮挡区域时产生不完整路径，基于规则和数据驱动的方法存在质量与灵活性限制

Method: 结合视觉语言模型构建图层关系图，采用自回归剥离策略逐层去除遮挡层，利用微调扩散模型实现精准区域去除

Result: 在路径完整性、几何规则性和视觉保真度上显著优于现有方法，贡献专用大规模数据集

Conclusion: LayerPeeler通过创新的剥离机制和局部注意力控制，实现了更高质量的层次化图像矢量化

Abstract: Image vectorization is a powerful technique that converts raster images into
vector graphics, enabling enhanced flexibility and interactivity. However,
popular image vectorization tools struggle with occluded regions, producing
incomplete or fragmented shapes that hinder editability. While recent
advancements have explored rule-based and data-driven layer-wise image
vectorization, these methods face limitations in vectorization quality and
flexibility. In this paper, we introduce LayerPeeler, a novel layer-wise image
vectorization approach that addresses these challenges through a progressive
simplification paradigm. The key to LayerPeeler's success lies in its
autoregressive peeling strategy: by identifying and removing the topmost
non-occluded layers while recovering underlying content, we generate vector
graphics with complete paths and coherent layer structures. Our method
leverages vision-language models to construct a layer graph that captures
occlusion relationships among elements, enabling precise detection and
description for non-occluded layers. These descriptive captions are used as
editing instructions for a finetuned image diffusion model to remove the
identified layers. To ensure accurate removal, we employ localized attention
control that precisely guides the model to target regions while faithfully
preserving the surrounding content. To support this, we contribute a
large-scale dataset specifically designed for layer peeling tasks. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that LayerPeeler
significantly outperforms existing techniques, producing vectorization results
with superior path semantics, geometric regularity, and visual fidelity.

Motivation: 现有细粒度视觉编码方法因长视觉标记序列导致计算开销剧增，传统剪枝策略（视觉编码器输出层/语言模型早期层）效果受限

Method: 1.视觉编码阶段整合全局扫描（token合并）与局部扫描（细粒度感知） 2.语言模型解码阶段引入中间层动态剪枝

Result: 在四个主流LVLM上验证：16个基准测试SOTA，LLaVA-NeXT-7B实现预填充加速2.91倍，计算量减少10倍，性能保留95.4%

Conclusion: VScan首次系统分析视觉标记处理全过程，通过多阶段互补策略实现更高效的视觉信息压缩，为实时多模态系统提供新方案

Abstract: Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have advanced multi-modal
understanding by incorporating finer-grained visual perception and encoding.
However, such methods incur significant computational costs due to longer
visual token sequences, posing challenges for real-time deployment. To mitigate
this, prior studies have explored pruning unimportant visual tokens either at
the output layer of the visual encoder or at the early layers of the language
model. In this work, we revisit these design choices and reassess their
effectiveness through comprehensive empirical studies of how visual tokens are
processed throughout the visual encoding and language decoding stages. Guided
by these insights, we propose VScan, a two-stage visual token reduction
framework that addresses token redundancy by: (1) integrating complementary
global and local scans with token merging during visual encoding, and (2)
introducing pruning at intermediate layers of the language model. Extensive
experimental results across four LVLMs validate the effectiveness of VScan in
accelerating inference and demonstrate its superior performance over current
state-of-the-arts on sixteen benchmarks. Notably, when applied to
LLaVA-NeXT-7B, VScan achieves a 2.91$\times$ speedup in prefilling and a
10$\times$ reduction in FLOPs, while retaining 95.4% of the original
performance.

Result: 建立涵盖五个核心文化维度的框架体系，为系统评估VLMs文化能力提供结构化方法论

Conclusion: 运用视觉文化研究的多维度框架是提升VLMs图像文化理解能力的必要路径

Abstract: Modern vision-language models (VLMs) often fail at cultural competency
evaluations and benchmarks. Given the diversity of applications built upon
VLMs, there is renewed interest in understanding how they encode cultural
nuances. While individual aspects of this problem have been studied, we still
lack a comprehensive framework for systematically identifying and annotating
the nuanced cultural dimensions present in images for VLMs. This position paper
argues that foundational methodologies from visual culture studies (cultural
studies, semiotics, and visual studies) are necessary for cultural analysis of
images. Building upon this review, we propose a set of five frameworks,
corresponding to cultural dimensions, that must be considered for a more
complete analysis of the cultural competencies of VLMs.

Conclusion: 首次发布匈牙利语文档VQA基准数据集与配套资源，为多语言文档理解研究提供基础设施

Abstract: Modern VLMs have achieved near-saturation accuracy in English document visual
question-answering (VQA). However, this task remains challenging in lower
resource languages due to a dearth of suitable training and evaluation data. In
this paper we present scalable methods for curating such datasets by focusing
on Hungarian, approximately the 17th highest resource language on the internet.
Specifically, we present HuDocVQA and HuDocVQA-manual, document VQA datasets
that modern VLMs significantly underperform on compared to English DocVQA.
HuDocVQA-manual is a small manually curated dataset based on Hungarian
documents from Common Crawl, while HuDocVQA is a larger synthetically generated
VQA data set from the same source. We apply multiple rounds of quality
filtering and deduplication to HuDocVQA in order to match human-level quality
in this dataset. We also present HuCCPDF, a dataset of 117k pages from
Hungarian Common Crawl PDFs along with their transcriptions, which can be used
for training a model for Hungarian OCR. To validate the quality of our
datasets, we show how finetuning on a mixture of these datasets can improve
accuracy on HuDocVQA for Llama 3.2 11B Instruct by +7.2%. Our datasets and code
will be released to the public to foster further research in multilingual

Motivation: 当前T2I模型虽能生成逼真图像，但缺乏处理时间推理、常识理解等复杂推理能力，且缺乏系统性评估体系

Method: 构建包含7类推理任务（常识/数学/逻辑等）的基准数据集，设计R2IScore评估指标（文本对齐/推理准确率/图像质量三维度QA评估）

Result: 测试16个主流模型（含基于LLM的解耦推理框架），结果显示所有模型在复杂推理任务中表现均未超过50%准确率

Conclusion: 需构建推理感知的新型T2I架构，将语言模型的推理能力与图像生成技术深度结合以突破现有瓶颈

Abstract: Reasoning is a fundamental capability often required in real-world
text-to-image (T2I) generation, e.g., generating ``a bitten apple that has been
left in the air for more than a week`` necessitates understanding temporal
decay and commonsense concepts. While recent T2I models have made impressive
progress in producing photorealistic images, their reasoning capability remains
underdeveloped and insufficiently evaluated. To bridge this gap, we introduce
R2I-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to rigorously assess
reasoning-driven T2I generation. R2I-Bench comprises meticulously curated data
instances, spanning core reasoning categories, including commonsense,
mathematical, logical, compositional, numerical, causal, and concept mixing. To
facilitate fine-grained evaluation, we design R2IScore, a QA-style metric based
on instance-specific, reasoning-oriented evaluation questions that assess three
critical dimensions: text-image alignment, reasoning accuracy, and image
quality. Extensive experiments with 16 representative T2I models, including a
strong pipeline-based framework that decouples reasoning and generation using
the state-of-the-art language and image generation models, demonstrate
consistently limited reasoning performance, highlighting the need for more
robust, reasoning-aware architectures in the next generation of T2I systems.

Abstract: The application of rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) to multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) introduces unique challenges and potential deviations
from findings in text-only domains, particularly for perception-heavy tasks.
This paper provides a comprehensive study of rule-based visual RL using jigsaw
puzzles as a structured experimental framework, revealing several key findings.
\textit{Firstly,} we find that MLLMs, initially performing near to random
guessing on simple puzzles, achieve near-perfect accuracy and generalize to
complex, unseen configurations through fine-tuning. \textit{Secondly,} training
on jigsaw puzzles can induce generalization to other visual tasks, with
effectiveness tied to specific task configurations. \textit{Thirdly,} MLLMs can
learn and generalize with or without explicit reasoning, though open-source
models often favor direct answering. Consequently, even when trained for
step-by-step reasoning, they can ignore the thinking process in deriving the
final answer. \textit{Fourthly,} we observe that complex reasoning patterns
appear to be pre-existing rather than emergent, with their frequency increasing
alongside training and task difficulty. \textit{Finally,} our results
demonstrate that RL exhibits more effective generalization than Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT), and an initial SFT cold start phase can hinder subsequent RL
optimization. Although these observations are based on jigsaw puzzles and may
vary across other visual tasks, this research contributes a valuable piece of
jigsaw to the larger puzzle of collective understanding rule-based visual RL
and its potential in multimodal learning. The code is available at:

Method: 设计包含连贯性验证、错误感知、错误检测和推理评估的四维评测体系，测试13个前沿模型，并通过RePrompt实验探索模型反馈对视频生成的实际优化效果

Result: 最佳模型GPT-4.1各任务表现不均衡（平均准确率仅64.7%），揭示评估挑战性；RePrompt实验使视频生成质量提升23.6%

Conclusion: VF-Eval填补AIGC视频评估空白，证明当前MLLMs存在能力局限，同时验证模型对齐人类反馈对生成系统的改进潜力

Abstract: MLLMs have been widely studied for video question answering recently.
However, most existing assessments focus on natural videos, overlooking
synthetic videos, such as AI-generated content (AIGC). Meanwhile, some works in
video generation rely on MLLMs to evaluate the quality of generated videos, but
the capabilities of MLLMs on interpreting AIGC videos remain largely
underexplored. To address this, we propose a new benchmark, VF-Eval, which
introduces four tasks-coherence validation, error awareness, error type
detection, and reasoning evaluation-to comprehensively evaluate the abilities
of MLLMs on AIGC videos. We evaluate 13 frontier MLLMs on VF-Eval and find that
even the best-performing model, GPT-4.1, struggles to achieve consistently good
performance across all tasks. This highlights the challenging nature of our
benchmark. Additionally, to investigate the practical applications of VF-Eval
in improving video generation, we conduct an experiment, RePrompt,
demonstrating that aligning MLLMs more closely with human feedback can benefit
video generation.

Abstract: Spatial intelligence is essential for multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) operating in the complex physical world. Existing benchmarks, however,
probe only single-image relations and thus fail to assess the multi-image
spatial reasoning that real-world deployments demand. We introduce MMSI-Bench,
a VQA benchmark dedicated to multi-image spatial intelligence. Six 3D-vision
researchers spent more than 300 hours meticulously crafting 1,000 challenging,
unambiguous multiple-choice questions from over 120,000 images, each paired
with carefully designed distractors and a step-by-step reasoning process. We
conduct extensive experiments and thoroughly evaluate 34 open-source and
proprietary MLLMs, observing a wide gap: the strongest open-source model
attains roughly 30% accuracy and OpenAI's o3 reasoning model reaches 40%, while
humans score 97%. These results underscore the challenging nature of MMSI-Bench
and the substantial headroom for future research. Leveraging the annotated
reasoning processes, we also provide an automated error analysis pipeline that
diagnoses four dominant failure modes, including (1) grounding errors, (2)
overlap-matching and scene-reconstruction errors, (3) situation-transformation
reasoning errors, and (4) spatial-logic errors, offering valuable insights for

Method: 构建权重条件策略覆盖帕累托前沿，支持训练后权重动态调整，并探索分层策略动态选择权重机制。

Result: 实现机器人高动态运动控制，多目标策略编码多样化行为，任务适应效率提升3倍。

Conclusion: 该框架显著缩短强化学习迭代周期，为复杂机器人任务提供高效适配解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly advanced the control of
physics-based and robotic characters that track kinematic reference motion.
However, methods typically rely on a weighted sum of conflicting reward
functions, requiring extensive tuning to achieve a desired behavior. Due to the
computational cost of RL, this iterative process is a tedious, time-intensive
task. Furthermore, for robotics applications, the weights need to be chosen
such that the policy performs well in the real world, despite inevitable
sim-to-real gaps. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-objective
reinforcement learning framework that trains a single policy conditioned on a
set of weights, spanning the Pareto front of reward trade-offs. Within this
framework, weights can be selected and tuned after training, significantly
speeding up iteration time. We demonstrate how this improved workflow can be
used to perform highly dynamic motions with a robot character. Moreover, we
explore how weight-conditioned policies can be leveraged in hierarchical
settings, using a high-level policy to dynamically select weights according to
the current task. We show that the multi-objective policy encodes a diverse
spectrum of behaviors, facilitating efficient adaptation to novel tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为商业鼻音检测设备提供灵活且经济有效的开源替代方案

Method: 1. 设计开源硬件系统 2. 与商业设备进行鼻音分数对比 3. 测试不同麦克风和材料的性能

Result: Nosey鼻音分数更高，但不同发音环境下的对比幅度与商业系统相当

Conclusion: Nosey是有效的商业设备替代方案，需注意标准化测试条件和设备校准

Abstract: We introduce Nosey (Nasalance Open Source Estimation sYstem), a low-cost,
customizable, 3D-printed system for recording acoustic nasalance data that we
have made available as open-source hardware
(http://github.com/phoneticslab/nosey). We first outline the motivations and
design principles behind our hardware nasalance system, and then present a
comparison between Nosey and a commercial nasalance device. Nosey shows
consistently higher nasalance scores than the commercial device, but the
magnitude of contrast between phonological environments is comparable between
systems. We also review ways of customizing the hardware to facilitate testing,
such as comparison of microphones and different construction materials. We
conclude that Nosey is a flexible and cost-effective alternative to commercial
nasometry devices and propose some methodological considerations for its use in
data collection.

TL;DR: 研究通过几何框架预测HMD渲染误差导致的视觉距离偏差，实验验证误差影响并提出实时视觉反馈校准方案


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决头戴显示器因渲染相机位置错误和用户观察位置偏差导致的深度感知失真问题，提升虚拟现实体验准确性

Method: 开发几何预测框架，构建Quest3眼动追踪实验平台，设计五组验证实验并引入实时视觉反馈机制

Result: 证实几何误差会引起距离感知高估/低估，证明视觉反馈可动态校准视觉运动映射实现准确操作

Conclusion: HMD几何误差显著影响空间感知，但可通过实时反馈机制补偿，为改进虚拟现实显示技术提供理论依据

Abstract: Stereoscopic head-mounted displays (HMDs) render and present binocular images
to create an egocentric, 3D percept to the HMD user. Within this render and
presentation pipeline there are potential rendering camera and viewing position
errors that can induce deviations in the depth and distance that a user
perceives compared to the underlying intended geometry. For example, rendering
errors can arise when HMD render cameras are incorrectly positioned relative to
the assumed centers of projections of the HMD displays and viewing errors can
arise when users view stereo geometry from the incorrect location in the HMD
eyebox. In this work we present a geometric framework that predicts errors in
distance perception arising from inaccurate HMD perspective geometry and build
an HMD platform to reliably simulate render and viewing error in a Quest 3 HMD
with eye tracking to experimentally test these predictions. We present a series
of five experiments to explore the efficacy of this geometric framework and
show that errors in perspective geometry can induce both under- and
over-estimations in perceived distance. We further demonstrate how real-time
visual feedback can be used to dynamically recalibrate visuomotor mapping so
that an accurate reach distance is achieved even if the perceived visual
distance is negatively impacted by geometric error.

Result: 相比原始论文基准分数，MAE和RMSE获得显著提升，代码已在GitHub开源

Conclusion: 多模态数据与领域知识融合有效提升检测精度，为LLMs在精神健康诊断中的应用提供新方向

Abstract: Depression is a growing concern gaining attention in both public discourse
and AI research. While deep neural networks (DNNs) have been used for
recognition, they still lack real-world effectiveness. Large language models
(LLMs) show strong potential but require domain-specific fine-tuning and
struggle with non-textual cues. Since depression is often expressed through
vocal tone and behaviour rather than explicit text, relying on language alone
is insufficient. Diagnostic accuracy also suffers without incorporating
psychological expertise. To address these limitations, we present, to the best
of our knowledge, the first application of LLMs to multimodal depression
detection using the DAIC-WOZ dataset. We extract the audio features using the
pre-trained model Wav2Vec, and mapped it to text-based LLMs for further
processing. We also propose a novel strategy for incorporating psychological
knowledge into LLMs to enhance diagnostic performance, specifically using a
question and answer set to grant authorised knowledge to LLMs. Our approach
yields a notable improvement in both Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean
Square Error (RMSE) compared to a base score proposed by the related original
paper. The codes are available at

Motivation: 标准化问卷无法反映特殊教育学生真实心理状态，现有自动化方法缺乏教师共情带来的个体化洞察

Method: 开发Human Empathy as Encoder (HEAE)，将PHQ-9框架指导的教师共情向量结构化，通过多模态融合优化分类架构

Result: 7级抑郁严重程度分类准确率82.74%，验证了人机协同在情感计算中的有效性

Conclusion: 通过结构化嵌入人类共情，开辟了更负责任的情感计算路径，实现AI增强而非替代人类判断的伦理框架

Abstract: Assessing student depression in sensitive environments like special education
is challenging. Standardized questionnaires may not fully reflect students'
true situations. Furthermore, automated methods often falter with rich student
narratives, lacking the crucial, individualized insights stemming from
teachers' empathetic connections with students. Existing methods often fail to
address this ambiguity or effectively integrate educator understanding. To
address these limitations by fostering a synergistic human-AI collaboration,
this paper introduces Human Empathy as Encoder (HEAE), a novel, human-centered
AI framework for transparent and socially responsible depression severity
assessment. Our approach uniquely integrates student narrative text with a
teacher-derived, 9-dimensional "Empathy Vector" (EV), its dimensions guided by
the PHQ-9 framework,to explicitly translate tacit empathetic insight into a
structured AI input enhancing rather than replacing human judgment. Rigorous
experiments optimized the multimodal fusion, text representation, and
classification architecture, achieving 82.74% accuracy for 7-level severity
classification. This work demonstrates a path toward more responsible and
ethical affective computing by structurally embedding human empathy

Result: 发现现有LLM在语境建模、动态更新和元认知能力方面存在架构性限制，无法实现完全语境对齐

Conclusion: 提出开发者需通过该框架系统评估设计选择，建议未来研究需突破当前LLM的单向序列处理范式

Abstract: The development of sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) conversational
agents based on large language models raises important questions about the
relationship between human norms, values, and practices and AI design and
performance. This article explores what it means for AI agents to be
conversationally aligned to human communicative norms and practices for
handling context and common ground and proposes a new framework for evaluating
developers' design choices. We begin by drawing on the philosophical and
linguistic literature on conversational pragmatics to motivate a set of
desiderata, which we call the CONTEXT-ALIGN framework, for conversational
alignment with human communicative practices. We then suggest that current
large language model (LLM) architectures, constraints, and affordances may
impose fundamental limitations on achieving full conversational alignment.

Result: 在AgentHarm基准测试中模型安全性提升35.8%-79.5%，实用性未受显著影响甚至提升，超越多种提示方法

Conclusion: 基于行为链的数据合成方法能有效实现安全对齐，框架通过开源数据集验证了安全与效用的平衡

Abstract: The acquisition of agentic capabilities has transformed LLMs from "knowledge
providers" to "action executors", a trend that while expanding LLMs' capability
boundaries, significantly increases their susceptibility to malicious use.
Previous work has shown that current LLM-based agents execute numerous
malicious tasks even without being attacked, indicating a deficiency in agentic
use safety alignment during the post-training phase. To address this gap, we
propose AgentAlign, a novel framework that leverages abstract behavior chains
as a medium for safety alignment data synthesis. By instantiating these
behavior chains in simulated environments with diverse tool instances, our
framework enables the generation of highly authentic and executable
instructions while capturing complex multi-step dynamics. The framework further
ensures model utility by proportionally synthesizing benign instructions
through non-malicious interpretations of behavior chains, precisely calibrating
the boundary between helpfulness and harmlessness. Evaluation results on
AgentHarm demonstrate that fine-tuning three families of open-source models
using our method substantially improves their safety (35.8% to 79.5%
improvement) while minimally impacting or even positively enhancing their
helpfulness, outperforming various prompting methods. The dataset and code have
both been open-sourced.

Abstract: The size and compute characteristics of modern large language models have led
to an increased interest in developing specialized kernels tailored for

However, low-batch inference, where memory bandwidth and kernel launch
overheads contribute are significant factors, remains important for many
applications of interest such as in edge deployment and latency-sensitive
applications. This paper describes FlashFormer, a proof-of-concept kernel for
accelerating single-batch inference for transformer-based large language

Result: 在LLaMA3-70B模型2:4半结构化稀疏下，困惑度差距降低58%（8.1→3.4），多模型实验显示一致性能提升。

Conclusion: 通过参数分布优化而非单纯剪枝选择，DenoiseRotator实现了更鲁棒的模型压缩，且无需修改现有剪枝流程。

Abstract: Pruning is a widely used technique to compress large language models (LLMs)
by removing unimportant weights, but it often suffers from significant
performance degradation - especially under semi-structured sparsity
constraints. Existing pruning methods primarily focus on estimating the
importance of individual weights, which limits their ability to preserve
critical capabilities of the model. In this work, we propose a new perspective:
rather than merely selecting which weights to prune, we first redistribute
parameter importance to make the model inherently more amenable to pruning. By
minimizing the information entropy of normalized importance scores, our
approach concentrates importance onto a smaller subset of weights, thereby
enhancing pruning robustness. We instantiate this idea through DenoiseRotator,
which applies learnable orthogonal transformations to the model's weight
matrices. Our method is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated with
existing pruning techniques such as Magnitude, SparseGPT, and Wanda. Evaluated
on LLaMA3, Qwen2.5, and Mistral models under 50% unstructured and 2:4
semi-structured sparsity, DenoiseRotator consistently improves perplexity and
zero-shot accuracy. For instance, on LLaMA3-70B pruned with SparseGPT at 2:4
semi-structured sparsity, DenoiseRotator reduces the perplexity gap to the
dense model by 58%, narrowing the degradation from 8.1 to 3.4 points. Codes are

Motivation: 现有PEFT方法（如DoRA）在权重方向调整上缺乏严谨的几何学基础，仅通过列级启发式定义方向，限制了模型的适应能力和解释性。

Method: 1. 对预训练权重进行归一化处理
2. 学习高维向量空间中的方向更新

Conclusion: MAP为PEFT方法提供了方向-幅度解耦的通用范式，其简洁性和有效性可能成为未来参数高效微调技术的标准配置

Abstract: The rapid development of large language models has revolutionized natural
language processing, but their fine-tuning remains computationally expensive,
hindering broad deployment. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods,
such as LoRA, have emerged as solutions. Recent work like DoRA attempts to
further decompose weight adaptation into direction and magnitude components.
However, existing formulations often define direction heuristically at the
column level, lacking a principled geometric foundation. In this paper, we
propose MAP, a novel framework that reformulates weight matrices as
high-dimensional vectors and decouples their adaptation into direction and
magnitude in a rigorous manner. MAP normalizes the pre-trained weights, learns
a directional update, and introduces two scalar coefficients to independently
scale the magnitude of the base and update vectors. This design enables more
interpretable and flexible adaptation, and can be seamlessly integrated into
existing PEFT methods. Extensive experiments show that MAP significantly
improves performance when coupling with existing methods, offering a simple yet
powerful enhancement to existing PEFT methods. Given the universality and
simplicity of MAP, we hope it can serve as a default setting for designing
future PEFT methods.

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
advancements, drawing significant attention from the research community. Their
capabilities are largely attributed to large-scale architectures, which require
extensive training on massive datasets. However, such datasets often contain
sensitive or copyrighted content sourced from the public internet, raising
concerns about data privacy and ownership. Regulatory frameworks, such as the
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), grant individuals the right to
request the removal of such sensitive information. This has motivated the
development of machine unlearning algorithms that aim to remove specific
knowledge from models without the need for costly retraining. Despite these
advancements, evaluating the efficacy of unlearning algorithms remains a
challenge due to the inherent complexity and generative nature of LLMs. In this
work, we introduce a comprehensive auditing framework for unlearning
evaluation, comprising three benchmark datasets, six unlearning algorithms, and
five prompt-based auditing methods. By using various auditing algorithms, we
evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of different unlearning strategies.
To explore alternatives beyond prompt-based auditing, we propose a novel
technique that leverages intermediate activation perturbations, addressing the
limitations of auditing methods that rely solely on model inputs and outputs.

Conclusion: 定制化的正则化设计能有效提升知识图谱补全性能，基于排序的稀疏策略可精准抑制噪声特征，为模型优化提供新思路。

Abstract: Knowledge graph completion (KGC) has attracted considerable attention in
recent years because it is critical to improving the quality of knowledge
graphs. Researchers have continuously explored various models. However, most
previous efforts have neglected to take advantage of regularization from a
deeper perspective and therefore have not been used to their full potential.
This paper rethinks the application of regularization methods in KGC. Through
extensive empirical studies on various KGC models, we find that carefully
designed regularization not only alleviates overfitting and reduces variance
but also enables these models to break through the upper bounds of their
original performance. Furthermore, we introduce a novel sparse-regularization
method that embeds the concept of rank-based selective sparsity into the KGC
regularizer. The core idea is to selectively penalize those components with
significant features in the embedding vector, thus effectively ignoring many
components that contribute little and may only represent noise. Various
comparative experiments on multiple datasets and multiple models show that the
SPR regularization method is better than other regularization methods and can
enable the KGC model to further break through the performance margin.

Conclusion: tnLLM框架在TN-SS问题中实现高效搜索与可解释性，验证了LLM整合领域知识优化传统算法的潜力。

Abstract: Tensor networks (TNs) provide efficient representations of high-dimensional
data, yet identification of the optimal TN structures, the so called tensor
network structure search (TN-SS) problem, remains a challenge. Current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms are computationally expensive as they
require extensive function evaluations, which is prohibitive for real-world
applications. In addition, existing methods ignore valuable domain information
inherent in real-world tensor data and lack transparency in their identified TN
structures. To this end, we propose a novel TN-SS framework, termed the tnLLM,
which incorporates domain information about the data and harnesses the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to directly predict
suitable TN structures. The proposed framework involves a domain-aware
prompting pipeline which instructs the LLM to infer suitable TN structures
based on the real-world relationships between tensor modes. In this way, our
approach is capable of not only iteratively optimizing the objective function,
but also generating domain-aware explanations for the identified structures.
Experimental results demonstrate that tnLLM achieves comparable TN-SS objective
function values with much fewer function evaluations compared to SOTA
algorithms. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the LLM-enabled domain information
can be used to find good initializations in the search space for sampling-based
SOTA methods to accelerate their convergence while preserving theoretical
performance guarantees.

Method: SPO框架包含三个创新组件：1）基于cutpoint/tree的灵活段划分策略 2）基于蒙特卡洛的段级优势估计方法 3）采用概率掩码策略的段优势策略优化

Conclusion: SPO通过中间粒度的段级优势估计有效平衡信用分配精度与计算效率，适用于短/长思维链场景，且无需critic模型即可实现准确估计

Abstract: Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models effectively
using reinforcement learning (RL) remains a crucial challenge. Existing
approaches primarily adopt two contrasting advantage estimation granularities:
Token-level methods (e.g., PPO) aim to provide the fine-grained advantage
signals but suffer from inaccurate estimation due to difficulties in training
an accurate critic model. On the other extreme, trajectory-level methods (e.g.,
GRPO) solely rely on a coarse-grained advantage signal from the final reward,
leading to imprecise credit assignment. To address these limitations, we
propose Segment Policy Optimization (SPO), a novel RL framework that leverages
segment-level advantage estimation at an intermediate granularity, achieving a
better balance by offering more precise credit assignment than trajectory-level
methods and requiring fewer estimation points than token-level methods,
enabling accurate advantage estimation based on Monte Carlo (MC) without a
critic model. SPO features three components with novel strategies: (1) flexible
segment partition; (2) accurate segment advantage estimation; and (3) policy
optimization using segment advantages, including a novel probability-mask
strategy. We further instantiate SPO for two specific scenarios: (1) SPO-chain
for short chain-of-thought (CoT), featuring novel cutpoint-based partition and
chain-based advantage estimation, achieving $6$-$12$ percentage point
improvements in accuracy over PPO and GRPO on GSM8K. (2) SPO-tree for long CoT,
featuring novel tree-based advantage estimation, which significantly reduces
the cost of MC estimation, achieving $7$-$11$ percentage point improvements
over GRPO on MATH500 under 2K and 4K context evaluation. We make our code
publicly available at https://github.com/AIFrameResearch/SPO.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms are fundamental to align large language
models with human preferences and to enhance their reasoning capabilities.
However, current reinforcement learning algorithms often suffer from training
instability due to loose on-policy constraints and computational inefficiency
due to auxiliary models. In this work, we propose On-Policy RL with Optimal
reward baseline (OPO), a novel and simplified reinforcement learning algorithm
designed to address these challenges. OPO emphasizes the importance of exact
on-policy training, which empirically stabilizes the training process and
enhances exploration. Moreover, OPO introduces the optimal reward baseline that
theoretically minimizes gradient variance. We evaluate OPO on mathematical
reasoning benchmarks. The results demonstrate its superior performance and
training stability without additional models or regularization terms.
Furthermore, OPO achieves lower policy shifts and higher output entropy,
encouraging more diverse and less repetitive responses. These results highlight
OPO as a promising direction for stable and effective reinforcement learning in
large language model alignment and reasoning tasks. The implementation is
provided at https://github.com/microsoft/LMOps/tree/main/opo.

Conclusion: 通过差分信息视角统一解释了DPO目标函数、偏好数据结构与策略行为的关系，为偏好优化提供了新的理论框架

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a standard technique for
aligning language models with human preferences in a supervised manner. Despite
its empirical success, the theoretical justification behind its log-ratio
reward parameterization remains incomplete. In this work, we address this gap
by utilizing the Differential Information Distribution (DID): a distribution
over token sequences that captures the information gained during policy
updates. First, we show that when preference labels encode the differential
information required to transform a reference policy into a target policy, the
log-ratio reward in DPO emerges as the uniquely optimal form for learning the
target policy via preference optimization. This result naturally yields a
closed-form expression for the optimal sampling distribution over rejected
responses. Second, we find that the condition for preferences to encode
differential information is fundamentally linked to an implicit assumption
regarding log-margin ordered policies-an inductive bias widely used in
preference optimization yet previously unrecognized. Finally, by analyzing the
entropy of the DID, we characterize how learning low-entropy differential
information reinforces the policy distribution, while high-entropy differential
information induces a smoothing effect, which explains the log-likelihood
displacement phenomenon. We validate our theoretical findings in synthetic
experiments and extend them to real-world instruction-following datasets. Our
results suggest that learning high-entropy differential information is crucial
for general instruction-following, while learning low-entropy differential
information benefits knowledge-intensive question answering. Overall, our work
presents a unifying perspective on the DPO objective, the structure of
preference data, and resulting policy behaviors through the lens of
differential information.

*Vladimir Bataev,Andrei Andrusenko,Lilit Grigoryan,Aleksandr Laptev,Vitaly Lavrukhin,Boris Ginsburg*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 提出NGPU-LM方法优化统计n-gram语言模型在GPU上的并行计算效率，适用于主流ASR模型类型，计算开销低于7%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有统计n-gram模型在GPU上并行效率不足，影响工业场景上下文偏置应用效果。

Method: 重构n-gram模型数据结构实现GPU加速推理，支持transducer/attention encoder-decoder/CTC等模型的自定义贪婪解码。

Result: 在域外场景缩小贪婪搜索与束搜索精度差距50%以上，避免束搜索的显著延迟，代码已开源。

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡计算效率与识别精度，推动上下文偏置技术在工业ASR系统的实际应用。

Abstract: Statistical n-gram language models are widely used for context-biasing tasks
in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). However, existing implementations lack
computational efficiency due to poor parallelization, making context-biasing
less appealing for industrial use. This work rethinks data structures for
statistical n-gram language models to enable fast and parallel operations for
GPU-optimized inference. Our approach, named NGPU-LM, introduces customizable
greedy decoding for all major ASR model types - including transducers,
attention encoder-decoder models, and CTC - with less than 7% computational
overhead. The proposed approach can eliminate more than 50% of the accuracy gap
between greedy and beam search for out-of-domain scenarios while avoiding
significant slowdown caused by beam search. The implementation of the proposed
NGPU-LM is open-sourced.

TL;DR: 提出动态更新的SWE-bench-Live基准测试，解决现有静态基准的更新延迟、覆盖局限和人工依赖问题，通过自动化流程实现持续更新的软件工程评估体系


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SWE-bench存在三大局限：1) 数据集陈旧未更新 2) 覆盖仓库范围狭窄 3) 人工构建导致可扩展性差且易过拟合，需要建立动态可持续的评估基准

Method: 开发自动化流程method：1) 从GitHub实时抓取2024年后新建的1,319个issue构建任务集 2) 为每个任务创建独立Docker镜像 3) 实现从实例生成到环境配置的全流程自动化

Result: 实验显示当前SOTA模型在动态基准上的表现显著落后于静态基准（即使受控条件下），揭示模型在动态真实环境中的适应性不足

Conclusion: SWE-bench-Live通过实时数据源+自动化架构，为LLM提供抗数据污染的动态评估场景，推动智能体在真实软件开发环境中的能力验证

Abstract: The issue-resolving task, where a model generates patches to fix real-world
bugs, has emerged as a critical benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of
large language models (LLMs). While SWE-bench and its variants have become
standard in this domain, they suffer from key limitations: they have not been
updated since their initial releases, cover a narrow set of repositories, and
depend heavily on manual effort for instance construction and environment
setup. These factors hinder scalability and introduce risks of overfitting and
data contamination. In this work, we present \textbf{SWE-bench-Live}, a
\textit{live-updatable} benchmark designed to overcome these challenges. Our
initial release consists of 1,319 tasks derived from real GitHub issues created
since 2024, spanning 93 repositories. Each task is accompanied by a dedicated
Docker image to ensure reproducible execution. Central to our benchmark is
\method, an automated curation pipeline that streamlines the entire process
from instance creation to environment setup, removing manual bottlenecks and
enabling scalability and continuous updates. We evaluate a range of
state-of-the-art agent frameworks and LLMs on SWE-bench-Live, revealing a
substantial performance gap compared to static benchmarks like SWE-bench, even
under controlled evaluation conditions. To better understand this discrepancy,
we perform detailed analyses across repository origin, issue recency, and task
difficulty. By providing a fresh, diverse, and executable benchmark grounded in
live repository activity, SWE-bench-Live facilitates rigorous,
contamination-resistant evaluation of LLMs and agents in dynamic, real-world
software development settings.

TL;DR: 评估指令调优大语言模型在生命科学软件元数据身份解析任务中的表现，并提出基于协议的高置信度自动化决策方案


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究软件在科研中日益重要但关注不足，不同平台的元数据质量参差不齐，需建立整合机制支持软件可持续发展

Method: 使用多平台结构化元数据，通过人工标注黄金标准对模型进行基准测试，设计基于协议置信度的代理决策方案

Result: 代理方案实现高精度（>95%）和统计稳健性，同时揭示当前模型在跨注册语义判断中的泛化局限性

Conclusion: 需平衡自动化效率与人工验证，强调FAIR原则下元数据语义整合在生命科学软件可持续发展中的关键作用

Abstract: Software is an essential component of research. However, little attention has
been paid to it compared with that paid to research data. Recently, there has
been an increase in efforts to acknowledge and highlight the importance of
software in research activities.
  Structured metadata from platforms like bio.tools, Bioconductor, and Galaxy
ToolShed offers valuable insights into research software in the Life Sciences.
Although originally intended to support discovery and integration, this
metadata can be repurposed for large-scale analysis of software practices.
However, its quality and completeness vary across platforms, reflecting diverse
documentation practices.
  To gain a comprehensive view of software development and sustainability,
consolidating this metadata is necessary, but requires robust mechanisms to
address its heterogeneity and scale.
  This article presents an evaluation of instruction-tuned large language
models for the task of software metadata identity resolution, a critical step
in assembling a cohesive collection of research software. Such a collection is
the reference component for the Software Observatory at OpenEBench, a platform
that aggregates metadata to monitor the FAIRness of research software in the
Life Sciences.
  We benchmarked multiple models against a human-annotated gold standard,
examined their behavior on ambiguous cases, and introduced an agreement-based
proxy for high-confidence automated decisions. The proxy achieved high
precision and statistical robustness, while also highlighting the limitations
of current models and the broader challenges of automating semantic judgment in
FAIR-aligned software metadata across registries and repositories.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发高性能软件需要专业知识，现有语言模型在此领域表现不足，需建立评估基准推动相关技术发展

Method: 通过自动化管道生成性能测试，分析代码库提交历史筛选102个优化任务，覆盖10个代码库的多个领域和语言，以专家优化为基准测量运行效率改进

Result: 主流SWE-Agents成功率低于5%，推理扩展提升有限；定性分析显示失败主因包括低级语言处理困难、优化策略惰性及瓶颈定位不准

Conclusion: 当前代理在软件优化任务中表现显著不足，公开代码和实验轨迹促进未来研究

Abstract: Developing high-performance software is a complex task that requires
specialized expertise. We introduce GSO, a benchmark for evaluating language
models' capabilities in developing high-performance software. We develop an
automated pipeline that generates and executes performance tests to analyze
repository commit histories to identify 102 challenging optimization tasks
across 10 codebases, spanning diverse domains and programming languages. An
agent is provided with a codebase and performance test as a precise
specification, and tasked to improve the runtime efficiency, which is measured
against the expert developer optimization. Our quantitative evaluation reveals
that leading SWE-Agents struggle significantly, achieving less than 5% success
rate, with limited improvements even with inference-time scaling. Our
qualitative analysis identifies key failure modes, including difficulties with
low-level languages, practicing lazy optimization strategies, and challenges in
accurately localizing bottlenecks. We release the code and artifacts of our
benchmark along with agent trajectories to enable future research.

TL;DR: TailorSQL利用历史SQL查询信息提升自然语言转SQL的准确率和效率，在基准测试中执行准确率提升2倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NL2SQL技术未充分利用真实数据库环境中积累的历史查询信息（如常见关联路径、模糊表名/列名的语义），存在优化空间。

Method: 提出TailorSQL系统，通过分析历史查询负载，提取隐含的数据库使用模式特征，增强模型对特定场景的适应性。

Result: 在标准化测试中实现最高2倍的执行准确率提升，同时降低翻译延迟。

Conclusion: 利用历史查询负载信息是优化NL2SQL任务的有效途径，可为实际数据库应用提供更精准、高效的语义解析能力。

Abstract: NL2SQL (natural language to SQL) translates natural language questions into
SQL queries, thereby making structured data accessible to non-technical users,
serving as the foundation for intelligent data applications. State-of-the-art
NL2SQL techniques typically perform translation by retrieving database-specific
information, such as the database schema, and invoking a pre-trained large
language model (LLM) using the question and retrieved information to generate
the SQL query.
  However, existing NL2SQL techniques miss a key opportunity which is present
in real-world settings: NL2SQL is typically applied on existing databases which
have already served many SQL queries in the past. The past query workload
implicitly contains information which is helpful for accurate NL2SQL
translation and is not apparent from the database schema alone, such as common
join paths and the semantics of obscurely-named tables and columns. We
introduce TailorSQL, a NL2SQL system that takes advantage of information in the
past query workload to improve both the accuracy and latency of translating
natural language questions into SQL. By specializing to a given workload,
TailorSQL achieves up to 2$\times$ improvement in execution accuracy on
standardized benchmarks.
