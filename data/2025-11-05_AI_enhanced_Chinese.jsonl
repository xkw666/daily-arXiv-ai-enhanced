Next, we present adaptive query augmentation.\nThrough this step, M-Solomon can conduct query augmentation only when necessary\nby learning to generate synthetic augmentations with the prefix /augment for\nqueries that demand them and to generate the simple string /embed for others.\nExperimental results showed that M-Solomon not only surpassed the baseline\nwithout augmentation by a large margin but also outperformed the baseline that\nalways used augmentation, providing much faster embedding latency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faM-Solomon\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u67e5\u8be2\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5728\u51cf\u5c1147%\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM-based\u67e5\u8be2\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5168\u91cf\u589e\u5f3a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u90e8\u5206\u67e5\u8be2\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u3002\u9700\u8981\u52a8\u6001\u51b3\u7b56\u4f55\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u67e5\u8be2\u589e\u5f3a\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "1. \u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u5c42\u7ea7\u5212\u5206\u9700/\u65e0\u9700\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u7ec4 2. \u5229\u7528MLLM\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u589e\u5f3a 3. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u751f\u6210/augment\u524d\u7f00\u89e6\u53d1\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c/embed\u524d\u7f00\u76f4\u63a5\u5d4c\u5165\u3002", "result": "M-Solomon\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u68c0\u7d22\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5d4c\u5165\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e47%\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u5168\u91cf\u589e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff08+12.3% MRR\uff09\u548c\u65e0\u589e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff08+21.5% MRR\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u67e5\u8be2\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff0cM-Solomon\u4e3a\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Merging domain-specific Continual Pre-training\n(CPT) \"experts\" offers a practical alternative to costly and unstable\nmulti-skill training. However, unlike established Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)\nmodel-based merging, CPT model merging remains largely unexplored. We address\nthis gap by creating financial LLMs from experts in finance, math, and\nJapanese. We propose a three-stage evaluation focusing on knowledge recovery,\ncomplementarity, and emergence, and assess three merging methods (Task\nArithmetic, TIES, and DARE-TIES) on a comprehensive financial benchmark curated\nfrom 18 tasks across 8 established datasets. Results show that merging an\nexpert with its base model recovers general knowledge lost during CPT, while\nmerging experts improves performance and can yield emergent cross-domain\nskills.

The Knowledge\nTracing (KT) task aims to predict how students will respond to educational\nquestions in learning environments, based on their prior interactions. Existing\nKT models typically use response correctness along with metadata like skill\ntags and timestamps, often overlooking the question text, which is an important\nsource of pedagogical insight. This omission poses a lost opportunity while\nlimiting predictive performance. We propose Next Token Knowledge Tracing\n(NTKT), a novel approach that reframes KT as a next-token prediction task using\npretrained Large Language Models (LLMs).

However, their enormous size limits storage and processing\ncapabilities to a few well-resourced stakeholders. As a result, most\napplications rely on pre-trained LLMs, fine-tuned for specific tasks. However,\neven storing the fine-tuned versions of these models remains a significant\nchallenge due to the wide range of tasks they address. Recently, studies show\nthat fine-tuning these models primarily affects a small fraction of parameters,\nhighlighting the need for more efficient storage of fine-tuned models. This\npaper focuses on efficient storage of parameter updates in pre-trained models\nafter fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we leverage the observation that\nfine-tuning updates are both low-rank and sparse, which can be utilized for\nstorage efficiency. However, using only low-rank approximation or\nsparsification may discard critical singular components that enhance model\nexpressivity.

Specifically, multi-context GRPO samples groups of\ntrajectories under different contexts and propagates trajectory-level\nadvantages across all conversations within them. Trained on the same dataset as\nSearch-R1, MemSearcher achieves significant improvements over strong baselines\non seven public benchmarks: +11% on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and +12% on\nQwen2.5-7B-Instruct relative average gains. Notably, the 3B-based MemSearcher\neven outperforms 7B-based baselines, demonstrating that striking a balance\nbetween information integrity and efficiency yields both higher accuracy and\nlower computational overhead.

More\nspecifically, CudaForge employs two LLM agents: a Coder and a Judge, that\niteratively generate, correct, and optimize CUDA kernels, while integrating\nhardware feedback such as Nsight Compute (NCU) metrics. In extensive\nevaluations, we show that CudaForge, by leveraging base models like OpenAI-o3,\nachieves 97.6\\% correctness of generated kernels and an average 1.68$\\times$\nspeedup over PyTorch baselines, substantially surpassing state-of-the-art\nmodels including OpenAI-o3 and Kevin on KernelBench. Beyond accuracy and speed,\nCudaForge demonstrates strong generalization across GPUs (A100, RTX 6000, 4090,\n3090) and base models (OpenAI-o3, GPT-5, gpt-oss-120B, Claude-Sonnet-4,\nQwQ-32B), while maintaining high efficiency.

Despite\npromising performance, we identify a critical limitation: lazy agent behavior,\nin which one agent dominates while the other contributes little, undermining\ncollaboration and collapsing the setup to an ineffective single agent. In this\npaper, we first provide a theoretical analysis showing why lazy behavior\nnaturally arises in multi-agent reasoning.

This constraint leads to poor generalization\nand limited versatility. The recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language\nModels (MLLMs) introduce new possibilities for a unified CD framework.

Yet, progress has largely focused on language-centric tasks\nsuch as program synthesis and debugging, leaving visual-centric coding\nunderexplored. Inspired by how humans reason over sketches, we advocate SVG\ncode as a compact, interpretable, and executable visual representation. We\nintroduce VCode, a benchmark that reframes multimodal understanding as code\ngeneration: given an image, a model must produce SVG that preserves symbolic\nmeaning for downstream reasoning. VCode covers three domains - general\ncommonsense (MM-Vet), professional disciplines (MMMU), and visual-centric\nperception (CV-Bench). To assess symbolic fidelity, we propose CodeVQA, a novel\nevaluation protocol in which a policy model answers questions over rendered\nSVGs; correct answers indicate faithful symbolic preservation. Empirically,\nfrontier VLMs struggle to generate faithful SVGs, revealing a persistent gap\nbetween language-centric and visual-centric coding. To close this gap, we\nintroduce VCoder, an agentic framework that augments VLMs along two axes: (i)\nThinking with Revision, which iteratively analyzes discrepancies and refines\nSVG code; and (ii) Acting with Visual Tools, where detectors and parsers supply\nstructured cues such as objects, shapes, and text beyond the model's intrinsic\ncapacity. Across benchmarks, frontier VLMs with strong reasoning capabilities\nscore well overall yet remain limited in professional knowledge and 3D\nreasoning.
