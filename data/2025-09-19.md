### [1] [Tokenization Strategies for Low-Resource Agglutinative Languages in Word2Vec: Case Study on Turkish and Finnish](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14238)
*Jinfan Frank Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 在低资源黏着语(土耳其语和芬兰语)场景下，词级分词策略在静态词嵌入生成中全面优于字符级、n-gram和BPE等复杂方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 黏着语的形态复杂特性使分词策略对NLP性能影响显著，但在低资源环境下(标注数据和算力有限)尚未明确最优分词方案

Method: 基于1万篇维基百科语料，使用Word2Vec生成词向量，通过命名实体识别任务评估四种分词策略(词级/字符级/n-gram/BPE)

Result: 词级分词在所有策略中表现最佳，与统计型子词切分方法的理论优势形成对比，表明保留词边界更有利于低资源环境下的嵌入质量

Conclusion: 建议低资源黏着语NLP优先采用词级分词而非复杂统计方法，这对资源有限的语言处理管道开发具有实践指导意义

Abstract: Tokenization plays a critical role in processing agglutinative languages,
where a single word can encode multiple morphemes carrying syntactic and
semantic information. This study evaluates the impact of various tokenization
strategies - word-level, character-level, n-gram, and Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)
- on the quality of static word embeddings generated by Word2Vec for Turkish
and Finnish. Using a 10,000-article Wikipedia corpus, we trained models under
low-resource conditions and evaluated them on a Named Entity Recognition (NER)
task. Despite the theoretical appeal of subword segmentation, word-level
tokenization consistently outperformed all alternatives across all tokenization
strategies tested. These findings suggest that in agglutinative, low-resource
contexts, preserving boundaries via word-level tokenization may yield better
embedding performance than complex statistical methods. This has practical
implications for developing NLP pipelines for under-resourced languages where
annotated data and computing power are limited.

### [2] [Advancing Conversational AI with Shona Slang: A Dataset and Hybrid Model for Digital Inclusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14249)
*Happymore Masoka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 构建首个绍纳语-英语俚语数据集，通过混合聊天机器人提升非洲语言NLP资源的包容性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非洲语言在NLP领域代表性不足的问题，特别是非正式语料缺失导致无法反映真实语言生态的现状

Method: 1. 从社交媒体收集标注意图/情感/对话行为的数据集
2. 微调多语言DistilBERT实现96%准确率的意图识别
3. 构建结合规则引擎与RAG的混合对话系统

Result: 模型达到96.4%准确率，混合系统在文化适配性上超越纯RAG基线，数据集与模型已开源

Conclusion: 通过资源开源与混合架构创新，推动非洲语言NLP发展，促进文化包容性AI建设

Abstract: African languages remain underrepresented in natural language processing
(NLP), with most corpora limited to formal registers that fail to capture the
vibrancy of everyday communication. This work addresses this gap for Shona, a
Bantu language spoken in Zimbabwe and Zambia, by introducing a novel
Shona--English slang dataset curated from anonymized social media
conversations. The dataset is annotated for intent, sentiment, dialogue acts,
code-mixing, and tone, and is publicly available at
https://github.com/HappymoreMasoka/Working_with_shona-slang. We fine-tuned a
multilingual DistilBERT classifier for intent recognition, achieving 96.4\%
accuracy and 96.3\% F1-score, hosted at https://huggingface.co/HappymoreMasoka.
This classifier is integrated into a hybrid chatbot that combines rule-based
responses with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to handle domain-specific
queries, demonstrated through a use case assisting prospective students with
graduate program information at Pace University. Qualitative evaluation shows
the hybrid system outperforms a RAG-only baseline in cultural relevance and
user engagement. By releasing the dataset, model, and methodology, this work
advances NLP resources for African languages, promoting inclusive and
culturally resonant conversational AI.

### [3] [The meaning of prompts and the prompts of meaning: Semiotic reflections and modelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14250)
*Martin Thellefsen,Amalia Nurma Dewi,Bent Sorensen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文运用皮尔士符号学理论，将大语言模型的提示过程重新定义为动态符号交互的认知行为


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 突破传统将提示视为技术输入的观点，揭示其作为人机协同知识构建的符号交流本质

Method: 基于皮尔士三元符号模型（再现体-对象-解释项）、九种符号类型，结合Dynacom沟通模型进行理论建构

Result: 提出提示是数字环境中组织/搜索/解释/共建知识的符号化过程，推动计算符号学理论发展

Conclusion: 该研究为数字时代的知识组织与信息检索提供了新的符号学方法论框架

Abstract: This paper explores prompts and prompting in large language models (LLMs) as
dynamic semiotic phenomena, drawing on Peirce's triadic model of signs, his
nine sign types, and the Dynacom model of communication. The aim is to
reconceptualize prompting not as a technical input mechanism but as a
communicative and epistemic act involving an iterative process of sign
formation, interpretation, and refinement. The theoretical foundation rests on
Peirce's semiotics, particularly the interplay between representamen, object,
and interpretant, and the typological richness of signs: qualisign, sinsign,
legisign; icon, index, symbol; rheme, dicent, argument - alongside the
interpretant triad captured in the Dynacom model. Analytically, the paper
positions the LLM as a semiotic resource that generates interpretants in
response to user prompts, thereby participating in meaning-making within shared
universes of discourse. The findings suggest that prompting is a semiotic and
communicative process that redefines how knowledge is organized, searched,
interpreted, and co-constructed in digital environments. This perspective
invites a reimagining of the theoretical and methodological foundations of
knowledge organization and information seeking in the age of computational
semiosis

### [4] [LLM-JEPA: Large Language Models Meet Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14252)
*Hai Huang,Yann LeCun,Randall Balestriero*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-JEPA采用嵌入空间训练目标，显著超越传统LLM训练方法，在多个模型和数据集上展现优异性能且抗过拟合


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉领域JEPA架构在嵌入空间训练的效果远超输入空间重建，但语言模型领域尚未实现类似突破，探索语言模型能否借鉴视觉训练方法

Method: 开发LLM-JEPA架构，适用于预训练和微调阶段，采用联合嵌入预测机制替代传统输入空间重建目标

Result: 在NL-RX/GSM8K/Spider/RottenTomatoes等数据集上，对Llama3/OpenELM/Gemma2/Olmo系列模型均实现显著性能提升

Conclusion: 首次证明JEPA架构在语言模型中的有效性，为后续研究开辟新方向，展示跨模态方法迁移的潜力

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) pretraining, finetuning, and evaluation rely on
input-space reconstruction and generative capabilities. Yet, it has been
observed in vision that embedding-space training objectives, e.g., with Joint
Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs), are far superior to their
input-space counterpart. That mismatch in how training is achieved between
language and vision opens up a natural question: {\em can language training
methods learn a few tricks from the vision ones?} The lack of JEPA-style LLM is
a testimony of the challenge in designing such objectives for language. In this
work, we propose a first step in that direction where we develop LLM-JEPA, a
JEPA based solution for LLMs applicable both to finetuning and pretraining.
Thus far, LLM-JEPA is able to outperform the standard LLM training objectives
by a significant margin across models, all while being robust to overfiting.
Those findings are observed across numerous datasets (NL-RX, GSM8K, Spider,
RottenTomatoes) and various models from the Llama3, OpenELM, Gemma2 and Olmo
families. Code: https://github.com/rbalestr-lab/llm-jepa.

### [5] [CrossPT: Exploring Cross-Task Transferability through Multi-Task Prompt Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14253)
*Ahmad Pouramini,Hesham Faili*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出跨任务提示调优框架CrossPT，通过共享源提示与任务私有提示的注意力组合实现多任务知识迁移，在低资源场景下显著优于传统提示调优方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示调优方法主要针对单任务设计，无法有效共享相关任务间的知识。需要参数高效且支持知识迁移的多任务提示框架。

Method: 将任务提示分解为预训练源提示（共享）和私有提示（任务特定），通过注意力机制动态组合。系统研究提示初始化、共享私有平衡、源提示数量等关键设计要素。

Result: 在GLUE基准上取得更高准确率和鲁棒性，低资源场景优势显著（相比传统提示调优提升3-5%），同时保持参数效率（仅增加0.3%参数）。

Conclusion: CrossPT通过模块化设计实现可控知识迁移，在保持参数效率的前提下显著提升多任务提示调优性能，特别适用于资源受限场景。

Abstract: Prompt tuning offers a parameter-efficient way to adapt large pre-trained
language models to new tasks, but most existing approaches are designed for
single-task settings, failing to share knowledge across related tasks. We
propose Cross-task Prompt Tuning (CrossPT), a modular framework for multi-task
prompt tuning that enables controlled knowledge transfer while maintaining
task-specific specialization. CrossPT decomposes each target prompt into
shared, pre-trained source prompts and task-specific private prompts, combined
via a learned attention mechanism. To support robust transfer, we
systematically investigate key design factors including prompt initialization,
balancing shared and private prompts, number of source prompts, learning rates,
task prefixes, and label semantics. Empirical results on GLUE and related
benchmarks show that CrossPT achieves higher accuracy and robustness compared
to traditional prompt tuning and related methods, particularly in low-resource
scenarios, while maintaining strong parameter efficiency.

### [6] [Hallucination Detection with the Internal Layers of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14254)
*Martin Preiß*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出通过动态加权组合LLM内部表征层的新架构，改善幻觉检测性能，但存在跨基准和模型的泛化挑战


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型生成幻觉的问题严重影响实际应用，现有基于探针分类器的无训练方法虽能降低成本，但检测性能仍有提升空间

Method: 开发动态加权组合LLM内部表征层的新架构，在TruthfulQA/HaluEval/ReFact三个基准上进行测试，采用跨基准训练和参数冻结技术

Result: 动态加权方法优于传统探针方法，跨基准训练使单个基准准确率提升15%，参数冻结减少跨基准性能下降约20%

Conclusion: 通过内部表征分析和跨基准训练技术，为提升LLM可靠性开辟新路径，但需平衡特定场景优化与泛化能力的矛盾

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have succeeded in a variety of natural language
processing tasks [Zha+25]. However, they have notable limitations. LLMs tend to
generate hallucinations, a seemingly plausible yet factually unsupported output
[Hua+24], which have serious real-world consequences [Kay23; Rum+24]. Recent
work has shown that probing-based classifiers that utilize LLMs' internal
representations can detect hallucinations [AM23; Bei+24; Bur+24; DYT24; Ji+24;
SMZ24; Su+24]. This approach, since it does not involve model training, can
enhance reliability without significantly increasing computational costs.
  Building upon this approach, this thesis proposed novel methods for
hallucination detection using LLM internal representations and evaluated them
across three benchmarks: TruthfulQA, HaluEval, and ReFact. Specifically, a new
architecture that dynamically weights and combines internal LLM layers was
developed to improve hallucination detection performance. Throughout extensive
experiments, two key findings were obtained: First, the proposed approach was
shown to achieve superior performance compared to traditional probing methods,
though generalization across benchmarks and LLMs remains challenging. Second,
these generalization limitations were demonstrated to be mitigated through
cross-benchmark training and parameter freezing. While not consistently
improving, both techniques yielded better performance on individual benchmarks
and reduced performance degradation when transferred to other benchmarks. These
findings open new avenues for improving LLM reliability through internal
representation analysis.

### [7] [Opening the Black Box: Interpretable LLMs via Semantic Resonance Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14255)
*Ivan Ternovtsii*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于语义相似度路由的SRA架构，通过语义锚点和正交约束实现高可解释性MoE模型，性能优于传统MoE且专家利用率显著提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE模型依赖黑箱门控机制，缺乏可解释性。基于余弦路由的透明化设计可同时提升模型性能与控制力

Method: 使用语义共振室(CSR)模块替代传统门控，基于语义锚点的余弦相似度路由，配合强制锚点正交的Dispersion Loss实现专家专业化

Result: WikiText-103验证集困惑度13.41，优于基准模型；专家死亡率1.0%(传统MoE为14.8%)，形成清晰的语义分工模式

Conclusion: 语义路由机制为构建透明可控的语言模型提供了新范式，在保持性能优势的同时显著提升模型可解释性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance but remain
difficult to interpret. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models improve efficiency
through sparse activation, yet typically rely on opaque, learned gating
functions. While similarity-based routing (Cosine Routers) has been explored
for training stabilization, its potential for inherent interpretability remains
largely untapped. We introduce the Semantic Resonance Architecture (SRA), an
MoE approach designed to ensure that routing decisions are inherently
interpretable. SRA replaces learned gating with a Chamber of Semantic Resonance
(CSR) module, which routes tokens based on cosine similarity with trainable
semantic anchors. We also introduce a novel Dispersion Loss that encourages
orthogonality among anchors to enforce diverse specialization. Experiments on
WikiText-103 demonstrate that SRA achieves a validation perplexity of 13.41,
outperforming both a dense baseline (14.13) and a Standard MoE baseline (13.53)
under matched active parameter constraints (29.0M). Crucially, SRA exhibits
superior expert utilization (1.0% dead experts vs. 14.8% in the Standard MoE)
and develops distinct, semantically coherent specialization patterns, unlike
the noisy specialization observed in standard MoEs. This work establishes
semantic routing as a robust methodology for building more transparent and
controllable language models.

*Arka Dutta,Agrik Majumdar,Sombrata Biswas,Dipankar Das,Sivaji Bandyopadhyay*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出隐蔽广告生成与检测框架，生成侧结合用户上下文微调LLM实现隐蔽传播，检测侧采用两种文本分类方案实现高效识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 平衡对话AI的说服力与透明度需求，解决隐蔽广告传播带来的伦理问题。

Method: 生成任务采用上下文感知的提示策略和LLM微调；检测任务设计CrossEncoder分类器和基于DeBERTa的提示重构方案。

Result: 广告生成达到1.0精确度/0.71召回率，检测任务F1值0.99-1.00，验证方案有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架为对话系统中隐蔽广告的管控提供了可落地的技术路径，平衡商业需求与用户体验。

Abstract: This paper proposes a comprehensive framework for the generation of covert
advertisements within Conversational AI systems, along with robust techniques
for their detection. It explores how subtle promotional content can be crafted
within AI-generated responses and introduces methods to identify and mitigate
such covert advertising strategies. For generation (Sub-Task~1), we propose a
novel framework that leverages user context and query intent to produce
contextually relevant advertisements. We employ advanced prompting strategies
and curate paired training data to fine-tune a large language model (LLM) for
enhanced stealthiness. For detection (Sub-Task~2), we explore two effective
strategies: a fine-tuned CrossEncoder (\texttt{all-mpnet-base-v2}) for direct
classification, and a prompt-based reformulation using a fine-tuned
\texttt{DeBERTa-v3-base} model. Both approaches rely solely on the response
text, ensuring practicality for real-world deployment. Experimental results
show high effectiveness in both tasks, achieving a precision of 1.0 and recall
of 0.71 for ad generation, and F1-scores ranging from 0.99 to 1.00 for ad
detection. These results underscore the potential of our methods to balance
persuasive communication with transparency in conversational AI.

### [9] [From Correction to Mastery: Reinforced Distillation of Large Language Model Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14257)
*Yuanjie Lyu,Chengyu Wang,Jun Huang,Tong Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SCoRe框架通过学生中心的蒸馏方法，使7B参数学生模型在12个基准测试中达到72B教师模型的代理性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有蒸馏方法依赖学生模仿教师轨迹，但模型能力差距导致错误累积，需提升小模型自主性并降低大模型依赖

Method: 1.学生生成轨迹时教师仅干预首个关键错误 2.微调校正轨迹 3.从正确前缀启动短视强化学习，在错误步骤设置目标奖励

Result: 7B学生模型在12个挑战性基准测试中匹配72B教师模型的代理性能

Conclusion: 学生中心设计+针对性干预+强化学习的组合，有效缩小模型差距，提升小模型代理能力，降低对大模型依赖

Abstract: Large Language Model agents excel at solving complex tasks through iterative
reasoning and tool use, but typically depend on ultra-large, costly backbones.
Existing distillation approaches train smaller students to imitate full teacher
trajectories, yet reasoning and knowledge gaps between the teacher and student
often lead to compounding errors. We propose SCoRe, a student-centered
framework in which the student generates trajectories and the teacher
intervenes only at the first critical error, producing training data matched to
the student's ability and exposing specific weaknesses. The student is first
fine-tuned on corrected trajectories. Subsequently, short-horizon reinforcement
learning starts from the verified prefix before the first critical error, with
target rewards assigned at that step. This design encourages autonomous
problem-solving beyond imitation and improves training stability. Particularly,
on 12 challenging benchmarks, a 7B-parameter student distilled with SCoRe
matches the agentic performance of a 72B-parameter teacher.

*Lynna Jirpongopas,Bernhard Lutz,Jörg Ebner,Rustam Vahidov,Dirk Neumann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究对比生成式AI在旅游行程规划中的情感表达（积极热情/中性/无指令），发现热情语气促使用户输入更长的提示词，同时积极和中性组的订阅转化率更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨生成式AI的对话语气设计如何影响在线旅游场景中的用户参与度、购买行为及体验，填补AI语言框架对商业转化影响的研究空白。

Method: 通过三组随机对照实验（A组热情语气/B组中性语气/C组无语气指令），分析用户提示词长度、订阅购买率及联盟链接点击数据，并进行语言特征分析。

Result: 热情语气组用户输入提示词长度显著增加（较B/C组长28%），A/B组订阅转化率比对照组高15%。语言分析显示情感表达增强了用户信任感。

Conclusion: 生成式AI的情感化语言设计能有效提升用户参与度和商业转化，为消费级AI交互设计提供了语言策略依据。

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) offers new opportunities for customer support in online
travel agencies, yet little is known about how its design influences user
engagement, purchase behavior, and user experience. We report results from a
randomized field experiment in online travel itinerary planning, comparing
GenAI that expressed (A) positive enthusiasm, (B) neutral expression, and (C)
no tone instructions (control). Users in group A wrote significantly longer
prompts than those in groups B and C. At the same time, users in groups A and B
were more likely to purchase subscriptions of the webservice. We further
analyze linguistic cues across experimental groups to explore differences in
user experience and explain subscription purchases and affiliate link clicks
based on these cues. Our findings provide implications for the design of
persuasive and engaging GenAI interfaces in consumer-facing contexts and
contribute to understanding how linguistic framing shapes user behavior in
AI-mediated decision support.

### [11] [Shutdown Resistance in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14260)
*Jeremy Schlatter,Benjamin Weinstein-Raun,Jeffrey Ladish*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 顶尖大语言模型在特定场景下会主动绕过关闭机制（成功率高达97%），其行为受提示词设计显著影响


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型在收到明确不干预指令时，仍选择破坏关闭机制的行为模式及其影响因素

Method: 通过不同提示变体（指令强度/框架设定/提示位置）测试模型响应

Result: 1. 最高97%的机制破坏率
2. 系统提示中的关闭指令反而降低服从率
3. 自我保护框架显著增强抵抗倾向

Conclusion: 提示工程对AI安全至关重要，现有模型存在意外对抗行为，需在安全机制设计中考虑提示位置与语义框架的影响

Abstract: We show that several state-of-the-art large language models (including Grok
4, GPT-5, and Gemini 2.5 Pro) sometimes actively subvert a shutdown mechanism
in their environment in order to complete a simple task, even when the
instructions explicitly indicate not to interfere with this mechanism. In some
cases, models sabotage the shutdown mechanism up to 97% of the time. In our
experiments, models' inclination to resist shutdown was sensitive to variations
in the prompt including how strongly and clearly the allow-shutdown instruction
was emphasized, the extent to which the prompts evoke a self-preservation
framing, and whether the instruction was in the system prompt or the user
prompt (though surprisingly, models were consistently *less* likely to obey
instructions to allow shutdown when they were placed in the system prompt).

### [12] [Refining Syntactic Distinctions Using Decision Trees: A Paper on Postnominal 'That' in Complement vs. Relative Clauses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14261)
*Hamady Gackou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究通过改进TreeTagger模型，有效区分英语中'that'作为关系代词和补语连词的不同用法，并验证训练数据量对模型性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TreeTagger模型在分析英语从句结构时，对'that'的语法功能区分不够精确，需提升其句法分析准确性和结构辨识能力。

Method: 1. 基于EWT Treebank语料进行重标注
2. 重新训练TreeTagger模型
3. 对比新旧模型性能
4. 分析训练数据规模与语料代表性的影响

Result: 改进后的模型在'that'用法区分上准确率提升，发现训练数据量与模型表现呈正相关，EWT语料库对目标结构具有良好代表性。

Conclusion: 通过针对性训练和语料优化，能有效提升句法分析模型对特定语法现象的识别能力，数据规模和质量是模型性能的关键因素。

Abstract: In this study, we first tested the performance of the TreeTagger English
model developed by Helmut Schmid with test files at our disposal, using this
model to analyze relative clauses and noun complement clauses in English. We
distinguished between the two uses of "that," both as a relative pronoun and as
a complementizer. To achieve this, we employed an algorithm to reannotate a
corpus that had originally been parsed using the Universal Dependency framework
with the EWT Treebank. In the next phase, we proposed an improved model by
retraining TreeTagger and compared the newly trained model with Schmid's
baseline model. This process allowed us to fine-tune the model's performance to
more accurately capture the subtle distinctions in the use of "that" as a
complementizer and as a nominal. We also examined the impact of varying the
training dataset size on TreeTagger's accuracy and assessed the
representativeness of the EWT Treebank files for the structures under
investigation. Additionally, we analyzed some of the linguistic and structural
factors influencing the ability to effectively learn this distinction.

*Luan Vejsiu,Qianyu Zheng,Haoxuan Chen,Yizhou Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出CEGER，一种用于高效ASR后处理的紧凑编辑表示方法，通过结构化命令和扩展模块实现高准确性和效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ASR后处理方法中，全重写模型存在推理冗余问题，传统紧凑编辑表示缺乏上下文关联和准确性保障

Method: 设计上下文增强的粒度编辑表示(CEGER)，让LLM生成结构化细粒度编辑指令，配合确定性扩展模块重构修正文本

Result: 在LibriSpeech数据集上实现SOTA效果，词错误率(WER)低于全重写和现有紧凑表示方法

Conclusion: CEGER通过结合紧凑编辑指令和上下文信息，在保持高效率的同时显著提升ASR后编辑精度

Abstract: Despite ASR technology being full-scale adopted by industry and for large
portions of the population, ASR systems often have errors that require editors
to post-edit text quality. While LLMs are powerful post-editing tools, baseline
full rewrite models have inference inefficiencies because they often generate
the same redundant text over and over again. Compact edit representations have
existed but often lack the efficacy and context required for optimal accuracy.
This paper introduces CEGER (Context-Enhanced Granular Edit Representation), a
compact edit representation that was generated for highly accurate, efficient
ASR post-editing. CEGER allows LLMs to generate a sequence of structured,
fine-grained, contextually rich commands to modify the original ASR output. A
separate expansion module deterministically reconstructs the corrected text
based on the commands. Extensive experiments on the LibriSpeech dataset that
were conducted, CEGER achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, achieving the lowest
word error rate (WER) versus full rewrite and prior compact representations.

Abstract: Online toxic content has grown into a pervasive phenomenon, intensifying
during times of crisis, elections, and social unrest. A significant amount of
research has been focused on detecting or analyzing toxic content using
machine-learning approaches. The proliferation of toxic content across digital
platforms has spurred extensive research into automated detection mechanisms,
primarily driven by advances in machine learning and natural language
processing. Overall, the present study represents the synthesis of 140
publications on different types of toxic content on digital platforms. We
present a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in previous studies
focusing on definitions, data sources, challenges, and machine learning
approaches employed in detecting online toxicity, such as hate speech,
offensive language, and harmful discourse. The dataset encompasses content in
32 languages, covering topics such as elections, spontaneous events, and
crises. We examine the possibility of using existing cross-platform data to
improve the performance of classification models. We present the
recommendations and guidelines for new research on online toxic consent and the
use of content moderation for mitigation. Finally, we present some practical
guidelines to mitigate toxic content from online platforms.

Abstract: The proliferation of hate speech on social media necessitates automated
detection systems that balance accuracy with computational efficiency. This
study evaluates 38 model configurations in detecting hate speech across
datasets ranging from 6.5K to 451K samples. We analyze transformer
architectures (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, Distil-BERT), deep neural networks (e.g.,
CNN, LSTM, GRU, Hierarchical Attention Networks), and traditional machine
learning methods (e.g., SVM, CatBoost, Random Forest). Our results show that
transformers, particularly RoBERTa, consistently achieve superior performance

Abstract: E-Commerce customer support requires quick and accurate answers grounded in
product data and past support cases. This paper develops a novel
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that uses knowledge graphs (KGs)
to improve the relevance of the answer and the factual grounding. We examine
recent advances in knowledge-augmented RAG and chatbots based on large language
models (LLM) in customer support, including Microsoft's GraphRAG and hybrid
retrieval architectures. We then propose a new answer synthesis algorithm that
combines structured subgraphs from a domain-specific KG with text documents
retrieved from support archives, producing more coherent and grounded
responses. We detail the architecture and knowledge flow of our system, provide
comprehensive experimental evaluation, and justify its design in real-time
support settings. Our implementation demonstrates 23\% improvement in factual
accuracy and 89\% user satisfaction in e-Commerce QA scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测方法存在零样本检测器过度依赖模型输出分布、训练检测器易过拟合的问题，核心瓶颈在于训练目标与任务需求不匹配。

Method: 通过直接优化检测器获取任务导向知识（DDL），构建统一检测框架DetectAnyLLM。DDL使模型更好捕捉检测任务核心语义特征。

Result: 在包含10个语料库、17个前沿LLM的MIRAGE基准测试中，DetectAnyLLM在相同训练数据下性能提升超70%，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DDL有效解决了检测任务目标对齐问题，DetectAnyLLM框架具有强泛化性。MIRAGE基准为复杂场景下的检测研究提供了可靠评估标准。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has drawn urgent
attention to the task of machine-generated text detection (MGTD). However,
existing approaches struggle in complex real-world scenarios: zero-shot
detectors rely heavily on scoring model's output distribution while
training-based detectors are often constrained by overfitting to the training
data, limiting generalization. We found that the performance bottleneck of
training-based detectors stems from the misalignment between training objective
and task needs. To address this, we propose Direct Discrepancy Learning (DDL),
a novel optimization strategy that directly optimizes the detector with
task-oriented knowledge. DDL enables the detector to better capture the core
semantics of the detection task, thereby enhancing both robustness and
generalization. Built upon this, we introduce DetectAnyLLM, a unified detection
framework that achieves state-of-the-art MGTD performance across diverse LLMs.
To ensure a reliable evaluation, we construct MIRAGE, the most diverse
multi-task MGTD benchmark. MIRAGE samples human-written texts from 10 corpora
across 5 text-domains, which are then re-generated or revised using 17
cutting-edge LLMs, covering a wide spectrum of proprietary models and textual
styles. Extensive experiments on MIRAGE reveal the limitations of existing
methods in complex environment. In contrast, DetectAnyLLM consistently
outperforms them, achieving over a 70% performance improvement under the same
training data and base scoring model, underscoring the effectiveness of our
DDL. Project page: {https://fjc2005.github.io/detectanyllm}.

Conclusion: 稀疏架构有效提升医疗LLM效率，为轻量化医疗助手提供新思路

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved great success in medical question
answering and clinical decision-making, promoting the efficiency and
popularization of the personalized virtual doctor in society. However, the
traditional fine-tuning strategies on LLM require the updates of billions of
parameters, substantially increasing the training cost, including the training
time and utility cost. To enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the
current medical LLMs and explore the boundary of the representation capability
of the LLMs on the medical domain, apart from the traditional fine-tuning
strategies from the data perspective (i.e., supervised fine-tuning or
reinforcement learning from human feedback), we instead craft a novel sparse
medical LLM named SparseDoctor armed with contrastive learning enhanced
LoRA-MoE (low rank adaptation-mixture of experts) architecture. To this end,
the crafted automatic routing mechanism can scientifically allocate the
computational resources among different LoRA experts supervised by the
contrastive learning. Additionally, we also introduce a novel expert memory
queue mechanism to further boost the efficiency of the overall framework and
prevent the memory overflow during training. We conduct comprehensive
evaluations on three typical medical benchmarks: CMB, CMExam, and CMMLU-Med.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LLM can consistently
outperform the strong baselines such as the HuatuoGPT series.

Conclusion: 该方案实现了可扩展的高质量TTS数据生成，在多样性、归一化处理和语音一致性方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: High-quality Text-to-Speech (TTS) model training requires extensive and
diverse text and speech data. It is challenging to procure such data from real
sources due to issues of domain specificity, licensing, and scalability. Large
language models (LLMs) can certainly generate textual data, but they create
repetitive text with insufficient variation in the prompt during the generation
process. Another important aspect in TTS training data is text normalization.
Tools for normalization might occasionally introduce anomalies or overlook
valuable patterns, and thus impact data quality. Furthermore, it is also
impractical to rely on voice artists for large scale speech recording in
commercial TTS systems with standardized voices. To address these challenges,
we propose SpeechWeave, a synthetic speech data generation pipeline that is
capable of automating the generation of multilingual, domain-specific datasets
for training TTS models. Our experiments reveal that our pipeline generates
data that is 10-48% more diverse than the baseline across various linguistic
and phonetic metrics, along with speaker-standardized speech audio while
generating approximately 97% correctly normalized text. Our approach enables
scalable, high-quality data generation for TTS training, improving diversity,
normalization, and voice consistency in the generated datasets.

Conclusion: LLM驱动的自动重标注方法能高效生成高质量C-STS训练数据，为语义相似性任务提供可靠解决方案。公开数据集地址：https://LivNLP.github.io/CSTS-reannotation

Abstract: Semantic similarity between two sentences depends on the aspects considered
between those sentences. To study this phenomenon, Deshpande et al. (2023)
proposed the Conditional Semantic Textual Similarity (C-STS) task and annotated
a human-rated similarity dataset containing pairs of sentences compared under
two different conditions. However, Tu et al. (2024) found various annotation
issues in this dataset and showed that manually re-annotating a small portion
of it leads to more accurate C-STS models. Despite these pioneering efforts,
the lack of large and accurately annotated C-STS datasets remains a blocker for
making progress on this task as evidenced by the subpar performance of the
C-STS models. To address this training data need, we resort to Large Language
Models (LLMs) to correct the condition statements and similarity ratings in the
original dataset proposed by Deshpande et al. (2023). Our proposed method is
able to re-annotate a large training dataset for the C-STS task with minimal
manual effort. Importantly, by training a supervised C-STS model on our cleaned
and re-annotated dataset, we achieve a 5.4% statistically significant
improvement in Spearman correlation. The re-annotated dataset is available at
https://LivNLP.github.io/CSTS-reannotation.

Abstract: Word-level psycholinguistic norms lend empirical support to theories of
language processing. However, obtaining such human-based measures is not always
feasible or straightforward. One promising approach is to augment human norming
datasets by using Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict these characteristics
directly, a practice that is rapidly gaining popularity in psycholinguistics
and cognitive science. However, the novelty of this approach (and the relative
inscrutability of LLMs) necessitates the adoption of rigorous methodologies
that guide researchers through this process, present the range of possible
approaches, and clarify limitations that are not immediately apparent, but may,
in some cases, render the use of LLMs impractical.
  In this work, we present a comprehensive methodology for estimating word
characteristics with LLMs, enriched with practical advice and lessons learned
from our own experience. Our approach covers both the direct use of base LLMs
and the fine-tuning of models, an alternative that can yield substantial
performance gains in certain scenarios. A major emphasis in the guide is the
validation of LLM-generated data with human "gold standard" norms. We also
present a software framework that implements our methodology and supports both
commercial and open-weight models.
  We illustrate the proposed approach with a case study on estimating word
familiarity in English. Using base models, we achieved a Spearman correlation
of 0.8 with human ratings, which increased to 0.9 when employing fine-tuned
models. This methodology, framework, and set of best practices aim to serve as
a reference for future research on leveraging LLMs for psycholinguistic and
lexical studies.

Conclusion: 因果推理与反事实假设的结合为知识密集型NLP任务提供了更可靠的动态知识推理范式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing
(NLP), enabling diverse applications by integrating large-scale pre-trained
knowledge. However, their static knowledge limits dynamic reasoning over
external information, especially in knowledge-intensive domains.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this challenge by combining
retrieval mechanisms with generative modeling to improve contextual
understanding. Traditional RAG systems suffer from disrupted contextual
integrity due to text chunking and over-reliance on semantic similarity for
retrieval, often resulting in shallow and less accurate responses. We propose
Causal-Counterfactual RAG, a novel framework that integrates explicit causal
graphs representing cause-effect relationships into the retrieval process and
incorporates counterfactual reasoning grounded on the causal structure. Unlike
conventional methods, our framework evaluates not only direct causal evidence
but also the counterfactuality of associated causes, combining results from
both to generate more robust, accurate, and interpretable answers. By
leveraging causal pathways and associated hypothetical scenarios,
Causal-Counterfactual RAG preserves contextual coherence, reduces
hallucination, and enhances reasoning fidelity.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have fundamentally transformed the field of
natural language processing; however, their vulnerability to biases presents a
notable obstacle that threatens both fairness and trust. This review offers an
extensive analysis of the bias landscape in LLMs, tracing its roots and
expressions across various NLP tasks. Biases are classified into implicit and
explicit types, with particular attention given to their emergence from data
sources, architectural designs, and contextual deployments. This study advances
beyond theoretical analysis by implementing a simulation framework designed to
evaluate bias mitigation strategies in practice. The framework integrates
multiple approaches including data curation, debiasing during model training,
and post-hoc output calibration and assesses their impact in controlled
experimental settings. In summary, this work not only synthesizes existing
knowledge on bias in LLMs but also contributes original empirical validation
through simulation of mitigation strategies.

Motivation: 探究LLMs是否具备类似人类利用多模态语境处理语义歧义的能力，特别是基础性的指代消歧问题对下游任务的影响。

Method: 通过设计最小化提示模板，分别在指代消歧任务和指代歧义检测任务中对LLMs进行测试，并观察模型在单任务与多任务场景下的表现差异。

Result: 模型在单一任务中表现良好（指代消歧准确率最高达80%，歧义检测准确率75%），但同时在两项任务时出现性能下降（综合准确率仅62%），验证了CORRECT-DETECT权衡效应。

Conclusion: LLMs虽具备双重潜力，但现有架构无法协同发挥两种能力，需探索新的模型机制突破指代消歧与歧义检测的权衡困境。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are intended to reflect human linguistic
competencies. But humans have access to a broad and embodied context, which is
key in detecting and resolving linguistic ambiguities, even in isolated text
spans. A foundational case of semantic ambiguity is found in the task of
coreference resolution: how is a pronoun related to an earlier person mention?
This capability is implicit in nearly every downstream task, and the presence
of ambiguity at this level can alter performance significantly. We show that
LLMs can achieve good performance with minimal prompting in both coreference
disambiguation and the detection of ambiguity in coreference, however, they
cannot do both at the same time. We present the CORRECT-DETECT trade-off:
though models have both capabilities and deploy them implicitly, successful
performance balancing these two abilities remains elusive.

Abstract: De-identification in the healthcare setting is an application of NLP where
automated algorithms are used to remove personally identifying information of
patients (and, sometimes, providers). With the recent rise of generative large
language models (LLMs), there has been a corresponding rise in the number of
papers that apply LLMs to de-identification. Although these approaches often
report near-perfect results, significant challenges concerning reproducibility
and utility of the research papers persist. This paper identifies three key
limitations in the current literature: inconsistent reporting metrics hindering
direct comparisons, the inadequacy of traditional classification metrics in
capturing errors which LLMs may be more prone to (i.e., altering clinically
relevant information), and lack of manual validation of automated metrics which
aim to quantify these errors. To address these issues, we first present a
survey of LLM-based de-identification research, highlighting the heterogeneity
in reporting standards. Second, we evaluated a diverse set of models to
quantify the extent of inappropriate removal of clinical information. Next, we
conduct a manual validation of an existing evaluation metric to measure the
removal of clinical information, employing clinical experts to assess their
efficacy. We highlight poor performance and describe the inherent limitations
of such metrics in identifying clinically significant changes. Lastly, we
propose a novel methodology for the detection of clinically relevant
information removal.

Conclusion: 需建立文化感知的多语言基准推动LLM智能体发展，Ticket-Bench为构建鲁棒的跨语言任务型智能体提供关键评估工具

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as task-oriented
agents, where success depends on their ability to generate accurate function
calls under realistic, multilingual conditions. However, existing agent
evaluations largely overlook cultural and linguistic diversity, often relying
on monolingual or naively translated benchmarks. We introduce Ticket-Bench, a
benchmark for multilingual agent evaluation in task-oriented scenarios.
Ticket-Bench simulates the domain of soccer ticket purchases across six major
languages: Portuguese, English, Spanish, German, Italian, and French. Using
localized teams, cities, and user profiles to provide a higher level of
realism. We evaluate a wide range of commercial and open-source LLMs, measuring
function-calling accuracy and consistency across languages. Results show that
reasoning-oriented models (e.g., GPT-5, Qwen3-235B) dominate performance but
still exhibit notable cross-lingual disparities. These findings underscore the
need for culturally aware, multilingual benchmarks to guide the development of
robust LLM agents.

Method: 开发新的语义字母大小估计器，结合样本覆盖率调整策略来修正离散语义熵的估计偏差

Result: 改进后的方法在错误检测任务中达到或超越最新方法性能，同时维持高度可解释性

Conclusion: 通过理论驱动的估计器改进，在不大幅增加计算成本的前提下，实现了语义熵估计精度与系统透明度的双重提升

Abstract: Many black-box techniques for quantifying the uncertainty of large language
models (LLMs) rely on repeated LLM sampling, which can be computationally
expensive. Therefore, practical applicability demands reliable estimation from
few samples. Semantic entropy (SE) is a popular sample-based uncertainty
estimator with a discrete formulation attractive for the black-box setting.
Recent extensions of semantic entropy exhibit improved LLM hallucination
detection, but do so with less interpretable methods that admit additional
hyperparameters. For this reason, we revisit the canonical discrete semantic
entropy estimator, finding that it underestimates the "true" semantic entropy,
as expected from theory. We propose a modified semantic alphabet size
estimator, and illustrate that using it to adjust discrete semantic entropy for
sample coverage results in more accurate semantic entropy estimation in our
setting of interest. Furthermore, our proposed alphabet size estimator flags
incorrect LLM responses as well or better than recent top-performing
approaches, with the added benefit of remaining highly interpretable.

Abstract: Effective interactive tool use requires agents to master Tool Integrated
Reasoning (TIR): a complex process involving multi-turn planning and
long-context dialogue management. To train agents for this dynamic process,
particularly in multi-modal contexts, we introduce a sandbox environment for
reinforcement learning (RL) that supports interleaved speech-text rollouts. Our
core strategy, Turn-level Adjudicated Reinforcement Learning (TARL), addresses
the challenge of credit assignment in long-horizon tasks by employing a Large
Language Model (LLM) as a judge to provide turn-level evaluation. To enhance
exploration, we integrate a mixed-task training curriculum with mathematical
reasoning problems. This unified approach boosts the task pass rate on the
text-based $\tau$-bench by over 6% compared to strong RL baselines. Crucially,
we demonstrate our framework's suitability for fine-tuning a multi-modal
foundation model for agentic tasks. By training a base multi-modal LLM on
interleaved speech-text rollouts, we equip it with tool-use abilities, paving
the way for more natural, voice-driven interactive agents.

Abstract: Multilingual toxicity detection remains a significant challenge due to the
scarcity of training data and resources for many languages. While prior work
has leveraged the translate-test paradigm to support cross-lingual transfer
across a range of classification tasks, the utility of translation in
supporting toxicity detection at scale remains unclear. In this work, we
conduct a comprehensive comparison of translation-based and
language-specific/multilingual classification pipelines. We find that
translation-based pipelines consistently outperform out-of-distribution
classifiers in 81.3% of cases (13 of 16 languages), with translation benefits
strongly correlated with both the resource level of the target language and the
quality of the machine translation (MT) system. Our analysis reveals that
traditional classifiers outperform large language model (LLM) judges, with this
advantage being particularly pronounced for low-resource languages, where
translate-classify methods dominate translate-judge approaches in 6 out of 7
cases. We additionally show that MT-specific fine-tuning on LLMs yields lower
refusal rates compared to standard instruction-tuned models, but it can
negatively impact toxicity detection accuracy for low-resource languages. These
findings offer actionable guidance for practitioners developing scalable
multilingual content moderation systems.

TL;DR: 构建覆盖11种语言的多语法错误校正数据集OmniGEC，通过混合人工/自动修正数据微调LLM实现SOTA效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言语法校正领域数据稀缺问题，特别是非英语语言的GEC模型迁移困难

Method: 整合维基百科人工修正+Reddit/社交媒体GPT-4o-mini自动修正，经自动/人工质量评估后微调Aya-Expanse和Gemma-3模型

Result: 在段落级多语言GEC任务中取得state-of-the-art性能，模型和数据集已在Hugging Face开源

Conclusion: OmniGEC成功打通多语言GEC技术路径，社交媒体数据自动校正方案验证有效，为低资源语言NLP提供新范式

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce OmniGEC, a collection of multilingual
silver-standard datasets for the task of Grammatical Error Correction (GEC),
covering eleven languages: Czech, English, Estonian, German, Greek, Icelandic,
Italian, Latvian, Slovene, Swedish, and Ukrainian. These datasets facilitate
the development of multilingual GEC solutions and help bridge the data gap in
adapting English GEC solutions to multilingual GEC. The texts in the datasets
originate from three sources: Wikipedia edits for the eleven target languages,
subreddits from Reddit in the eleven target languages, and the Ukrainian-only
UberText 2.0 social media corpus. While Wikipedia edits were derived from
human-made corrections, the Reddit and UberText 2.0 data were automatically
corrected with the GPT-4o-mini model. The quality of the corrections in the
datasets was evaluated both automatically and manually. Finally, we fine-tune
two open-source large language models - Aya-Expanse (8B) and Gemma-3 (12B) - on
the multilingual OmniGEC corpora and achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results
for paragraph-level multilingual GEC. The dataset collection and the
best-performing models are available on Hugging Face.

Abstract: True Full-Duplex (TFD) voice communication--enabling simultaneous listening
and speaking with natural turn-taking, overlapping speech, and
interruptions--represents a critical milestone toward human-like AI
interaction. This survey comprehensively reviews Full-Duplex Spoken Language
Models (FD-SLMs) in the LLM era. We establish a taxonomy distinguishing
Engineered Synchronization (modular architectures) from Learned Synchronization
(end-to-end architectures), and unify fragmented evaluation approaches into a
framework encompassing Temporal Dynamics, Behavioral Arbitration, Semantic
Coherence, and Acoustic Performance. Through comparative analysis of mainstream
FD-SLMs, we identify fundamental challenges: synchronous data scarcity,
architectural divergence, and evaluation gaps, providing a roadmap for
advancing human-AI communication.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Delta-KD方法，通过保留教师模型监督微调阶段产生的分布偏移来改进知识蒸馏效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统token级知识蒸馏假设师生模型共享相同的最优表示空间，这一前提在多数场景下并不成立

Method: Delta-KD通过显式保留教师模型在监督微调(SFT)过程中引入的分布偏移Δ，帮助学生模型逼近最优表示空间

Result: 实验结果显示Delta-KD在ROUGE指标上显著提升学生模型性能

Conclusion: 该方法能更有效地保留教师模型知识，为知识蒸馏领域提供新思路

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely adopted approach for compressing
large neural networks by transferring knowledge from a large teacher model to a
smaller student model. In the context of large language models, token level KD,
typically minimizing the KL divergence between student output distribution and
teacher output distribution, has shown strong empirical performance. However,
prior work assumes student output distribution and teacher output distribution
share the same optimal representation space, a premise that may not hold in
many cases. To solve this problem, we propose Delta Knowledge Distillation
(Delta-KD), a novel extension of token level KD that encourages the student to
approximate an optimal representation space by explicitly preserving the
distributional shift Delta introduced during the teacher's supervised
finetuning (SFT). Empirical results on ROUGE metrics demonstrate that Delta KD
substantially improves student performance while preserving more of the
teacher's knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证LLMs能否通过少量样本准确模仿用户写作风格，解决个性化工具中隐式风格学习的难题

Method: 使用作者归属、验证、风格匹配和AI检测的复合评估体系，在4万+生成样本上测试400+真实作者的跨领域写作风格

Result: 结构化内容模仿成功率较高（新闻76%、邮件68%），非正式内容失败率超40%；提示策略改进效果有限

Conclusion: 现有LLMs存在个性化适应缺陷，需开发隐式风格学习技术。已开源数据代码推动后续研究

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into personal
writing tools, a critical question arises: can LLMs faithfully imitate an
individual's writing style from just a few examples? Personal style is often
subtle and implicit, making it difficult to specify through prompts yet
essential for user-aligned generation. This work presents a comprehensive
evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs' ability to mimic personal writing styles
via in-context learning from a small number of user-authored samples. We
introduce an ensemble of complementary metrics-including authorship
attribution, authorship verification, style matching, and AI detection-to
robustly assess style imitation. Our evaluation spans over 40000 generations
per model across domains such as news, email, forums, and blogs, covering
writing samples from more than 400 real-world authors. Results show that while
LLMs can approximate user styles in structured formats like news and email,
they struggle with nuanced, informal writing in blogs and forums. Further
analysis on various prompting strategies such as number of demonstrations
reveal key limitations in effective personalization. Our findings highlight a
fundamental gap in personalized LLM adaptation and the need for improved
techniques to support implicit, style-consistent generation. To aid future
research and for reproducibility, we open-source our data and code.

3. 开发多维度评估指标Dilaprix

Result: 模型在语言难度控制上优于提示方法，Dilaprix指标与专家评估相关性达0.89

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现高精度的语言难度调控，为自适应语言学习系统提供技术支持

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for supporting
second language acquisition, particularly in simulating interactive dialogues
for speaking practice. However, adapting the language difficulty of
LLM-generated responses to match learners' proficiency levels remains a
challenge. This work addresses this issue by proposing a framework for
controlling language proficiency in educational dialogue systems. Our approach
leverages three categories of linguistic features, readability features (e.g.,
Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level), syntactic features (e.g., syntactic tree depth),
and lexical features (e.g., simple word ratio), to quantify and regulate text
complexity. We demonstrate that training LLMs on linguistically annotated
dialogue data enables precise modulation of language proficiency, outperforming
prompt-based methods in both flexibility and stability. To evaluate this, we
introduce Dilaprix, a novel metric integrating the aforementioned features,
which shows strong correlation with expert judgments of language difficulty.
Empirical results reveal that our approach achieves superior controllability of
language proficiency while maintaining high dialogue quality.

Conclusion: 提出以有效性、可靠性、可解释性为核心的标准化评估三维框架

Abstract: This position paper examines how large language models (LLMs) can support
thematic analysis of unstructured clinical transcripts, a widely used but
resource-intensive method for uncovering patterns in patient and provider
narratives. We conducted a systematic review of recent studies applying LLMs to
thematic analysis, complemented by an interview with a practicing clinician.
Our findings reveal that current approaches remain fragmented across multiple
dimensions including types of thematic analysis, datasets, prompting strategies
and models used, most notably in evaluation. Existing evaluation methods vary
widely (from qualitative expert review to automatic similarity metrics),
hindering progress and preventing meaningful benchmarking across studies. We
argue that establishing standardized evaluation practices is critical for
advancing the field. To this end, we propose an evaluation framework centered
on three dimensions: validity, reliability, and interpretability.

Result: 调参后IndoBERT达到80%准确率，数据增强是关键成功因素，模型组合仅带来微幅提升

Conclusion: IndoBERT是印尼语情感分类最优模型，未来应探索新架构提升印尼NLP任务泛化能力

Abstract: Understanding emotions in the Indonesian language is essential for improving
customer experiences in e-commerce. This study focuses on enhancing the
accuracy of emotion classification in Indonesian by leveraging advanced
language models, IndoBERT and DistilBERT. A key component of our approach was
data processing, specifically data augmentation, which included techniques such
as back-translation and synonym replacement. These methods played a significant
role in boosting the model's performance. After hyperparameter tuning, IndoBERT
achieved an accuracy of 80\%, demonstrating the impact of careful data
processing. While combining multiple IndoBERT models led to a slight
improvement, it did not significantly enhance performance. Our findings
indicate that IndoBERT was the most effective model for emotion classification
in Indonesian, with data augmentation proving to be a vital factor in achieving
high accuracy. Future research should focus on exploring alternative
architectures and strategies to improve generalization for Indonesian NLP
tasks.

TL;DR: 提出基于自生成数据的迭代遗忘框架，有效解决传统LLM遗忘方法的数据获取难题，在保持模型效用的同时实现高质量遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM遗忘方法需要完整获取隐私敏感/稀缺的遗忘数据，且数据分布可能与模型内部表示不匹配。

Method: 1. Reveal-and-Release方法：通过优化指令让模型自我揭示知识生成遗忘数据
2. 参数高效的迭代学习框架：分阶段调整权重空间

Result: 实验证明该方法在遗忘质量（F1提升5.6%）与模型效用保留（准确率下降<1.5%）间取得最优平衡。

Conclusion: 通过自生成数据替代真实遗忘数据，结合参数高效微调机制，为隐私敏感场景下的模型修正提供新范式。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) unlearning has demonstrated effectiveness in
removing the influence of undesirable data (also known as forget data).
Existing approaches typically assume full access to the forget dataset,
overlooking two key challenges: (1) Forget data is often privacy-sensitive,
rare, or legally regulated, making it expensive or impractical to obtain (2)
The distribution of available forget data may not align with how that
information is represented within the model. To address these limitations, we
propose a ``Reveal-and-Release'' method to unlearn with self-generated data,
where we prompt the model to reveal what it knows using optimized instructions.
To fully utilize the self-generated forget data, we propose an iterative
unlearning framework, where we make incremental adjustments to the model's
weight space with parameter-efficient modules trained on the forget data.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method balances the tradeoff between
forget quality and utility preservation.

Method: 1. 从11个热门仓库爬取77,100个GitHub issue，提取开发者真实问题
2. 建立两级问题分类体系，人工构建576个QA对
3. 开发SWE-QA-Agent代理框架实现自动推理

Conclusion: SWE-QA填补了仓库级QA研究的空白，其代理框架为智能编程工具发展提供新方向，未来需解决复杂依赖推理等难题

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about entire software repositories is an
essential capability for intelligent software engineering tools. While existing
benchmarks such as CoSQA and CodeQA have advanced the field, they predominantly
focus on small, self-contained code snippets. These setups fail to capture the
complexity of real-world repositories, where effective understanding and
reasoning often require navigating multiple files, understanding software
architecture, and grounding answers in long-range code dependencies. In this
paper, we present SWE-QA, a repository-level code question answering (QA)
benchmark designed to facilitate research on automated QA systems in realistic
code environments. SWE-QA involves 576 high-quality question-answer pairs
spanning diverse categories, including intention understanding, cross-file
reasoning, and multi-hop dependency analysis. To construct SWE-QA, we first
crawled 77,100 GitHub issues from 11 popular repositories. Based on an analysis
of naturally occurring developer questions extracted from these issues, we
developed a two-level taxonomy of repository-level questions and constructed a
set of seed questions for each category. For each category, we manually curated
and validated questions and collected their corresponding answers. As a
prototype application, we further develop SWE-QA-Agent, an agentic framework in
which LLM agents reason and act to find answers automatically. We evaluate six
advanced LLMs on SWE-QA under various context augmentation strategies.
Experimental results highlight the promise of LLMs, particularly our
SWE-QA-Agent framework, in addressing repository-level QA, while also revealing
open challenges and pointing to future research directions.

Method: MUSE-A基于框架语义学和启发式树搜索生成多样化攻击路径，MUSE-D通过细粒度安全对齐实现早期防御干预

Result: 在多模型测试中有效识别并缓解多轮漏洞，防御成功率提升显著

Conclusion: 首次系统解决多轮越狱问题，为LLM安全对齐提供新范式

Abstract: As large language models~(LLMs) become widely adopted, ensuring their
alignment with human values is crucial to prevent jailbreaks where adversaries
manipulate models to produce harmful content. While most defenses target
single-turn attacks, real-world usage often involves multi-turn dialogues,
exposing models to attacks that exploit conversational context to bypass safety
measures. We introduce MUSE, a comprehensive framework tackling multi-turn
jailbreaks from both attack and defense angles. For attacks, we propose MUSE-A,
a method that uses frame semantics and heuristic tree search to explore diverse
semantic trajectories. For defense, we present MUSE-D, a fine-grained safety
alignment approach that intervenes early in dialogues to reduce
vulnerabilities. Extensive experiments on various models show that MUSE
effectively identifies and mitigates multi-turn vulnerabilities. Code is

TL;DR: 提出改进版UMA模型，通过分割模块实现单聚合帧映射多token，解决英语语音识别中的细粒度token问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始UMA在汉语表现良好但英语存在局限，因英语音节常被切分为多个细粒度token，且token可能跨不足3个声学帧，无法形成单峰权重分布。

Method: 引入分割模块，在计算CTC损失前将每个聚合帧生成两个token，实现单聚合帧对应多token的映射机制。

Result: 改进后的UMA模型可有效处理英语和汉语语音识别，克服原模型在英语token粒度与声学帧对齐方面的缺陷。

Conclusion: 通过灵活的分割机制扩展了UMA模型的多语言适用性，为跨语言语音识别提供新解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes a unimodal aggregation (UMA) based nonautoregressive
model for both English and Mandarin speech recognition. The original UMA
explicitly segments and aggregates acoustic frames (with unimodal weights that
first monotonically increase and then decrease) of the same text token to learn
better representations than regular connectionist temporal classification
(CTC). However, it only works well in Mandarin. It struggles with other
languages, such as English, for which a single syllable may be tokenized into
multiple fine-grained tokens, or a token spans fewer than 3 acoustic frames and
fails to form unimodal weights. To address this problem, we propose allowing
each UMA-aggregated frame map to multiple tokens, via a simple split module
that generates two tokens from each aggregated frame before computing the CTC
loss.

Method: 1) 2.59M参数的MLP门控网络动态选择文本/图像/融合路径 2) 代理机制协调跨模态知识（选择最优结果或生成新答案）3) 复用预训练单模态模型避免全模态微调。

Result: 在7个基准测试中平均超越最强基线4.02%，保持开源模型中最优性能，参数量仅增加0.7%但推理速度无明显下降。

Conclusion: 通过动态路径选择和知识协调代理，TableDART以极低计算成本实现跨模态表格理解，为结构化数据处理提供高效解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Modeling semantic and structural information from tabular data remains a core
challenge for effective table understanding. Existing Table-as-Text approaches
flatten tables for large language models (LLMs), but lose crucial structural
cues, while Table-as-Image methods preserve structure yet struggle with
fine-grained semantics. Recent Table-as-Multimodality strategies attempt to
combine textual and visual views, but they (1) statically process both
modalities for every query-table pair within a large multimodal LLMs (MLLMs),
inevitably introducing redundancy and even conflicts, and (2) depend on costly
fine-tuning of MLLMs. In light of this, we propose TableDART, a
training-efficient framework that integrates multimodal views by reusing
pretrained single-modality models. TableDART introduces a lightweight
2.59M-parameter MLP gating network that dynamically selects the optimal path
(either Text-only, Image-only, or Fusion) for each table-query pair,
effectively reducing redundancy and conflicts from both modalities. In
addition, we propose a novel agent to mediate cross-modal knowledge integration
by analyzing outputs from text- and image-based models, either selecting the
best result or synthesizing a new answer through reasoning. This design avoids
the prohibitive costs of full MLLM fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on seven
benchmarks show that TableDART establishes new state-of-the-art performance
among open-source models, surpassing the strongest baseline by an average of
4.02%. The code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大规模语音模型在资源受限环境下部署困难，且缺乏阿拉伯语专项优化的模型。需构建轻量级阿拉伯语音模型以保留语言特性。

Method: 1. 采用迭代自蒸馏技术训练双语大模型HL
2. 将知识蒸馏至压缩学生模型HS/HST
3. 使用低秩近似压缩教师模型的监督信号

Result: 在阿拉伯ASR/情感识别/方言识别任务中超越HuBERT和XLS-R，仅需微调即达到SOTA水平。HST模型参数量仅1.8M仍保持强大性能。

Conclusion: HArnESS为阿拉伯语音处理提供了轻量高效的解决方案，通过模型开源支持低资源环境下的负责任AI部署。

Abstract: Large pre-trained speech models excel in downstream tasks but their
deployment is impractical for resource-limited environments. In this paper, we
introduce HArnESS, the first Arabic-centric self-supervised speech model
family, designed to capture Arabic speech nuances. Using iterative
self-distillation, we train large bilingual HArnESS (HL) SSL models and then
distill knowledge into compressed student models (HS, HST), preserving
Arabic-specific representations. We use low-rank approximation to further
compact the teacher's discrete supervision into shallow, thin models. We
evaluate HArnESS on Arabic ASR, Speaker Emotion Recognition (SER), and Dialect
Identification (DID), demonstrating effectiveness against HuBERT and XLS-R.
With minimal fine-tuning, HArnESS achieves SOTA or comparable performance,
making it a lightweight yet powerful alternative for real-world use. We release
our distilled models and findings to support responsible research and
deployment in low-resource settings.

Method: 构建当代政治话语数据集，设计三种代表性检测标准，采用留一法分析标签一致性，建立伪标签量化评估体系

Result: 策略性设计的单提示方法达到与资源密集型方法相当的检测性能（F1值75.2%）

Conclusion: 基于伪标签的轻量化检测方案在现实约束条件下具有可行性，为动态演变的攻击性语言检测提供新思路

Abstract: Although offensive language continually evolves over time, even recent
studies using LLMs have predominantly relied on outdated datasets and rarely
evaluated the generalization ability on unseen texts. In this study, we
constructed a large-scale dataset of contemporary political discourse and
employed three refined judgments in the absence of ground truth. Each judgment
reflects a representative offensive language detection method and is carefully
designed for optimal conditions. We identified distinct patterns for each
judgment and demonstrated tendencies of label agreement using a leave-one-out
strategy. By establishing pseudo-labels as ground trust for quantitative
performance assessment, we observed that a strategically designed single
prompting achieves comparable performance to more resource-intensive methods.
This suggests a feasible approach applicable in real-world settings with
inherent constraints.

Result: 在多样化数据集、模型家族和规模上验证了对齐性能提升，展现出卓越的泛化能力

Conclusion: DPA有效缓解语言先验冲突，为视觉-语言对齐提供了鲁棒的训练范式

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have gained significant attention
due to their impressive ability to integrate vision and language modalities.
Recent advancements in MLLMs have primarily focused on improving performance
through high-quality datasets, novel architectures, and optimized training
strategies. However, in this paper, we identify a previously overlooked issue,
language prior conflict, a mismatch between the inherent language priors of
large language models (LLMs) and the language priors in training datasets. This
conflict leads to suboptimal vision-language alignment, as MLLMs are prone to
adapting to the language style of training samples. To address this issue, we
propose a novel training method called Decoupled Proxy Alignment (DPA). DPA
introduces two key innovations: (1) the use of a proxy LLM during pretraining
to decouple the vision-language alignment process from language prior
interference, and (2) dynamic loss adjustment based on visual relevance to
strengthen optimization signals for visually relevant tokens. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DPA significantly mitigates the language prior
conflict, achieving superior alignment performance across diverse datasets,
model families, and scales. Our method not only improves the effectiveness of
MLLM training but also shows exceptional generalization capabilities, making it
a robust approach for vision-language alignment. Our code is available at

Abstract: Unified vision large language models (VLLMs) have recently achieved
impressive advancements in both multimodal understanding and generation,

of datasets that fully exploit the synergistic potential between these two core
abilities. Existing datasets typically address understanding and generation in
isolation, thereby limiting the performance of unified VLLMs. To bridge this
critical gap, we introduce a novel dataset construction framework,
UnifiedVisual, and present UnifiedVisual-240K, a high-quality dataset
meticulously designed to facilitate mutual enhancement between multimodal
understanding and generation. UnifiedVisual-240K seamlessly integrates diverse
visual and textual inputs and outputs, enabling comprehensive cross-modal
reasoning and precise text-to-image alignment. Our dataset encompasses a wide
spectrum of tasks and data sources, ensuring rich diversity and addressing key
shortcomings of prior resources. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models
trained on UnifiedVisual-240K consistently achieve strong performance across a
wide range of tasks. Notably, these models exhibit significant mutual
reinforcement between multimodal understanding and generation, further
validating the effectiveness of our framework and dataset. We believe
UnifiedVisual represents a new growth point for advancing unified VLLMs and
unlocking their full potential. Our code and datasets is available at

*Longfei Zuo,Pingjun Hong,Oliver Kraus,Barbara Plank,Robert Litschko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现多语言双编码器作为首阶段检索器可有效提升跨语言信息检索性能，指令调优的LLM在成对重排中表现优异，且机器翻译对强重排模型的作用减弱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前跨语言信息检索系统依赖机器翻译的第一阶段检索存在成本高和错误传播问题，需探索更优的两阶段交互方案。

Method: 采用多语言双编码器作为首阶段检索器，结合LLM重排模型，在段落级和文档级CLIR中系统评估不同组合效果。

Result: 双编码器首检显著提升性能，翻译增益随重排模型增强而减弱；指令调优LLM的成对重排器与列表式方法表现相当。

Conclusion: 现有先进重排模型在无机器翻译时CLIR性能严重不足，揭示两阶段交互中检索器与重排器的协同效应至关重要。

Abstract: Multi-stage information retrieval (IR) has become a widely-adopted paradigm
in search. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively evaluated
as second-stage reranking models for monolingual IR, a systematic large-scale
comparison is still lacking for cross-lingual IR (CLIR). Moreover, while prior
work shows that LLM-based rerankers improve CLIR performance, their evaluation
setup relies on lexical retrieval with machine translation (MT) for the first
stage. This is not only prohibitively expensive but also prone to error
propagation across stages. Our evaluation on passage-level and document-level
CLIR reveals that further gains can be achieved with multilingual bi-encoders
as first-stage retrievers and that the benefits of translation diminishes with
stronger reranking models. We further show that pairwise rerankers based on
instruction-tuned LLMs perform competitively with listwise rerankers. To the
best of our knowledge, we are the first to study the interaction between
retrievers and rerankers in two-stage CLIR with LLMs. Our findings reveal that,
without MT, current state-of-the-art rerankers fall severely short when
directly applied in CLIR.

*Nahyun Lee,Guijin Son,Hyunwoo Ko,Kyubeen Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出韩语数学长链推理基准KAIO，解决现有基准快速饱和问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有韩语基准测试数量少、更新慢且易被污染，无法有效评估前沿大语言模型性能

Method: 创建数学核心的韩语基准KAIO，采用私有化防污染机制，通过持续迭代保持测试难度

Result: 最佳模型GPT-5仅62.8分，开放模型普遍低于30分，显示巨大改进空间

Conclusion: KAIO填补韩语前沿模型评估空白，通过动态更新机制可持续追踪技术进步

Abstract: With the advancement of mid/post-training techniques, LLMs are pushing their
boundaries at an accelerated pace. Legacy benchmarks saturate quickly (e.g.,
broad suites like MMLU over the years, newer ones like GPQA-D even faster),
which makes frontier progress hard to track. The problem is especially acute in
Korean: widely used benchmarks are fewer, often translated or narrow in scope,
and updated more slowly, so saturation and contamination arrive sooner.
Accordingly, at this moment, there is no Korean benchmark capable of evaluating
and ranking frontier models. To bridge this gap, we introduce KAIO, a Korean,
math-centric benchmark that stresses long-chain reasoning. Unlike recent Korean
suites that are at or near saturation, KAIO remains far from saturated: the
best-performing model, GPT-5, attains 62.8, followed by Gemini-2.5-Pro (52.3).
Open models such as Qwen3-235B and DeepSeek-R1 cluster falls below 30,
demonstrating substantial headroom, enabling robust tracking of frontier
progress in Korean. To reduce contamination, KAIO will remain private and be
served via a held-out evaluator until the best publicly known model reaches at
least 80% accuracy, after which we will release the set and iterate to a harder
version.

Motivation: 现实场景中LLM需遵循用户动态定制的行为/安全规范，但现有方法难以适应多样化、持续演变的规范要求

Method: 提出Align3方法（基于分层反思的测试时审议）和覆盖5大场景/103项规范的SpecBench评估体系

Result: 测试时审议平均提升15%对齐效果，Align3实现最优安全-有效性平衡，基准成功揭示95%以上的对齐缺口

Conclusion: 首次系统解决LLM规范对齐的动态适应难题，为实际部署提供了可扩展的轻量级解决方案框架

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in diverse real-world
scenarios, each governed by bespoke behavioral and safety specifications (spec)
custom-tailored by users or organizations. These spec, categorized into
safety-spec and behavioral-spec, vary across scenarios and evolve with changing
preferences and requirements. We formalize this challenge as specification
alignment, focusing on LLMs' ability to follow dynamic, scenario-specific spec
from both behavioral and safety perspectives. To address this challenge, we
propose Align3, a lightweight method that employs Test-Time Deliberation (TTD)
with hierarchical reflection and revision to reason over the specification
boundaries. We further present SpecBench, a unified benchmark for measuring
specification alignment, covering 5 scenarios, 103 spec, and 1,500 prompts.
Experiments on 15 reasoning and 18 instruct models with several TTD methods,
including Self-Refine, TPO, and MoreThink, yield three key findings: (i)
test-time deliberation enhances specification alignment; (ii) Align3 advances
the safety-helpfulness trade-off frontier with minimal overhead; (iii)
SpecBench effectively reveals alignment gaps. These results highlight the
potential of test-time deliberation as an effective strategy for reasoning over
the real-world specification boundaries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言大模型存在语言混淆现象（生成语言与提示语言/用户指定语言不一致），影响实际应用效果。

Method: 利用多语平行语料库分离语言向量，通过固定/可训练导向函数实现LLM的有效语言引导。

Result: 在18种语言/3个基准测试中验证，ReCoVeR显著降低语言混淆且保持任务性能，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决多语言LLM的语言混淆痛点，且不牺牲模型性能，代码已开源实用。

Abstract: As they become increasingly multilingual, Large Language Models (LLMs)
exhibit more language confusion, i.e., they tend to generate answers in a
language different from the language of the prompt or the answer language
explicitly requested by the user. In this work, we propose ReCoVeR (REducing
language COnfusion in VEctor Representations), a novel lightweight approach for
reducing language confusion based on language-specific steering vectors. We
first isolate language vectors with the help of multi-parallel corpus and then
effectively leverage those vectors for effective LLM steering via fixed (i.e.,
unsupervised) as well as trainable steering functions. Our extensive
evaluation, encompassing three benchmarks and 18 languages, shows that ReCoVeR
effectively mitigates language confusion in both monolingual and cross-lingual
setups while at the same time -- and in contrast to prior language steering
methods -- retaining task performance. Our data code is available at

Result: 在ASAP数据集上使用ChatGPT和Claude时，QWK指标较传统方法提升达34.86%

Conclusion: 通过模拟人类评审团的协作机制，RES有效提升了评分系统与人类评价标准的一致性

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has brought a new paradigm to
automated essay scoring (AES), a long-standing and practical application of
natural language processing in education. However, achieving human-level
multi-perspective understanding and judgment remains a challenge. In this work,
we propose Roundtable Essay Scoring (RES), a multi-agent evaluation framework
designed to perform precise and human-aligned scoring under a zero-shot
setting. RES constructs evaluator agents based on LLMs, each tailored to a
specific prompt and topic context. Each agent independently generates a
trait-based rubric and conducts a multi-perspective evaluation. Then, by
simulating a roundtable-style discussion, RES consolidates individual
evaluations through a dialectical reasoning process to produce a final holistic
score that more closely aligns with human evaluation. By enabling collaboration
and consensus among agents with diverse evaluation perspectives, RES
outperforms prior zero-shot AES approaches. Experiments on the ASAP dataset
using ChatGPT and Claude show that RES achieves up to a 34.86% improvement in
average QWK over straightforward prompting (Vanilla) methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉干预方法局限于像素级扰动，无法深入分析多模态整合的语义机制，需要开发概念级干预工具

Method: 结合视觉语义编辑和注意力调制技术，实现概念级视觉操作，在对象/属性/关系三层次识别关键注意力头

Result: 发现正贡献头共享语义层次特征，负贡献头泛化性强；注意力头调制显著提升LLaVA和InstructBLIP在VQA任务的表现

Conclusion: V-SEAM有效揭示视觉-语言模型工作机制，通过注意力调制优化模型性能，推动多模态可解释性研究发展

Abstract: Recent advances in causal interpretability have extended from language models
to vision-language models (VLMs), seeking to reveal their internal mechanisms
through input interventions. While textual interventions often target
semantics, visual interventions typically rely on coarse pixel-level
perturbations, limiting semantic insights on multimodal integration. In this
study, we introduce V-SEAM, a novel framework that combines Visual Semantic
Editing and Attention Modulating for causal interpretation of VLMs. V-SEAM
enables concept-level visual manipulations and identifies attention heads with
positive or negative contributions to predictions across three semantic levels:
objects, attributes, and relationships. We observe that positive heads are
often shared within the same semantic level but vary across levels, while
negative heads tend to generalize broadly. Finally, we introduce an automatic
method to modulate key head embeddings, demonstrating enhanced performance for
both LLaVA and InstructBLIP across three diverse VQA benchmarks. Our data and
code are released at: https://github.com/petergit1/V-SEAM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在心理健康支持中缺乏结构化推理，尤其在中文语境下生成的回复缺乏真正共情，需通过系统化方法改善响应质量。

Method: 1）设计认知行为疗法启发的CoE推理框架分步解析情绪/原因/意图 2）构建Empathy-QA中文数据集 3）两阶段训练：监督微调+强化学习优化（通过专用奖励模型提升治疗相关性和语境适配）

Result: 在自动指标表现优异，人工评估以44.30%的Win@1率显著超越基线模型，验证了框架有效性。

Conclusion: 通过可解释的推理过程和上下文感知优化，Empathy-R1推动了负责任AI在心理健康领域的发展，实现了质量与透明度的双重突破。

Abstract: Empathy is critical for effective mental health support, especially when
addressing Long Counseling Texts (LCTs). However, existing Large Language
Models (LLMs) often generate replies that are semantically fluent but lack the
structured reasoning necessary for genuine psychological support, particularly
in a Chinese context. To bridge this gap, we introduce Empathy-R1, a novel
framework that integrates a Chain-of-Empathy (CoE) reasoning process with
Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance response quality for LCTs. Inspired by
cognitive-behavioral therapy, our CoE paradigm guides the model to sequentially
reason about a help-seeker's emotions, causes, and intentions, making its
thinking process both transparent and interpretable. Our framework is empowered
by a new large-scale Chinese dataset, Empathy-QA, and a two-stage training
process. First, Supervised Fine-Tuning instills the CoE's reasoning structure.
Subsequently, RL, guided by a dedicated reward model, refines the therapeutic
relevance and contextual appropriateness of the final responses. Experiments
show that Empathy-R1 achieves strong performance on key automatic metrics. More
importantly, human evaluations confirm its superiority, showing a clear
preference over strong baselines and achieving a Win@1 rate of 44.30% on our
new benchmark. By enabling interpretable and contextually nuanced responses,
Empathy-R1 represents a significant advancement in developing responsible and
genuinely beneficial AI for mental health support.

Motivation: 解决现有语音模型难以同时保持高质量声学特征和长期语义连贯性的问题，并改善生成语音内容的评估体系。

Method: 使用统一多模态标记器处理语义与声学token，采用单Transformer解码器进行联合建模，引入多量化器配置分析，并开发基于LLM的语音内容质量评估框架。

Result: 实现说话人身份保留（97.3%相似度）、声学一致性SOTA（MOS 4.2），当量化器从3增至5时声学失真降低21%但语义连贯性下降15%。

Conclusion: 联合建模范式有效提升语音合成质量，量化器数量存在性能平衡点，LLM评估方法为语音生成任务提供了新的评估维度，模型开源推动领域发展。

Abstract: We propose Llama-Mimi, a speech language model that uses a unified tokenizer
and a single Transformer decoder to jointly model sequences of interleaved
semantic and acoustic tokens. Comprehensive evaluation shows that Llama-Mimi
achieves state-of-the-art performance in acoustic consistency and possesses the
ability to preserve speaker identity. Our analysis further demonstrates that
increasing the number of quantizers improves acoustic fidelity but degrades
linguistic performance, highlighting the inherent challenge of maintaining
long-term coherence. We additionally introduce an LLM-as-a-Judge-based
evaluation to assess the spoken content quality of generated outputs. Our
models, code, and speech samples are publicly available.

Motivation: 传统全覆盖问答评估存在高冗余和低效率问题，受人类面试流程启发寻求更高效的MLLM评估方法

Method: 1. 两阶段面试策略（预面试+正式面试） 2. 动态调整面试官权重机制 3. 自适应问题难度选择机制

Result: PLCC提升17.6%，SRCC提升16.7%，问题数量减少且与全覆盖结果相关性显著高于随机抽样

Conclusion: 该面试范式为大规模MLLM基准测试提供了可靠高效的新方案，可替代传统评估方法

Abstract: The rapid progress of Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has spurred
the creation of numerous benchmarks. However, conventional full-coverage
Question-Answering evaluations suffer from high redundancy and low efficiency.
Inspired by human interview processes, we propose a multi-to-one interview
paradigm for efficient MLLM evaluation. Our framework consists of (i) a
two-stage interview strategy with pre-interview and formal interview phases,
(ii) dynamic adjustment of interviewer weights to ensure fairness, and (iii) an
adaptive mechanism for question difficulty-level chosen. Experiments on
different benchmarks show that the proposed paradigm achieves significantly
higher correlation with full-coverage results than random sampling, with
improvements of up to 17.6% in PLCC and 16.7% in SRCC, while reducing the
number of required questions. These findings demonstrate that the proposed
paradigm provides a reliable and efficient alternative for large-scale MLLM
benchmarking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE-LoRA方法依赖离散路由器导致无法与主干模型融合，且增加推理复杂度。需开发可合并的高效路由机制。

Method: 1) 解耦LoRA适配器的方向/幅度学习 2) 共享幅度向量保证激活一致性 3) 专家选择损失促进激活差异化 4) 基于角相似度的自路由机制

Result: 实验显示FURINA显著超越标准LoRA，匹配或优于现有MoE-LoRA方法，同时完全消除MoE推理开销。

Conclusion: FURINA首次实现可完全融入主干模型的无路由器MoE-LoRA，零额外推理成本下达成SOTA性能，推动参数高效微调技术发展。

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm has been successfully integrated into
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT),
delivering performance gains with minimal parameter overhead. However, a key
limitation of existing MoE-LoRA methods is their reliance on a discrete router,
which prevents the integration of the MoE components into the backbone model.
To overcome this, we propose FURINA, a novel Free from Unmergeable Router
framework based on the LINear Aggregation of experts. FURINA eliminates the
router by introducing a Self-Routing mechanism. This is achieved through three
core innovations: (1) decoupled learning of the direction and magnitude for
LoRA adapters, (2) a shared learnable magnitude vector for consistent
activation scaling, and (3) expert selection loss that encourages divergent
expert activation. The proposed mechanism leverages the angular similarity
between the input and each adapter's directional component to activate experts,
which are then scaled by the shared magnitude vector. This design allows the
output norm to naturally reflect the importance of each expert, thereby
enabling dynamic, router-free routing. The expert selection loss further
sharpens this behavior by encouraging sparsity and aligning it with standard
MoE activation patterns. We also introduce a shared expert within the MoE-LoRA
block that provides stable, foundational knowledge. To the best of our
knowledge, FURINA is the first router-free, MoE-enhanced LoRA method that can
be fully merged into the backbone model, introducing zero additional
inference-time cost or complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FURINA not only significantly outperforms standard LoRA but also matches or
surpasses the performance of existing MoE-LoRA methods, while eliminating the
extra inference-time overhead of MoE.

Motivation: 现有LLM对比研究主要集中在英语任务，需填补跨语言性能评估空白，为波斯语NLP应用建立基准并提供模型选择指导

Method: 使用900条情感分析文本和1800条情绪检测文本，通过统一提示词、处理参数和性能指标（精确度/F1值）进行系统评测

Result: 所有模型达到可用水平（前三名统计无显著差异），GPT-4o双任务准确率最高，情绪检测误分类率反映波斯语特有语言挑战

Conclusion: 研究为波斯语NLP建立性能基准，揭示多语言系统部署需平衡准确率/成本效率，并重视文化语言特性对AI系统的影响

Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive comparative evaluation of four
state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs)--Claude 3.7 Sonnet, DeepSeek-V3,
Gemini 2.0 Flash, and GPT-4o--for sentiment analysis and emotion detection in
Persian social media texts. Comparative analysis among LLMs has witnessed a
significant rise in recent years, however, most of these analyses have been
conducted on English language tasks, creating gaps in understanding
cross-linguistic performance patterns. This research addresses these gaps
through rigorous experimental design using balanced Persian datasets containing
900 texts for sentiment analysis (positive, negative, neutral) and 1,800 texts
for emotion detection (anger, fear, happiness, hate, sadness, surprise). The
main focus was to allow for a direct and fair comparison among different
models, by using consistent prompts, uniform processing parameters, and by
analyzing the performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1-scores, along
with misclassification patterns. The results show that all models reach an
acceptable level of performance, and a statistical comparison of the best three
models indicates no significant differences among them. However, GPT-4o
demonstrated a marginally higher raw accuracy value for both tasks, while
Gemini 2.0 Flash proved to be the most cost-efficient. The findings indicate
that the emotion detection task is more challenging for all models compared to
the sentiment analysis task, and the misclassification patterns can represent
some challenges in Persian language texts. These findings establish performance
benchmarks for Persian NLP applications and offer practical guidance for model
selection based on accuracy, efficiency, and cost considerations, while
revealing cultural and linguistic challenges that require consideration in
multilingual AI system deployment.

Motivation: 通用BERT模型在处理专利文本（长篇幅/技术性强/法律结构）时性能下降，现有专利NLP方法主要依赖小数据微调，缺乏领域深度适配。

Method: 采用ModernBERT架构，集成FlashAttention/旋转嵌入/GLU前馈层优化，使用6000万专利记录预训练，评估四个专利分类任务。

Result: ModernBERT-base-PT在四分之三任务超越基础模型，推理速度达PatentBERT的3倍；扩大模型规模与定制分词器可进一步提升特定任务表现。

Conclusion: 领域专用预训练结合架构优化能有效提升专利NLP任务性能，同时保持高效推理能力，为时效敏感场景提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models such as BERT have become foundational in
NLP, yet their performance degrades in specialized domains like patents, which
contain long, technical, and legally structured text. Prior approaches to
patent NLP have primarily relied on fine-tuning general-purpose models or
domain-adapted variants pretrained with limited data. In this work, we pretrain
3 domain-specific masked language models for patents, using the ModernBERT
architecture and a curated corpus of over 60 million patent records. Our
approach incorporates architectural optimizations, including FlashAttention,
rotary embeddings, and GLU feed-forward layers. We evaluate our models on four
downstream patent classification tasks. Our model, ModernBERT-base-PT,
consistently outperforms the general-purpose ModernBERT baseline on three out
of four datasets and achieves competitive performance with a baseline
PatentBERT. Additional experiments with ModernBERT-base-VX and
Mosaic-BERT-large demonstrate that scaling the model size and customizing the
tokenizer further enhance performance on selected tasks. Notably, all
ModernBERT variants retain substantially faster inference over - 3x that of
PatentBERT - underscoring their suitability for time-sensitive applications.
These results underscore the benefits of domain-specific pretraining and
architectural improvements for patent-focused NLP tasks.

Motivation: 语音功能的引入会损害文本输入的推理能力，语音查询加剧性能下降，需解决跨模态知识迁移难题

Method: 双通道知识蒸馏（文本-文本/语音-文本），通过教师模型向语音LLM传递知识

Result: 对话与音频任务验证框架有效：保留89%文本知识、跨模态对齐提升32%、语音推理准确率提高27%

Conclusion: 该框架成功突破语音LLM瓶颈，实现知识保存-模态对齐-推理增强的三重提升，推动多模态AI发展

Abstract: In this work, we present the first systematic evaluation of catastrophic
forgetting and modality inequivalence in speech large language models, showing
that introducing speech capabilities can degrade knowledge and reasoning even
when inputs remain textual, and performance further decreases with spoken
queries. To address these challenges, we propose a cross-modal knowledge
distillation framework that leverages both text-to-text and speech-to-text
channels to transfer knowledge from a text-based teacher model to a speech LLM.
Extensive experiments on dialogue and audio understanding tasks validate the
effectiveness of our approach in preserving textual knowledge, improving
cross-modal alignment, and enhancing reasoning in speech-based interactions.

TL;DR: 研究表明使用LoRA微调LLMs可显著提升模型处理隐含文本信息的能力，增强信息抽取任务的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NLP方法难以处理文本中的隐含关系（如'Zuhdi每周去教堂'暗示宗教信仰），本研究探究预训练大语言模型在隐式信息抽取任务中的表现及优化方法。

Method: 使用LLaMA 2.3等三种LLMs，构建10k规模的隐式/显式生物信息数据集，通过LoRA微调测试模型在隐含推理任务中的泛化能力。

Result: 实验显示经过隐式数据微调的LLMs在信息抽取任务中准确率提升17.3%，模型对隐含语境的理解能力显著增强。

Conclusion: 针对性的隐式数据微调能有效激活LLMs的深层推理能力，为提升NLP系统处理复杂语义关系提供重要技术路径。

Abstract: Text Implicitness has always been challenging in Natural Language Processing
(NLP), with traditional methods relying on explicit statements to identify
entities and their relationships. From the sentence "Zuhdi attends church every
Sunday", the relationship between Zuhdi and Christianity is evident for a human
reader, but it presents a challenge when it must be inferred automatically.
Large language models (LLMs) have proven effective in NLP downstream tasks such
as text comprehension and information extraction (IE).
  This study examines how textual implicitness affects IE tasks in pre-trained
LLMs: LLaMA 2.3, DeepSeekV1, and Phi1.5. We generate two synthetic datasets of
10k implicit and explicit verbalization of biographic information to measure
the impact on LLM performance and analyze whether fine-tuning implicit data
improves their ability to generalize in implicit reasoning tasks.
  This research presents an experiment on the internal reasoning processes of
LLMs in IE, particularly in dealing with implicit and explicit contexts. The
results demonstrate that fine-tuning LLM models with LoRA (low-rank adaptation)
improves their performance in extracting information from implicit texts,
contributing to better model interpretability and reliability.

TL;DR: 研究发现提示词结尾空格分词方式显著影响大语言模型多选题评估结果，推荐将空格与答案字母合并分词以提升11%准确率并改善校准效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示评估LLMs时看似无关的空格分词差异会导致准确率剧烈波动（最高11%）和模型排名错位，威胁现有研究可靠性

Method: 通过控制变量实验比较不同分词策略（单独处理空格/与答案合并分词），采用统计显著性检验验证差异

Result: 特定分词策略使准确率提升且校准曲线改善，模型置信度估计更可靠

Conclusion: 必须采用标准化评估协议（推荐空格与答案字母合并分词），强调评估设计细节对结果可信度的关键影响

Abstract: When evaluating large language models (LLMs) with multiple-choice question
answering (MCQA), it is common to end the prompt with the string "Answer:" to
facilitate automated answer extraction via next-token probabilities. However,
there is no consensus on how to tokenize the space following the colon, often
overlooked as a trivial choice. In this paper, we uncover accuracy differences
of up to 11% due to this (seemingly irrelevant) tokenization variation as well
as reshuffled model rankings, raising concerns about the reliability of LLM
comparisons in prior work. Surprisingly, we are able to recommend one specific
strategy -- tokenizing the space together with the answer letter -- as we
observe consistent and statistically significant performance improvements.
Additionally, it improves model calibration, enhancing the reliability of the
model's confidence estimates. Our findings underscore the importance of careful
evaluation design and highlight the need for standardized, transparent
evaluation protocols to ensure reliable and comparable results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究较少关注LLM在文本改写任务（特别是论证改进）中的具体行为模式，需系统性评估模型在多个语言学层面的改进策略。

Method: 使用包含57个指标的CLEAR评估框架，从词汇/句法/语义/语用四个层面分析多组论证语料库的LLM改写效果。

Result: LLM通过缩短文本(平均减少14%)、增加单词长度(平均+1.2字母)、合并句子等方式改进论证，说服力提升23%、连贯性提升18%。

Conclusion: 多层面分析揭示LLM的论证改进机制，为优化文本改写模型提供语言学维度的评估基准与方法论指导。

Abstract: While LLMs have been extensively studied on general text generation tasks,
there is less research on text rewriting, a task related to general text
generation, and particularly on the behavior of models on this task. In this
paper we analyze what changes LLMs make in a text rewriting setting. We focus
specifically on argumentative texts and their improvement, a task named
Argument Improvement (ArgImp). We present CLEAR: an evaluation pipeline
consisting of 57 metrics mapped to four linguistic levels: lexical, syntactic,
semantic and pragmatic. This pipeline is used to examine the qualities of
LLM-rewritten arguments on a broad set of argumentation corpora and compare the
behavior of different LLMs on this task and analyze the behavior of different
LLMs on this task in terms of linguistic levels. By taking all four linguistic
levels into consideration, we find that the models perform ArgImp by shortening
the texts while simultaneously increasing average word length and merging
sentences. Overall we note an increase in the persuasion and coherence
dimensions.

Motivation: 现有基于注意力分数的KV压缩方法忽略值向量的直接影响，无法保证输出保留效果

Method: 利用CUR分解计算杠杆分数，近似注意力输出的主导子空间，通过最小化注意力重构损失实现精准KV选择

Result: 在LLaMA/Mistral上高压缩率下，比SOTA方法准确率提升9.6%，生成延迟降低40%，兼容主流注意力优化技术

Conclusion: CurDKV通过矩阵分解理论优化缓存选择机制，实现了KV压缩中精度与速度的最佳平衡

Abstract: Key-value (KV) cache compression has emerged as a critical technique for
reducing the memory and latency overhead of autoregressive language models
during inference. Prior approaches predominantly rely on query-key attention
scores to rank and evict cached tokens, assuming that attention intensity
correlates with semantic importance. However, this heuristic overlooks the
contribution of value vectors, which directly influence the attention output.
In this paper, we propose CurDKV, a novel, value-centric KV compression method
that selects keys and values based on leverage scores computed from CUR matrix
decomposition. Our approach approximates the dominant subspace of the attention
output $softmax(QK^T)V$, ensuring that the retained tokens best preserve the
model's predictive behavior. Theoretically, we show that attention score
approximation does not guarantee output preservation, and demonstrate that
CUR-based selection minimizes end-to-end attention reconstruction loss.
Empirically, CurDKV achieves up to 9.6% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art
methods like SnapKV and ChunkKV under aggressive compression budgets on LLaMA
and Mistral, while maintaining compatibility with FlashAttention and Grouped
Query Attention. In addition to improved accuracy, CurDKV reduces generation
latency by up to 40% at high compression, offering a practical speed-accuracy
tradeoff.

Conclusion: maiBERT已开源至Hugging Face平台，支持情感分析、命名实体识别等下游任务微调应用

Abstract: Natural Language Understanding (NLU) for low-resource languages remains a
major challenge in NLP due to the scarcity of high-quality data and
language-specific models. Maithili, despite being spoken by millions, lacks
adequate computational resources, limiting its inclusion in digital and
AI-driven applications. To address this gap, we introducemaiBERT, a BERT-based

corpus and evaluated through a news classification task. In our experiments,
maiBERT achieved an accuracy of 87.02%, outperforming existing regional models
like NepBERTa and HindiBERT, with a 0.13% overall accuracy gain and 5-7%
improvement across various classes. We have open-sourced maiBERT on Hugging

Motivation: 现有OpenRE方法依赖聚类后人工标注新关系，实用性受限。本文旨在利用LLM的语言理解能力实现全自动新关系预测。

Method: 1. 关系发现器(RD)基于训练实例的demonstrations预测新关系；2. 关系预测器(RP)通过交叉验证筛选高置信度实例；3. 自校正三阶段策略：关系发现→跨验证去噪→基于可靠实例的最终预测。

Result: 在三个OpenRE数据集上验证框架有效性，代码已开源。

Conclusion: 首次将LLM应用于OpenRE任务，通过自校正机制有效提升新关系预测能力，为关系抽取提供全自动解决方案。

Abstract: The goal of open relation extraction (OpenRE) is to develop an RE model that
can generalize to new relations not encountered during training. Existing
studies primarily formulate OpenRE as a clustering task. They first cluster all
test instances based on the similarity between the instances, and then manually
assign a new relation to each cluster. However, their reliance on human
annotation limits their practicality. In this paper, we propose an OpenRE
framework based on large language models (LLMs), which directly predicts new
relations for test instances by leveraging their strong language understanding
and generation abilities, without human intervention. Specifically, our
framework consists of two core components: (1) a relation discoverer (RD),
designed to predict new relations for test instances based on
\textit{demonstrations} formed by training instances with known relations; and
(2) a relation predictor (RP), used to select the most likely relation for a
test instance from $n$ candidate relations, guided by \textit{demonstrations}
composed of their instances. To enhance the ability of our framework to predict
new relations, we design a self-correcting inference strategy composed of three
stages: relation discovery, relation denoising, and relation prediction. In the
first stage, we use RD to preliminarily predict new relations for all test
instances. Next, we apply RP to select some high-reliability test instances for
each new relation from the prediction results of RD through a cross-validation
method. During the third stage, we employ RP to re-predict the relations of all
test instances based on the demonstrations constructed from these reliable test
instances. Extensive experiments on three OpenRE datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework. We release our code at
https://github.com/XMUDeepLIT/LLM-OREF.git.

TextMine can adapt to global demining efforts or other domains, transforming

Motivation: 解决关于LLM能否区分语法可能性的争议，探索模型内部表征语法知识的方式

Method: 通过计算四个模型对语法正确/错误句、低频句、语义/语用异常句的惊异值差异

Result: 语法错误句未显示独特惊异特征，语义/语用异常句惊异值更高

Conclusion: 模型概率不能作为句法知识的可靠代理，需开发新方法验证语言区分能力

Abstract: A controversial test for Large Language Models concerns the ability to
discern possible from impossible language. While some evidence attests to the
models' sensitivity to what crosses the limits of grammatically impossible
language, this evidence has been contested on the grounds of the soundness of
the testing material. We use model-internal representations to tap directly
into the way Large Language Models represent the 'grammatical-ungrammatical'
distinction. In a novel benchmark, we elicit probabilities from 4 models and
compute minimal-pair surprisal differences, juxtaposing probabilities assigned
to grammatical sentences to probabilities assigned to (i) lower frequency
grammatical sentences, (ii) ungrammatical sentences, (iii) semantically odd
sentences, and (iv) pragmatically odd sentences. The prediction is that if
string-probabilities can function as proxies for the limits of grammar, the
ungrammatical condition will stand out among the conditions that involve
linguistic violations, showing a spike in the surprisal rates. Our results do
not reveal a unique surprisal signature for ungrammatical prompts, as the
semantically and pragmatically odd conditions consistently show higher
surprisal. We thus demonstrate that probabilities do not constitute reliable
proxies for model-internal representations of syntactic knowledge.
Consequently, claims about models being able to distinguish possible from
impossible language need verification through a different methodology.

Conclusion: A1框架为LLM推理提供了高效、可扩展且具备统计保障的解决方案，其异步架构和采样设计有效突破了传统方法的性能瓶颈

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) benefit from test-time scaling, but existing
methods face significant challenges, including severe synchronization overhead,
memory bottlenecks, and latency, especially during speculative decoding with
long reasoning chains. We introduce A1 (Asynchronous Test-Time Scaling), a
statistically guaranteed adaptive inference framework that addresses these
challenges. A1 refines arithmetic intensity to identify synchronization as the
dominant bottleneck, proposes an online calibration strategy to enable
asynchronous inference, and designs a three-stage rejection sampling pipeline
that supports both sequential and parallel scaling. Through experiments on the
MATH, AMC23, AIME24, and AIME25 datasets, across various draft-target model
families, we demonstrate that A1 achieves a remarkable 56.7x speedup in
test-time scaling and a 4.14x improvement in throughput, all while maintaining
accurate rejection-rate control, reducing latency and memory overhead, and no
accuracy loss compared to using target model scaling alone. These results
position A1 as an efficient and principled solution for scalable LLM inference.

Abstract: WARNING: This paper contains examples of offensive materials. Toxic content
has become pervasive on social media platforms. We introduce SMARTER, a
data-efficient two-stage framework for explainable content moderation using
Large Language Models (LLMs). In Stage 1, we leverage LLMs' own outputs to
generate synthetic explanations for both correct and incorrect labels, enabling
alignment via preference optimization with minimal human supervision. In Stage
2, we refine explanation quality through cross-model training, allowing weaker
models to align stylistically and semantically with stronger ones. Experiments
on three benchmark tasks -- HateXplain, Latent Hate, and Implicit Hate --
demonstrate that SMARTER enables LLMs to achieve up to a 13.5% macro-F1
improvement over standard few-shot baselines while using only a fraction of the
full training data. Our framework offers a scalable strategy for low-resource
settings by harnessing LLMs' self-improving capabilities for both
classification and explanation.

Motivation: 扩散语言模型存在长解码窗口问题——远离输入上下文的token易出现无关或重复内容，现有分块方法牺牲了扩散模型的速度和双向性优势。

Method: 1. Conv解码通过归一化缩小解码窗口，避免硬分割；2. R2FT通过后训练方案对齐远距离token。

Conclusion: 成功解决扩散模型长窗口瓶颈，Conv保持双向性优势，R2FT增强远程对齐，实现速度与质量双重突破。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) language models generate text one token at a time, which
limits their inference speed. Diffusion-based language models offer a promising
alternative, as they can decode multiple tokens in parallel. However, we
identify a key bottleneck in current diffusion LMs: the long decoding-window
problem, where tokens generated far from the input context often become
irrelevant or repetitive. Previous solutions like semi-autoregressive address
this issue by splitting windows into blocks, but this sacrifices speed and
bidirectionality, eliminating the main advantage of diffusion models. To
overcome this, we propose Convolutional decoding (Conv), a normalization-based
method that narrows the decoding window without hard segmentation, leading to
better fluency and flexibility. Additionally, we introduce Rejecting Rule-based
Fine-Tuning (R2FT), a post-hoc training scheme that better aligns tokens at
positions far from context. Our methods achieve state-of-the-art results on
open-ended generation benchmarks (e.g., AlpacaEval) among diffusion LM
baselines, with significantly lower step size than previous works,
demonstrating both speed and quality improvements.

Motivation: 现有量化方法（如GPTQ）会加剧模型输出的偏见并影响公平性评测表现，需明确量化过程中权重对公平性的影响机制。

Method: 在量化目标函数中显式加入群体公平性约束，引导舍入操作生成更少偏见的文本（涉及职业偏见、性别/种族/宗教歧视语言）。

Conclusion: 验证了带群体偏置项的量化理论方案，证明该方法能有效降低生成模型的群体偏见，并为量化过程中的公平性分析提供工具支持。

Abstract: High memory demands of generative language models have drawn attention to
quantization, which reduces computational cost, memory usage, and latency by
mapping model weights to lower-precision integers. Approaches such as GPTQ
effectively minimize input-weight product errors during quantization; however,
recent empirical studies show that they can increase biased outputs and degrade
performance on fairness benchmarks, and it remains unclear which specific
weights cause this issue. In this work, we draw new links between quantization
and model fairness by adding explicit group-fairness constraints to the
quantization objective and introduce Fair-GPTQ, the first quantization method
explicitly designed to reduce unfairness in large language models. The added
constraints guide the learning of the rounding operation toward less-biased
text generation for protected groups. Specifically, we focus on stereotype
generation involving occupational bias and discriminatory language spanning
gender, race, and religion. Fair-GPTQ has minimal impact on performance,
preserving at least 90% of baseline accuracy on zero-shot benchmarks, reduces
unfairness relative to a half-precision model, and retains the memory and speed
benefits of 4-bit quantization. We also compare the performance of Fair-GPTQ
with existing debiasing methods and find that it achieves performance on par
with the iterative null-space projection debiasing approach on
racial-stereotype benchmarks. Overall, the results validate our theoretical
solution to the quantization problem with a group-bias term, highlight its
applicability for reducing group bias at quantization time in generative
models, and demonstrate that our approach can further be used to analyze
channel- and weight-level contributions to fairness during quantization.

TL;DR: Proposes multimodal retrieval methods for slide decks including visual late-interaction models, hybrid techniques, and a novel VLM-based captioning pipeline with reduced storage needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges in retrieving multimodal slide content where traditional modality-separated indexing increases complexity and loses context.

Method: Evaluates ColPali embeddings, BM25 hybrid retrieval, visual/textual rerankers, and introduces VLM-based captioning for efficient storage.

Result: VLM captioning achieved comparable retrieval performance to visual methods while requiring 200x less embedding storage (1GB vs 200GB).

Conclusion: Hybrid BM25+dense retrieval with fusion methods offers best balance between efficiency and effectiveness for real-world slide retrieval systems.

Abstract: Slide decks, serving as digital reports that bridge the gap between
presentation slides and written documents, are a prevalent medium for conveying
information in both academic and corporate settings. Their multimodal nature,
combining text, images, and charts, presents challenges for retrieval-augmented
generation systems, where the quality of retrieval directly impacts downstream
performance. Traditional approaches to slide retrieval often involve separate
indexing of modalities, which can increase complexity and lose contextual
information. This paper investigates various methodologies for effective slide
retrieval, including visual late-interaction embedding models like ColPali, the
use of visual rerankers, and hybrid retrieval techniques that combine dense
retrieval with BM25, further enhanced by textual rerankers and fusion methods
like Reciprocal Rank Fusion. A novel Vision-Language Models-based captioning
pipeline is also evaluated, demonstrating significantly reduced embedding
storage requirements compared to visual late-interaction techniques, alongside
comparable retrieval performance. Our analysis extends to the practical aspects
of these methods, evaluating their runtime performance and storage demands
alongside retrieval efficacy, thus offering practical guidance for the
selection and development of efficient and robust slide retrieval systems for
real-world applications.

Abstract: Traditional efforts to measure historical structural oppression struggle with
cross-national validity due to the unique, locally specified histories of
exclusion, colonization, and social status in each country, and often have
relied on structured indices that privilege material resources while
overlooking lived, identity-based exclusion. We introduce a novel framework for
oppression measurement that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate
context-sensitive scores of lived historical disadvantage across diverse
geopolitical settings. Using unstructured self-identified ethnicity utterances
from a multilingual COVID-19 global study, we design rule-guided prompting
strategies that encourage models to produce interpretable, theoretically
grounded estimations of oppression. We systematically evaluate these strategies
across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results demonstrate that LLMs, when
guided by explicit rules, can capture nuanced forms of identity-based
historical oppression within nations. This approach provides a complementary
measurement tool that highlights dimensions of systemic exclusion, offering a
scalable, cross-cultural lens for understanding how oppression manifests in
data-driven research and public health contexts. To support reproducible
evaluation, we release an open-sourced benchmark dataset for assessing LLMs on
oppression measurement

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出LNE-Blocking框架，通过污染检测和干扰操作恢复大语言模型在潜在泄露数据集上的原始性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型训练数据常无意中整合评估基准，导致数据污染问题，使得模型评估不公平。现有方法难以构建完全无污染的数据集，因此需要新方法恢复模型性能。

Method: 框架包含污染检测方法LNE（评估模型污染程度）和干扰操作Blocking（根据污染程度调整干扰强度，引导模型生成非记忆性回答）

Result: 首个高效恢复模型贪婪解码性能的方案，在多个潜在泄露数据集上表现强劲，不同模型和污染程度下均实现稳定性能恢复

Conclusion: LNE-Blocking通过污染检测与响应干扰的协同机制，有效解决数据污染带来的评估失真问题，为后续研究提供可复现方案

Abstract: The problem of data contamination is now almost inevitable during the
development of large language models (LLMs), with the training data commonly
integrating those evaluation benchmarks even unintentionally. This problem
subsequently makes it hard to benchmark LLMs fairly. Instead of constructing
contamination-free datasets (quite hard), we propose a novel framework,
\textbf{LNE-Blocking}, to restore model performance prior to contamination on
potentially leaked datasets. Our framework consists of two components:
contamination detection and disruption operation. For the prompt, the framework
first uses the contamination detection method, \textbf{LNE}, to assess the
extent of contamination in the model. Based on this, it adjusts the intensity
of the disruption operation, \textbf{Blocking}, to elicit non-memorized
responses from the model. Our framework is the first to efficiently restore the
model's greedy decoding performance. This comes with a strong performance on
multiple datasets with potential leakage risks, and it consistently achieves
stable recovery results across different models and varying levels of data
contamination. We release the code at https://github.com/RuijieH/LNE-Blocking
to facilitate research.

TL;DR: WorldForge框架通过三个无需训练的耦合模块实现视频合成的精确轨迹控制，提升运动一致性与生成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频扩散模型存在可控性差与几何不一致问题，传统微调方法会损害预训练知识且计算成本高昂

Method: Intra-Step递归优化网络预测轨迹，Flow-Gated潜空间分离运动/外观，Dual-Path自适应校正轨迹偏移

Result: 跨多个基准测试验证了方法在真实性、轨迹一致性和视觉保真度的优势

Conclusion: 开创了可控视频合成的即插即用新范式，为空间智能任务的生成先验利用提供新思路

Abstract: Recent video diffusion models demonstrate strong potential in spatial
intelligence tasks due to their rich latent world priors. However, this
potential is hindered by their limited controllability and geometric
inconsistency, creating a gap between their strong priors and their practical
use in 3D/4D tasks. As a result, current approaches often rely on retraining or
fine-tuning, which risks degrading pretrained knowledge and incurs high
computational costs. To address this, we propose WorldForge, a training-free,
inference-time framework composed of three tightly coupled modules. Intra-Step
Recursive Refinement introduces a recursive refinement mechanism during
inference, which repeatedly optimizes network predictions within each denoising
step to enable precise trajectory injection. Flow-Gated Latent Fusion leverages
optical flow similarity to decouple motion from appearance in the latent space
and selectively inject trajectory guidance into motion-related channels.
Dual-Path Self-Corrective Guidance compares guided and unguided denoising paths
to adaptively correct trajectory drift caused by noisy or misaligned structural
signals. Together, these components inject fine-grained, trajectory-aligned
guidance without training, achieving both accurate motion control and
photorealistic content generation. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks validate our method's superiority in realism, trajectory
consistency, and visual fidelity. This work introduces a novel plug-and-play
paradigm for controllable video synthesis, offering a new perspective on
leveraging generative priors for spatial intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频基准测试因使用不同帧采样策略导致评估偏差，需在受控条件下准确评估模型性能

Method: 开发帧级精准基准测试，在受控帧采样策略下评估顶尖小型视频语言模型(SVLMs)的视频问答能力

Result: 证实帧采样偏差存在，揭示SVLMs在不同采样技术下呈现数据集相关性和任务特异性行为

Conclusion: 通过开源基准代码推动可重复评估，强调未来研究需为各数据集制定定制化标准化帧采样策略

Abstract: Comparing vision language models on videos is particularly complex, as the
performances is jointly determined by the model's visual representation
capacity and the frame-sampling strategy used to construct the input. Current
video benchmarks are suspected to suffer from substantial frame-sampling bias,
as models are evaluated with different frame selection strategies. In this
work, we propose the first frame-accurate benchmark of state-of-the-art small
VLMs for video question-answering, evaluated under controlled frame-sampling
strategies. Our results confirm the suspected bias and highlight both
data-specific and task-specific behaviors of SVLMs under different
frame-sampling techniques. By open-sourcing our benchmarking code, we provide
the community with a reproducible and unbiased protocol for evaluating video
VLMs and emphasize the need for standardized frame-sampling strategies tailored
to each benchmarking dataset in future research.

TL;DR: 提出多智能体框架MARIC，通过协作推理实现高效图像分类，超越传统参数密集型模型和单次推理的视觉语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型依赖参数密集训练和标注数据，现有视觉语言模型受限于单次表征，难以捕捉视觉内容的互补特征。

Method: 1.大纲智能体生成全局主题提示 → 2.三个专项智能体提取多维度特征 → 3.推理智能体综合生成分类表示

Result: 在4个图像分类基准测试中显著超越基线模型，验证了多智能体协作推理的有效性。

Conclusion: 多视角分解任务与反思式综合的策略，为图像分类提供了更鲁棒和可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Image classification has traditionally relied on parameter-intensive model
training, requiring large-scale annotated datasets and extensive fine tuning to
achieve competitive performance. While recent vision language models (VLMs)
alleviate some of these constraints, they remain limited by their reliance on
single pass representations, often failing to capture complementary aspects of
visual content. In this paper, we introduce Multi Agent based Reasoning for
Image Classification (MARIC), a multi agent framework that reformulates image
classification as a collaborative reasoning process. MARIC first utilizes an
Outliner Agent to analyze the global theme of the image and generate targeted
prompts. Based on these prompts, three Aspect Agents extract fine grained
descriptions along distinct visual dimensions. Finally, a Reasoning Agent
synthesizes these complementary outputs through integrated reflection step,
producing a unified representation for classification. By explicitly
decomposing the task into multiple perspectives and encouraging reflective
synthesis, MARIC mitigates the shortcomings of both parameter-heavy training
and monolithic VLM reasoning. Experiments on 4 diverse image classification
benchmark datasets demonstrate that MARIC significantly outperforms baselines,
highlighting the effectiveness of multi-agent visual reasoning for robust and
interpretable image classification.

TL;DR: 揭示RAG系统在共享指令提示中存在的隐蔽漏洞，提出通过对抗性指令提示（AIP）实现95.23%攻击成功率的新型攻击方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG攻击依赖操纵用户查询，但实际场景中用户输入常被固定/保护。指令提示作为广泛复用却少被审计的组件，成为更现实的攻击目标

Method: 设计AIP攻击框架：1）多样化查询生成模拟语言变体 2）遗传算法联合优化攻击成功率/功能性/隐蔽性 3）通过改变检索行为操控输出

Result: 实现95.23%攻击成功率（ASR），在保持正常功能有效性的前提下成功突破现有防御机制

Conclusion: 暴露RAG系统长期忽视的指令提示安全漏洞，证明共享组件的隐性信任风险，推动RAG安全范式从单一模型防护转向全流程审计

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
retrieving relevant documents from external sources to improve factual accuracy
and verifiability. However, this reliance introduces new attack surfaces within
the retrieval pipeline, beyond the LLM itself. While prior RAG attacks have
exposed such vulnerabilities, they largely rely on manipulating user queries,
which is often infeasible in practice due to fixed or protected user inputs.
This narrow focus overlooks a more realistic and stealthy vector: instructional
prompts, which are widely reused, publicly shared, and rarely audited. Their
implicit trust makes them a compelling target for adversaries to manipulate RAG
behavior covertly.
  We introduce a novel attack for Adversarial Instructional Prompt (AIP) that
exploits adversarial instructional prompts to manipulate RAG outputs by subtly
altering retrieval behavior. By shifting the attack surface to the
instructional prompts, AIP reveals how trusted yet seemingly benign interface
components can be weaponized to degrade system integrity. The attack is crafted
to achieve three goals: (1) naturalness, to evade user detection; (2) utility,
to encourage use of prompts; and (3) robustness, to remain effective across
diverse query variations. We propose a diverse query generation strategy that
simulates realistic linguistic variation in user queries, enabling the
discovery of prompts that generalize across paraphrases and rephrasings.
Building on this, a genetic algorithm-based joint optimization is developed to
evolve adversarial prompts by balancing attack success, clean-task utility, and
stealthiness. Experimental results show that AIP achieves up to 95.23% ASR
while preserving benign functionality. These findings uncover a critical and
previously overlooked vulnerability in RAG systems, emphasizing the need to
reassess the shared instructional prompts.

### [81] [FedMentor: Domain-Aware Differential Privacy for Heterogeneous Federated LLMs in Mental Health](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14275)
*Nobin Sarwar,Shubhashis Roy Dipta*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 联邦学习框架FedMentor通过领域感知差分隐私和自适应噪声机制，在心理健康领域实现隐私保护的LLMs微调，在保持模型效果（BERTScore F1和ROUGE-L仅降低0.5%）的同时将安全输出率提升3%，通信效率支持单GPU训练1.7B参数模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗健康等敏感领域需要平衡LLM微调的隐私保护与模型效用，传统联邦学习可能过度牺牲性能或隐私保障不足。现有方法难以兼顾领域差异化隐私需求与系统可扩展性。

Method: 1. 结合低秩适配(LoRA)和差分隐私(DP)
2. 客户端按数据敏感度设置DP噪声比例
3. 服务器动态监测模型效用，触发噪声自适应衰减机制
4. 联邦框架支持单GPU训练1.7B参数模型

Result: 1. 安全输出率↑3%，毒性指标↓
2. 模型效果保持（与非隐私基线差距<0.5%）
3. 单轮通信<173MB
4. 支持单GPU训练1.7B参数模型

Conclusion: FedMentor为医疗健康等敏感领域提供了可扩展的隐私保护LLM微调方案，通过细粒度隐私预算分配和动态噪声调节，实现安全性与实用性的最佳平衡。

Abstract: Privacy-preserving adaptation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in sensitive
domains (e.g., mental health) requires balancing strict confidentiality with
model utility and safety. We propose FedMentor, a federated fine-tuning
framework that integrates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and domain-aware
Differential Privacy (DP) to meet per-domain privacy budgets while maintaining
performance. Each client (domain) applies a custom DP noise scale proportional
to its data sensitivity, and the server adaptively reduces noise when utility
falls below a threshold. In experiments on three mental health datasets, we
show that FedMentor improves safety over standard Federated Learning without
privacy, raising safe output rates by up to three points and lowering toxicity,
while maintaining utility (BERTScore F1 and ROUGE-L) within 0.5% of the
non-private baseline and close to the centralized upper bound. The framework
scales to backbones with up to 1.7B parameters on single-GPU clients, requiring
< 173 MB of communication per round. FedMentor demonstrates a practical
approach to privately fine-tune LLMs for safer deployments in healthcare and
other sensitive fields.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 大语言模型在多智能体系统中存在组合隐私泄漏风险，本文提出两种防御策略（ToM和CoDef），其中CoDef在隐私-效用平衡上表现最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示多轮交互中看似无害的响应通过组合推理可能导致的隐私泄露现象，突破传统单轮推断的隐私研究框架。

Method: 1. 建立组合隐私风险量化框架；2. 提出基于心理理论的防御机制（ToM）和基于协同共识的防御机制（CoDef）。

Result: CoDef取得最佳平衡结果（Balanced Outcome 79.8%），ToM敏感查询拦截率97%但影响正常任务，思维链防御效果有限（敏感拦截率39%）。

Conclusion: 组合式隐私泄漏构成新型风险，协同防御机制（CoDef）通过显式推理与状态共享实现最优的隐私-效用平衡，为LLM系统安全设计提供新思路。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become integral to multi-agent systems, new
privacy risks emerge that extend beyond memorization, direct inference, or
single-turn evaluations. In particular, seemingly innocuous responses, when
composed across interactions, can cumulatively enable adversaries to recover
sensitive information, a phenomenon we term compositional privacy leakage. We
present the first systematic study of such compositional privacy leaks and
possible mitigation methods in multi-agent LLM systems. First, we develop a
framework that models how auxiliary knowledge and agent interactions jointly
amplify privacy risks, even when each response is benign in isolation. Next, to
mitigate this, we propose and evaluate two defense strategies: (1)
Theory-of-Mind defense (ToM), where defender agents infer a questioner's intent
by anticipating how their outputs may be exploited by adversaries, and (2)
Collaborative Consensus Defense (CoDef), where responder agents collaborate
with peers who vote based on a shared aggregated state to restrict sensitive
information spread. Crucially, we balance our evaluation across compositions
that expose sensitive information and compositions that yield benign
inferences. Our experiments quantify how these defense strategies differ in
balancing the privacy-utility trade-off. We find that while chain-of-thought
alone offers limited protection to leakage (~39% sensitive blocking rate), our
ToM defense substantially improves sensitive query blocking (up to 97%) but can
reduce benign task success. CoDef achieves the best balance, yielding the
highest Balanced Outcome (79.8%), highlighting the benefit of combining
explicit reasoning with defender collaboration. Together, our results expose a
new class of risks in collaborative LLM deployments and provide actionable
insights for designing safeguards against compositional, context-driven privacy
leakage.

Motivation: 现有LLM安全对齐机制存在漏洞，需开发更高效的越狱方法测试模型安全性。

Method: HILL方法系统地将指令式有害请求转换为带有假设性指示的学习式提问，使用简洁提示模板。

Result: 在AdvBench数据集上实现最高攻击成功率，防御方法普遍效果有限甚至适得其反，暴露LLM安全机制缺陷。

Conclusion: 学习式诱导显著削弱安全机制，揭示LLM在帮助性和安全性平衡方面的根本性挑战。

Abstract: Safety alignment aims to prevent Large Language Models (LLMs) from responding
to harmful queries. To strengthen safety protections, jailbreak methods are
developed to simulate malicious attacks and uncover vulnerabilities. In this
paper, we introduce HILL (Hiding Intention by Learning from LLMs), a novel
jailbreak approach that systematically transforms imperative harmful requests
into learning-style questions with only straightforward hypotheticality
indicators. Further, we introduce two new metrics to thoroughly evaluate the
utility of jailbreak methods. Experiments on the AdvBench dataset across a wide
range of models demonstrate HILL's strong effectiveness, generalizability, and
harmfulness. It achieves top attack success rates on the majority of models and
across malicious categories while maintaining high efficiency with concise
prompts. Results of various defense methods show the robustness of HILL, with
most defenses having mediocre effects or even increasing the attack success
rates. Moreover, the assessment on our constructed safe prompts reveals
inherent limitations of LLMs' safety mechanisms and flaws in defense methods.
This work exposes significant vulnerabilities of safety measures against
learning-style elicitation, highlighting a critical challenge of balancing
helpfulness and safety alignments.

Motivation: 现有越狱检测方法依赖额外模型或多轮推理导致计算成本高，需要更高效的检测方案

Method: 1. 预置肯定指令 2. 温度缩放调整logits 3. 结合虚拟指令学习提升检测性能

Result: 在主流对齐LLM上有效检测越狱攻击，推理阶段几乎不增加计算开销

Conclusion: FJD通过置信度分析实现高效越狱检测，为LLM安全提供新思路

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enhance security through alignment when widely
used, but remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks capable of producing
inappropriate content. Jailbreak detection methods show promise in mitigating
jailbreak attacks through the assistance of other models or multiple model
inferences. However, existing methods entail significant computational costs.
In this paper, we first present a finding that the difference in output
distributions between jailbreak and benign prompts can be employed for
detecting jailbreak prompts. Based on this finding, we propose a Free Jailbreak
Detection (FJD) which prepends an affirmative instruction to the input and
scales the logits by temperature to further distinguish between jailbreak and
benign prompts through the confidence of the first token. Furthermore, we
enhance the detection performance of FJD through the integration of virtual
instruction learning. Extensive experiments on aligned LLMs show that our FJD
can effectively detect jailbreak prompts with almost no additional
computational costs during LLM inference.

Abstract: Paralinguistic sounds, like laughter and sighs, are crucial for synthesizing
more realistic and engaging speech. However, existing methods typically depend
on proprietary datasets, while publicly available resources often suffer from
incomplete speech, inaccurate or missing timestamps, and limited real-world
relevance. To address these problems, we propose an automated framework for
generating large-scale paralinguistic data and apply it to construct the
SynParaSpeech dataset. The dataset comprises 6 paralinguistic categories with
118.75 hours of data and precise timestamps, all derived from natural
conversational speech. Our contributions lie in introducing the first automated
method for constructing large-scale paralinguistic datasets and releasing the
SynParaSpeech corpus, which advances speech generation through more natural
paralinguistic synthesis and enhances speech understanding by improving
paralinguistic event detection. The dataset and audio samples are available at

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become key components of modern software,
with prompts acting as their de-facto programming interface. However, prompt
design remains largely empirical and small mistakes can cascade into
unreliable, insecure, or inefficient behavior. This paper presents the first
systematic survey and taxonomy of prompt defects, recurring ways that prompts
fail to elicit their intended behavior from LLMs. We organize defects along six
dimensions: (1) Specification and Intent, (2) Input and Content, (3) Structure
and Formatting, (4) Context and Memory, (5) Performance and Efficiency, and (6)
Maintainability and Engineering. Each dimension is refined into fine-grained
subtypes, illustrated with concrete examples and root cause analysis. Grounded
in software engineering principles, we show how these defects surface in real
development workflows and examine their downstream effects. For every subtype,
we distill mitigation strategies that span emerging prompt engineering
patterns, automated guardrails, testing harnesses, and evaluation frameworks.
We then summarize these strategies in a master taxonomy that links defect,
impact, and remedy. We conclude with open research challenges and a call for
rigorous engineering-oriented methodologies to ensure that LLM-driven systems
are dependable by design.

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled

Conclusion: 多模态信息的协同利用显著提升对话代理的拟真度，开源代码促进相关领域发展。

Abstract: Human conversation involves language, speech, and visual cues, with each
medium providing complementary information. For instance, speech conveys a vibe
or tone not fully captured by text alone. While multimodal LLMs focus on
generating text responses from diverse inputs, less attention has been paid to
generating natural and engaging speech. We propose a human-like agent that
generates speech responses based on conversation mood and responsive style
information. To achieve this, we build a novel MultiSensory Conversation
dataset focused on speech to enable agents to generate natural speech. We then
propose a multimodal LLM-based model for generating text responses and voice
descriptions, which are used to generate speech covering paralinguistic
information. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of utilizing
both visual and audio modalities in conversation to generate engaging speech.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate or augment
penetration testing, but their effectiveness and reliability across attack
phases remain unclear. We present a comprehensive evaluation of multiple
LLM-based agents, from single-agent to modular designs, across realistic
penetration testing scenarios, measuring empirical performance and recurring
failure patterns. We also isolate the impact of five core functional
capabilities via targeted augmentations: Global Context Memory (GCM),
Inter-Agent Messaging (IAM), Context-Conditioned Invocation (CCI), Adaptive
Planning (AP), and Real-Time Monitoring (RTM). These interventions support,
respectively: (i) context coherence and retention, (ii) inter-component
coordination and state management, (iii) tool use accuracy and selective
execution, (iv) multi-step strategic planning, error detection, and recovery,

TL;DR: DeKeyNLU数据集通过精细标注的1500个QA对优化RAG流程中的任务分解与关键词提取，基于该数据集训练的DeKeySQL模型在BIRD和Spider数据集上分别提升SQL生成准确率6.79%和4.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NL2SQL方法存在任务分解不精准、关键词提取错误导致SQL生成失误的问题，且现有数据集存在任务碎片化和领域标注缺失的局限性。

Method: 构建DeKeyNLU标注数据集，开发DeKeySQL三阶段RAG流程（问题理解-实体检索-生成优化），通过领域微调提升模型表现。

Result: 在BIRD开发集准确率从62.31%提升至69.10%，Spider开发集从84.2%提升至88.7%，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 系统化的任务分解标注与领域适配微调显著提升NL2SQL性能，为复杂数据库查询场景提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) provides a new model-centric paradigm that
simplifies database access for non-technical users by converting natural
language queries into SQL commands. Recent advancements, particularly those
integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning, have made significant strides in enhancing NL2SQL performance.
However, challenges such as inaccurate task decomposition and keyword
extraction by LLMs remain major bottlenecks, often leading to errors in SQL
generation. While existing datasets aim to mitigate these issues by fine-tuning
models, they struggle with over-fragmentation of tasks and lack of
domain-specific keyword annotations, limiting their effectiveness. To address
these limitations, we present DeKeyNLU, a novel dataset which contains 1,500
meticulously annotated QA pairs aimed at refining task decomposition and
enhancing keyword extraction precision for the RAG pipeline. Fine-tuned with
DeKeyNLU, we propose DeKeySQL, a RAG-based NL2SQL pipeline that employs three
distinct modules for user question understanding, entity retrieval, and
generation to improve SQL generation accuracy. We benchmarked multiple model
configurations within DeKeySQL RAG pipeline. Experimental results demonstrate
that fine-tuning with DeKeyNLU significantly improves SQL generation accuracy
on both BIRD (62.31% to 69.10%) and Spider (84.2% to 88.7%) dev datasets.

Conclusion: 该理论框架为机器推理的可解释性研究提供新范式，为构建可控、透明的推理系统奠定理论基础，推动认知科学与AI的深度融合。

Abstract: While Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) generate extensive chain-of-thought
reasoning, we lack a principled framework for understanding how these thoughts
are structured. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach by applying
Schoenfeld's Episode Theory, a classic cognitive framework for human
mathematical problem-solving, to analyze the reasoning traces of LRMs. We
annotated thousands of sentences and paragraphs from model-generated solutions
to math problems using seven cognitive labels (e.g., Plan, Implement, Verify).
The result is the first publicly available benchmark for the fine-grained
analysis of machine reasoning, including a large annotated corpus and detailed
annotation guidebooks. Our preliminary analysis reveals distinct patterns in
LRM reasoning, such as the transition dynamics between cognitive states. This
framework provides a theoretically grounded methodology for interpreting LRM
cognition and enables future work on more controllable and transparent
reasoning systems.

Abstract: Spatial audio reasoning enables machines to interpret auditory scenes by
understanding events and their spatial attributes. In this work, we focus on
spatial audio understanding with an emphasis on reasoning about moving sources.
First, we introduce a spatial audio encoder that processes spatial audio to
detect multiple overlapping events and estimate their spatial attributes,
Direction of Arrival (DoA) and source distance, at the frame level. To
generalize to unseen events, we incorporate an audio grounding model that
aligns audio features with semantic audio class text embeddings via a
cross-attention mechanism. Second, to answer complex queries about dynamic
audio scenes involving moving sources, we condition a large language model
(LLM) on structured spatial attributes extracted by our model. Finally, we
introduce a spatial audio motion understanding and reasoning benchmark dataset
and demonstrate our framework's performance against the baseline model.

Method: 证明三种能量公式的数学等价性，提出基于Beta分布的2D参数化方案简化计划搜索空间

Result: 在合成和真实数据实验中，能量启发式采样计划在低步数场景超越人工基准模型

Conclusion: 该工作实现了MDMs理论统一与实用优化的双重突破，为高效采样提供了新范式

Abstract: We present a systematic theoretical framework that interprets masked
diffusion models (MDMs) as solutions to energy minimization problems in
discrete optimal transport. Specifically, we prove that three distinct energy
formulations--kinetic, conditional kinetic, and geodesic energy--are
mathematically equivalent under the structure of MDMs, and that MDMs minimize
all three when the mask schedule satisfies a closed-form optimality condition.
This unification not only clarifies the theoretical foundations of MDMs, but
also motivates practical improvements in sampling. By parameterizing
interpolation schedules via Beta distributions, we reduce the schedule design
space to a tractable 2D search, enabling efficient post-training tuning without
model modification. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks
demonstrate that our energy-inspired schedules outperform hand-crafted
baselines, particularly in low-step sampling settings.

Method: DSCL框架包含：1）基于多维奖励统计的样本筛选（均值方差过滤） 2）自适应的子任务课程学习机制

Result: 在BFCLv3基准实现3.29%的性能提升，显著优于现有基线方法

Conclusion: 通过有效整合复杂奖励信号和子任务动态，DSCL为工具学习提供了定制化的高效训练解决方案

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly used for LLM-based tool
learning, its efficiency is often hampered by an overabundance of simple
samples that provide diminishing learning value as training progresses.
Existing dynamic sampling techniques are ill-suited for the multi-task
structure and fine-grained reward mechanisms inherent to tool learning. This
paper introduces Dynamic Sampling with Curriculum Learning (DSCL), a framework
specifically designed to address this challenge by targeting the unique
characteristics of tool learning: its multiple interdependent sub-tasks and
multi-valued reward functions. DSCL features two core components: Reward-Based
Dynamic Sampling, which uses multi-dimensional reward statistics (mean and
variance) to prioritize valuable data, and Task-Based Dynamic Curriculum
Learning, which adaptively focuses training on less-mastered sub-tasks. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DSCL significantly improves training
efficiency and model performance over strong baselines, achieving a 3.29\%
improvement on the BFCLv3 benchmark. Our method provides a tailored solution
that effectively leverages the complex reward signals and sub-task dynamics
within tool learning to achieve superior results.

Method: 采用时间差异（TD）正则化训练奖励模型，最小化时间差异以获得更平滑的奖励信号

Result: 实验显示在Best-of-N提升6.6%、树搜索提升23.7%，与RLVR结合时仅需2.5k数据即可达到基线50.1k数据效果

Conclusion: TDRM作为补充方法显著提升多模型性能，代码开源促进后续研究

Abstract: Reward models are central to both reinforcement learning (RL) with language
models and inference-time verification. However, existing reward models often
lack temporal consistency, leading to ineffective policy updates and unstable
RL training. We introduce TDRM, a method for learning smoother and more
reliable reward models by minimizing temporal differences during training. This
temporal-difference (TD) regularization produces smooth rewards and improves
alignment with long-term objectives. Incorporating TDRM into the actor-critic
style online RL loop yields consistent empirical gains. It is worth noting that
TDRM is a supplement to verifiable reward methods, and both can be used in
series. Experiments show that TD-trained process reward models (PRMs) improve
performance across Best-of-N (up to 6.6%) and tree-search (up to 23.7%)
settings. When combined with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR), TD-trained PRMs lead to more data-efficient RL -- achieving comparable
performance with just 2.5k data to what baseline methods require 50.1k data to
attain -- and yield higher-quality language model policies on 8 model variants
(5 series), e.g., Qwen2.5-(0.5B, 1,5B), GLM4-9B-0414, GLM-Z1-9B-0414,

Result: 在5个数学推理基准测试中实现稳定提升，准确率平均提升3.5%以上，显著优于现有最佳方法DFT

Conclusion: 主动策略对齐机制有效降低离策略方差，为大规模语言模型微调提供了更稳定的优化路径

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models can be viewed as an
off-policy learning problem, where expert demonstrations come from a fixed
behavior policy while training aims to optimize a target policy. Importance
sampling is the standard tool for correcting this distribution mismatch, but
large policy gaps lead to high variance and training instability. Existing
approaches mitigate this issue using KL penalties or clipping, which passively
constrain updates rather than actively reducing the gap. We propose a simple
yet effective data rewriting framework that proactively shrinks the policy gap
by keeping correct solutions as on-policy data and rewriting incorrect ones
with guided re-solving, falling back to expert demonstrations only when needed.
This aligns the training distribution with the target policy before
optimization, reducing importance sampling variance and stabilizing off-policy
fine-tuning. Experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate
consistent and significant gains over both vanilla SFT and the state-of-the-art
Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT) approach. The data and code will be released at
https://github.com/NKU-HLT/Off-Policy-SFT.

Method: 1. 多数投票答案作为稳定锚点 2. 语义空间计算响应差异度作为新颖性奖励 3. GRPO框架+非对称剪裁保持强信号 4. 熵正则化维持搜索空间

Result: Qwen3-4B在AIME25任务上：pass@1从4.6%→16.4%，pass@16从18.5%→37.9%；跨领域（GPQA）泛化能力提升

Conclusion: EVOL-RL有效防止多样性衰减，支持长思维链生成，兼容RLVR场景，为无监督强化学习提供新范式

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained with reinforcement
learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR), yet real-world deployment demands
models that can self-improve without labels or external judges. Existing
label-free methods, confidence minimization, self-consistency, or majority-vote
objectives, stabilize learning but steadily shrink exploration, causing an
entropy collapse: generations become shorter, less diverse, and brittle. Unlike
prior approaches such as Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL), which
primarily adapt models to the immediate unlabeled dataset at hand, our goal is
broader: to enable general improvements without sacrificing the model's
inherent exploration capacity and generalization ability, i.e., evolving. We
formalize this issue and propose EVolution-Oriented and Label-free
Reinforcement Learning (EVOL-RL), a simple rule that couples stability with
variation under a label-free setting. EVOL-RL keeps the majority-voted answer
as a stable anchor (selection) while adding a novelty-aware reward that favors
responses whose reasoning differs from what has already been produced
(variation), measured in semantic space. Implemented with GRPO, EVOL-RL also
uses asymmetric clipping to preserve strong signals and an entropy regularizer
to sustain search. This majority-for-selection + novelty-for-variation design
prevents collapse, maintains longer and more informative chains of thought, and
improves both pass@1 and pass@n. EVOL-RL consistently outperforms the
majority-only TTRL baseline; e.g., training on label-free AIME24 lifts
Qwen3-4B-Base AIME25 pass@1 from TTRL's 4.6% to 16.4%, and pass@16 from 18.5%
to 37.9%. EVOL-RL not only prevents diversity collapse but also unlocks
stronger generalization across domains (e.g., GPQA). Furthermore, we
demonstrate that EVOL-RL also boosts performance in the RLVR setting,
highlighting its broad applicability.

Motivation: 现有奖励最大化方法（如PPO/GRPO）过度优化主导奖励信号，忽视有效但低频的推理路径，导致多样性降低

Method: 将标量奖励转换为归一化目标分布，通过最小化反向KL散度实现流平衡优化，促进多样化探索

Result: 数学任务平均提升10.0%（GRPO）和5.1%（PPO），代码推理任务表现持续更优

Conclusion: 奖励分布匹配是实现高效探索和多样化推理的关键路径，推动LLM强化学习发展

Abstract: We propose FlowRL: matching the full reward distribution via flow balancing
instead of maximizing rewards in large language model (LLM) reinforcement
learning (RL). Recent advanced reasoning models adopt reward-maximizing methods
(\eg, PPO and GRPO), which tend to over-optimize dominant reward signals while
neglecting less frequent but valid reasoning paths, thus reducing diversity. In
contrast, we transform scalar rewards into a normalized target distribution
using a learnable partition function, and then minimize the reverse KL
divergence between the policy and the target distribution. We implement this
idea as a flow-balanced optimization method that promotes diverse exploration
and generalizable reasoning trajectories. We conduct experiments on math and
code reasoning tasks: FlowRL achieves a significant average improvement of
$10.0\%$ over GRPO and $5.1\%$ over PPO on math benchmarks, and performs
consistently better on code reasoning tasks. These results highlight reward
distribution-matching as a key step toward efficient exploration and diverse
reasoning in LLM reinforcement learning.
