The key insight of Morse is to\nreformulate the iterative generation (from noise to data) process via taking\nadvantage of fast jump sampling and adaptive residual feedback strategies.\nSpecifically, Morse involves two models called Dash and Dot that interact with\neach other. The Dash model is just the pre-trained diffusion model of any type,\nbut operates in a jump sampling regime, creating sufficient space for sampling\nefficiency improvement. The Dot model is significantly faster than the Dash\nmodel, which is learnt to generate residual feedback conditioned on the\nobservations at the current jump sampling point on the trajectory of the Dash\nmodel, lifting the noise estimate to easily match the next-step estimate of the\nDash model without jump sampling. By chaining the outputs of the Dash and Dot\nmodels run in a time-interleaved fashion, Morse exhibits the merit of flexibly\nattaining desired image generation performance while improving overall runtime\nefficiency. With our proposed weight sharing strategy between the Dash and Dot\nmodels, Morse is efficient for training and inference. Our method shows a\nlossless speedup of 1.78X to 3.31X on average over a wide range of sampling\nstep budgets relative to 9 baseline diffusion models on 6 image generation\ntasks.

We uncover several key concerns that strongly question the prospect of\nusing current LLMs as decision-making assistants: (1) a large variance in\nresponses between LLMs, (2) within a single LLM, responses show fragility to\nminor variations in prompt phrasing (e.g., reformulating the question in the\nfirst person can considerably alter the decision), (3) LLMs can accept\nunreasonably low rewards for major inconveniences (e.g., 1 Euro to wait 10\nhours), and (4) LLMs can reject monetary gains where no discomfort is imposed\n(e.g., 1,000 Euro to wait 0 minutes). These findings emphasize the need for\nscrutiny of how LLMs value human inconvenience, particularly as we move toward\napplications where such cash-versus-comfort trade-offs are made on users'\nbehalf."}

During SME, the general capabilities of LLMs can be\nnegatively affected due to the introduction of new parameters. In this paper,\nwe propose a queue-based self-correction framework (QueueEDIT) that not only\nenhances SME performance by addressing long-sequence dependency but also\nmitigates the impact of parameter bias on the general capabilities of LLMs.\nSpecifically, we first introduce a structural mapping editing loss to map the\ntriplets to the knowledge-sensitive neurons within the Transformer layers of\nLLMs. We then store the located parameters for each piece of edited knowledge\nin a queue and dynamically align previously edited parameters. In each edit, we\nselect queue parameters most relevant to the currently located parameters to\ndetermine whether previous knowledge needs realignment.

To quantify this\nconcentration, we introduce the Branching Factor (BF) -- a token-invariant\nmeasure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our\nempirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as\ngeneration progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they\ngenerate. (2) alignment tuning substantially sharpens the model's output\ndistribution from the outset, reducing BF by nearly an order of magnitude\n(e.g., from 12 to 1.2) relative to base models. This stark reduction helps\nexplain why aligned models often appear less sensitive to decoding strategies.\nBuilding on this insight, we find this stability has surprising implications\nfor complex reasoning. Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g.,\nDeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating\nlonger reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic\n(lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs. We hypothesize that\nalignment tuning does not fundamentally change a model's behavior, but instead\nsteers it toward stylistic tokens (e.g., \"Sure\") that unlock low-entropy\ntrajectories already present in the base model. This view is supported by\nnudging experiments, which show that prompting base models with such tokens can\nsimilarly reduce BF. Together, our findings establish BF as a powerful\ndiagnostic for understanding and controlling LLM outputs - clarifying how\nalignment reduces variability, how CoT promotes stable generations, and how\nbase models can be steered away from diversity."}

In extensive evaluations on SOTA\nreasoning models across a broad range of benchmarks, we find that reasoning\nmodels: (i) are typically overconfident, with self-verbalized confidence\nestimates often greater than 85% particularly for incorrect responses, (ii)\nbecome even more overconfident with deeper reasoning, and (iii) can become\nbetter calibrated through introspection (e.g., o3-Mini and DeepSeek R1) but not\nuniformly (e.g., Claude 3.7 Sonnet becomes more poorly calibrated). Lastly, we\nconclude with important research directions to design necessary UQ benchmarks\nand improve the calibration of reasoning models."}

To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of\nprograms representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source\ncode and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We\nfind evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for\ninputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations.\nFirstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code\nrather than semantically equivalent language descriptions. Secondly, LLMs can\nproduce outputs for w/o IO programs directly, by implicitly evaluating the\nprogram within the forward pass, and more reliably when stepping through the\nprogram in-context via chain-of-thought. We further show that PBB leads to more\nrobust evaluation of programs across inputs than training on I/O pairs drawn\nfrom a distribution that mirrors naturally occurring data.

USAD offers competitive performance\nacross various benchmarks and datasets, including frame and instance-level\nspeech processing tasks, audio tagging, and sound classification, achieving\nnear state-of-the-art results with a single encoder on SUPERB and HEAR\nbenchmarks."}

Unlike\nOmniGen v1, OmniGen2 features two distinct decoding pathways for text and image\nmodalities, utilizing unshared parameters and a decoupled image tokenizer. This\ndesign enables OmniGen2 to build upon existing multimodal understanding models\nwithout the need to re-adapt VAE inputs, thereby preserving the original text\ngeneration capabilities. To facilitate the training of OmniGen2, we developed\ncomprehensive data construction pipelines, encompassing image editing and\nin-context generation data. Additionally, we introduce a reflection mechanism\ntailored for image generation tasks and curate a dedicated reflection dataset\nbased on OmniGen2. Despite its relatively modest parameter size, OmniGen2\nachieves competitive results on multiple task benchmarks, including\ntext-to-image and image editing. To further evaluate in-context generation,\nalso referred to as subject-driven tasks, we introduce a new benchmark named\nOmniContext. OmniGen2 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source\nmodels in terms of consistency. We will release our models, training code,\ndatasets, and data construction pipeline to support future research in this\nfield.

By integrating vision and text into a unified space\nwith an expanded vocabulary, our multimodal LLM, Tar, enables cross-modal input\nand output through a shared interface, without the need for modality-specific\ndesigns. Additionally, we propose scale-adaptive encoding and decoding to\nbalance efficiency and visual detail, along with a generative de-tokenizer to\nproduce high-fidelity visual outputs. To address diverse decoding needs, we\nutilize two complementary de-tokenizers: a fast autoregressive model and a\ndiffusion-based model. To enhance modality fusion, we investigate advanced\npre-training tasks, demonstrating improvements in both visual understanding and\ngeneration. Experiments across benchmarks show that Tar matches or surpasses\nexisting multimodal LLM methods, achieving faster convergence and greater\ntraining efficiency.
