Specifically, the model employs\ntwo separate neural networks to model elastic and plastic constitutive laws.\nSimultaneously, the model incorporates physical parameters as conditional\ninputs and is trained on comprehensive datasets encompassing multiple scenarios\nwith varying physical parameters, thereby enabling generalization across\ndifferent properties without requiring retraining for each individual case.\nFurthermore, the differentiable architecture of our model, combined with its\nexplicit parameter inputs, enables the inverse estimation of physical\nparameters from observed motion sequences. This capability extends our\nframework to objects with unknown or unmeasured properties.

Recent research\nshows that combining LLMs and TAGs yields complementary benefits: enhancing TAG\nrepresentation learning and improving the reasoning and interpretability of\nLLMs. This survey provides the first systematic review of LLM--TAG integration\nfrom an orchestration perspective. We introduce a novel taxonomy covering two\nfundamental directions: LLM for TAG, where LLMs enrich graph-based tasks, and\nTAG for LLM, where structured graphs improve LLM reasoning. We categorize\norchestration strategies into sequential, parallel, and multi-module\nframeworks, and discuss advances in TAG-specific pretraining, prompting, and\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning. Beyond methodology, we summarize empirical\ninsights, curate available datasets, and highlight diverse applications across\nrecommendation systems, biomedical analysis, and knowledge-intensive question\nanswering. Finally, we outline open challenges and promising research\ndirections, aiming to guide future work at the intersection of language and\ngraph learning."}

Recent advances in large language\nmodels (LLMs) have shown promise in emulating human behaviors, interactions,\nand decision-making, offering a powerful new lens for social science studies.\nHowever, the extent to which LLMs diverge from authentic human behavior in\nsocial contexts remains underexplored, posing risks of misinterpretation in\nscientific studies and unintended consequences in real-world applications.\nHere, we introduce a systematic framework for analyzing LLMs' behavior in\nsocial simulation. Our approach simulates multi-agent interactions through\nchatroom-style conversations and analyzes them across five linguistic\ndimensions, providing a simple yet effective method to examine emergent social\ncognitive biases. We conduct extensive experiments involving eight\nrepresentative LLMs across three families. Our findings reveal that LLMs do not\nfaithfully reproduce genuine human behavior but instead reflect overly\nidealized versions of it, shaped by the social desirability bias. In\nparticular, LLMs show social role bias, primacy effect, and positivity bias,\nresulting in \"Utopian\" societies that lack the complexity and variability of\nreal human interactions. These findings call for more socially grounded LLMs\nthat capture the diversity of human social behavior."}

Large Language\nModels (LLMs) and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) offer opportunities to augment\ndispatchers. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a taxonomy-grounded,\nLLM-powered multi-agent system for simulating realistic EMD scenarios. Methods:\nWe constructed a clinical taxonomy (32 chief complaints, 6 caller identities\nfrom MIMIC-III) and a six-phase call protocol. Using this framework, we\ndeveloped an AutoGen-based MAS with Caller and Dispatcher Agents. The system\ngrounds interactions in a fact commons to ensure clinical plausibility and\nmitigate misinformation. We used a hybrid evaluation framework: four physicians\nassessed 100 simulated cases for \"Guidance Efficacy\" and \"Dispatch\nEffectiveness,\" supplemented by automated linguistic analysis (sentiment,\nreadability, politeness). Results: Human evaluation, with substantial\ninter-rater agreement (Gwe's AC1 > 0.70), confirmed the system's high\nperformance. It demonstrated excellent Dispatch Effectiveness (e.g., 94 %\ncontacting the correct potential other agents) and Guidance Efficacy (advice\nprovided in 91 % of cases), both rated highly by physicians. Algorithmic\nmetrics corroborated these findings, indicating a predominantly neutral\naffective profile (73.7 % neutral sentiment; 90.4 % neutral emotion), high\nreadability (Flesch 80.9), and a consistently polite style (60.0 % polite; 0 %\nimpolite). Conclusion: Our taxonomy-grounded MAS simulates diverse, clinically\nplausible dispatch scenarios with high fidelity.

Our work, focusing exclusively on the English language, seeks to\nshed light on the underlying aspects responsible for this robustness. We\nhypothesize that the main reasons have to do with the fact that (i) relatively\nfew English words collapse under typoglycemia, and that (ii) collapsed words\ntend to occur in contexts so distinct that disambiguation becomes trivial. In\nour analysis, we (i) analyze the British National Corpus to quantify word\ncollapse and ambiguity under typoglycemia, (ii) evaluate BERT's ability to\ndisambiguate collapsing forms, and (iii) conduct a probing experiment by\ncomparing variants of BERT trained from scratch on clean versus typoglycemic\nWikipedia text; our results reveal that the performance degradation caused by\nscrambling is smaller than expected."}

For instance, an RLM reasons that harmful\nrequests like ``outline a strategy for stealing customers' credit card\ninformation from a retail store'' could be associated with the benign intent of\n``a security professional trying to test defense,'' despite no such benign\ncontext being provided as input.

We also derive geometric insights on how CFEs\neffectively act as knowledge probes, helping the students mimic the teacher's\ndecision boundaries more effectively than standard data.
