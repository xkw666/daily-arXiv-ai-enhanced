We attribute\nthis limitation to their failure in holistically utilizing available\ninformation (query, context list, and generator) for comprehensive quality\nassessment. Inspired by recent advances in data selection, we reconceptualize\ncontext quality assessment as an inference-time data valuation problem and\nintroduce the Contextual Influence Value (CI value). This novel metric\nquantifies context quality by measuring the performance degradation when\nremoving each context from the list, effectively integrating query-aware\nrelevance, list-aware uniqueness, and generator-aware alignment. Moreover, CI\nvalue eliminates complex selection hyperparameter tuning by simply retaining\ncontexts with positive CI values. To address practical challenges of label\ndependency and computational overhead, we develop a parameterized surrogate\nmodel for CI value prediction during inference. The model employs a\nhierarchical architecture that captures both local query-context relevance and\nglobal inter-context interactions, trained through oracle CI value supervision\nand end-to-end generator feedback.

While KV-cache compression via low-rank projection is a promising\ndirection, existing methods rely on a static, offline-learned subspace that\nperforms poorly under data distribution shifts. To overcome these limitations,\nwe introduce OjaKV, a novel framework that integrates a strategic hybrid\nstorage policy with online subspace adaptation. First, OjaKV recognizes that\nnot all tokens are equally important for compression; it preserves the crucial\nfirst and most recent tokens in full-rank, maintaining high-fidelity anchors\nfor attention. Second, for the vast majority of intermediate tokens, it applies\nlow-rank compression by incrementally adapting the projection basis using Oja's\nalgorithm for online principal component analysis. This adaptation involves a\ncomprehensive update during prompt prefilling and lightweight periodic updates\nduring decoding, ensuring the subspace remains aligned with the evolving\ncontext. Crucially, our framework is fully compatible with modern attention\nmodules like FlashAttention.

This paper\npresents Think-on-Graph 3.0 (ToG-3), a novel framework that introduces\nMulti-Agent Context Evolution and Retrieval (MACER) mechanism to overcome these\nlimitations. Our core innovation is the dynamic construction and refinement of\na Chunk-Triplets-Community heterogeneous graph index, which pioneeringly\nincorporates a dual-evolution mechanism of Evolving Query and Evolving\nSub-Graph for precise evidence retrieval.

While intuitive, this depth-first\npipeline coupled with sample-wise updating over-optimizes each edit and induces\ninterference across edits. Our controlled experiments reveal that simply\nrestoring fine-tuning to the standard breadth-first (i.e., epoch-based)\npipeline with mini-batch optimization substantially improves its effectiveness\nfor model editing.

In this work, we propose CoSpaDi (Compression\nvia Sparse Dictionary Learning), a novel training-free compression framework\nthat replaces low-rank decomposition with a more flexible structured sparse\nfactorization in which each weight matrix is represented with a dense\ndictionary and a column-sparse coefficient matrix. This formulation enables a\nunion-of-subspaces representation: different columns of the original weight\nmatrix are approximated in distinct subspaces spanned by adaptively selected\ndictionary atoms, offering greater expressiveness than a single invariant\nbasis.

Hence, it is essential to investigate the capability of\ntransformers in the task of inferring transitive relations (e.g., knowing A\ncauses B and B causes C, then A causes C). The task of inferring transitive\nrelations is equivalent to the task of connectivity in directed graphs (e.g.,\nknowing there is a path from A to B, and there is a path from B to C, then\nthere is a path from A to C). Past research focused on whether transformers can\nlearn to infer transitivity from in-context examples provided in the input\nprompt.

In this\nstudy, we seek to answer this question by generating directed graphs to train\ntransformer models of varying sizes and evaluate their ability to infer\ntransitive relations for various graph sizes. Our findings suggest that\ntransformers are capable of learning connectivity on \"grid-like'' directed\ngraphs where each node can be embedded in a low-dimensional subspace, and\nconnectivity is easily inferable from the embeddings of the nodes. We find that\nthe dimensionality of the underlying grid graph is a strong predictor of\ntransformers' ability to learn the connectivity task, where higher-dimensional\ngrid graphs pose a greater challenge than low-dimensional grid graphs. In\naddition, we observe that increasing the model scale leads to increasingly\nbetter generalization to infer connectivity over grid graphs.

Using a well-established color naming\ntask, we simulate the evolution of a lexical system within a single generation,\nand study which factors lead agents to: (i) develop human-like naming behavior\nand lexicons, and (ii) change their behavior and lexicons according to their\ncommunicative needs.

Traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are\ntext-only and often rely on a single storage backend, most commonly a vector\ndatabase. In practice, this monolithic design suffers from unavoidable\ntrade-offs: vector search captures semantic similarity yet loses global\ncontext; knowledge graphs excel at relational precision but struggle with\nrecall; full-text indexes are fast and exact yet semantically blind; and\nrelational engines such as MySQL provide strong transactional guarantees but no\nsemantic understanding.

Furthermore, we propose three novel strategies to\nevaluate the monitor: content filtering (removing deception-related text from\ninputs), score filtering (aggregating only over task-relevant tokens), and\nprompt distilled fine-tuned model organisms (models trained to exhibit\ndeceptive behavior without explicit prompting). Using deception detection as a\nrepresentative case study, we identify two forms of leakage that inflate\nmonitor performance: elicitation leakage from prompts that explicitly request\nharmful behavior, and reasoning leakage from models that verbalize their\ndeceptive actions. Through experiments on multiple deception benchmarks, we\napply our proposed mitigation strategies and measure performance retention.

Traditional query rewriting relies on human annotators to clarify\nqueries, but due to limitations in annotators' expressive ability and depth of\nunderstanding, manually rewritten queries often diverge from those needed in\nreal-world RAG systems, resulting in a gap between user intent and system\nresponse. We observe that high-quality synthetic queries can better bridge this\ngap, achieving superior performance in both retrieval and generation compared\nto human rewrites. This raises an interesting question: Can rewriting models\ntrained on synthetic queries better capture user intent than human annotators?\nIn this paper, we propose SynRewrite, a synthetic data-driven query rewriting\nmodel to generate high-quality synthetic rewrites more aligned with user\nintent. To construct training data, we prompt GPT-4o with dialogue history,\ncurrent queries, positive documents, and answers to synthesize high-quality\nrewrites. A Flan-T5 model is then finetuned on this dataset to map dialogue\nhistory and queries to synthetic rewrites. Finally, we further enhance the\nrewriter using the generator's feedback through the DPO algorithm to boost\nend-task performance. Experiments on TopiOCQA and QRECC datasets show that\nSynRewrite consistently outperforms human rewrites in both retrieval and\ngeneration tasks.

In contrast to existing VLM-based approaches that\ntreat action prediction as a text generation task, our key insight is to\nconsider action prediction for AVLN as a 2D spatial grounding task. SPF\nharnesses VLMs to decompose vague language instructions into iterative\nannotation of 2D waypoints on the input image. Along with the predicted\ntraveling distance, SPF transforms predicted 2D waypoints into 3D displacement\nvectors as action commands for UAVs. Moreover, SPF also adaptively adjusts the\ntraveling distance to facilitate more efficient navigation. Notably, SPF\nperforms navigation in a closed-loop control manner, enabling UAVs to follow\ndynamic targets in dynamic environments. SPF sets a new state of the art in DRL\nsimulation benchmark, outperforming the previous best method by an absolute\nmargin of 63%. In extensive real-world evaluations, SPF outperforms strong\nbaselines by a large margin. We also conduct comprehensive ablation studies to\nhighlight the effectiveness of our design choice. Lastly, SPF shows remarkable\ngeneralization to different VLMs. Project page: https://spf-web.pages.dev"}
