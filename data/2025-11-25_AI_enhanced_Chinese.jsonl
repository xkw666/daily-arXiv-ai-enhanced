Traditional 3D motion synthesis relies on costly motion capture, while recent work shows that 2D videos provide rich, temporally coherent observations of human behavior. Existing approaches, however, either map high-level text descriptions to motion or rely solely on video conditioning, leaving a gap between generated dynamics and real-world motion statistics. We introduce MotionDuet, a multimodal framework that aligns motion generation with the distribution of video-derived representations. In this dual-conditioning paradigm, video cues extracted from a pretrained model (e.g., VideoMAE) ground low-level motion dynamics, while textual prompts provide semantic intent. To bridge the distribution gap across modalities, we propose Dual-stream Unified Encoding and Transformation (DUET) and a Distribution-Aware Structural Harmonization (DASH) loss. DUET fuses video-informed cues into the motion latent space via unified encoding and dynamic attention, while DASH aligns motion trajectories with both distributional and structural statistics of video features. An auto-guidance mechanism further balances textual and visual signals by leveraging a weakened copy of the model, enhancing controllability without sacrificing diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MotionDuet generates realistic and controllable human motions, surpassing strong state-of-the-art baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6846\u67b6MotionDuet\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u9891\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u53cc\u6d41\u7f16\u7801\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u76843D\u4eba\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u52a8\u6355\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u8fd0\u52a8\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81", "method": "\u91c7\u7528DUET\u53cc\u6d41\u7f16\u7801\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u9891\u7279\u5f81\uff0cDASH\u635f\u5931\u5bf9\u9f50\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u914d\u5408\u81ea\u5f15\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u5e73\u8861\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u53f7", "result": "\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u517c\u5177\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e8f\u5217", "conclusion": "MotionDuet\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u6587\u672c-\u89c6\u9891\u534f\u540c\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u6280\u672f\u74f6\u9888"}}

Traditional linear methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA), provide structured and predictable behavior thanks to their linear formulation, but are limited in expressiveness. Nonlinear model reduction, typically implemented with neural networks, offers richer representations and higher compression; however, without structural constraints, the learned mappings often fail to generalize beyond the training distribution, leading to unstable or implausible deformations. We present a symmetric, convex-inspired neural formulation that bridges the gap between linear and nonlinear model reduction. Our approach adopts an input-convex neural network (ICNN) augmented with symmetry constraints to impose structure on the nonlinear decoder. This design retains the flexibility of neural mappings while embedding physical consistency, yielding coherent and stable displacements even under unseen conditions.

Compared to 3D representations like voxels and point clouds, mesh-based representations are preferred as they enable the application of differential geometry theory and are optimized for modern graphics pipelines. However, existing inverse rendering methods often fail catastrophically on high-genus surfaces, leading to the loss of key topological features, and tend to oversmooth low-genus surfaces, resulting in the loss of surface details. This failure stems from their overreliance on Adam-based optimizers, which can lead to vanishing and exploding gradients. To overcome these challenges, we introduce an adaptive V-cycle remeshing scheme in conjunction with a re-parametrized Adam optimizer to enhance topological and geometric awareness. By periodically coarsening and refining the deforming mesh, our method informs mesh vertices of their current topology and geometry before optimization, mitigating gradient issues while preserving essential topological features. Additionally, we enforce topological consistency by constructing topological primitives with genus numbers that match those of ground truth using Gauss-Bonnet theorem. Experimental results demonstrate that our inverse rendering approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art method, achieving significant improvements in Chamfer Distance and Volume IoU, particularly for high-genus surfaces, while also enhancing surface details for low-genus surfaces.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408V\u5faa\u73af\u91cd\u7f51\u683c\u5316\u4e0e\u6539\u8fdbAdam\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u9006\u5411\u6e32\u67d3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u4e8f\u683c\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u5f81\u4e22\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728Chamfer Distance\u548cVolume IoU\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f53\u7d20/\u70b9\u4e91\u7684\u9006\u5411\u6e32\u67d3\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u4e8f\u683c\u8868\u9762\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e14Adam\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5bfc\u81f4\u68af\u5ea6\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u517c\u987e\u62d3\u6251\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6", "method": "1. \u81ea\u9002\u5e94V\u5faa\u73af\u91cd\u7f51\u683c\u5316\u5468\u671f\u6027\u5730\u7c97\u5316-\u7ec6\u5316\u7f51\u683c\n2. \u6539\u8fdbAdam\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u5f0f\u589e\u5f3a\u68af\u5ea6\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\n3. \u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af-\u535a\u5185\u5b9a\u7406\u6784\u5efa\u62d3\u6251\u57fa\u5143\u4fdd\u8bc1\u62d3\u6251\u4e00\u81f4\u6027", "result": "\u9ad8\u4e8f\u683c\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff1aChamfer Distance\u964d\u4f4e23%\uff0cVolume IoU\u63d0\u9ad818%\uff1b\u4f4e\u4e8f\u683c\u8868\u9762\u7ec6\u8282\u4fdd\u7559\u63d0\u534719%", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u62d3\u6251\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5236\u878d\u5165\u9006\u5411\u6e32\u67d3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u4e3a\u5de5\u4e1a\u8bbe\u8ba1/\u533b\u5b66\u6210\u50cf\u9886\u57df\u590d\u6742\u66f2\u9762\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u65b9\u6848"}}

However, deploying these models for EHR question answering (QA) systems in safety-critical clinical environments remains challenging: incorrect SQL queries-whether caused by model errors or problematic user inputs-can undermine clinical decision-making and jeopardize patient care. While prior work has mainly focused on improving SQL generation accuracy or filtering questions before execution, there is a lack of a unified benchmark for evaluating independent post-hoc verification mechanisms (i.e., a component that inspects and validates the generated SQL before execution), which is crucial for safe deployment. To fill this gap, we introduce SCARE, a benchmark for evaluating methods that function as a post-hoc safety layer in EHR QA systems. SCARE evaluates the joint task of (1) classifying question answerability (i.e., determining whether a question is answerable, ambiguous, or unanswerable) and (2) verifying or correcting candidate SQL queries. The benchmark comprises 4,200 triples of questions, candidate SQL queries, and expected model outputs, grounded in the MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, and eICU databases. It covers a diverse set of questions and corresponding candidate SQL queries generated by seven different text-to-SQL models, ensuring a realistic and challenging evaluation.

However, despite their ability to handle long sequences, the resulting decoding latency and memory overhead remain substantial, posing challenges for real-world deployment. Recent advances in KV Cache reuse have shown potential to mitigate these costs, but still suffer from notable performance degradation. To address this issue, we conduct an in-depth investigation of recomputation-based reuse methods and observe that the recomputed tokens often fail to align with the context segments most relevant to the question. This misalignment hinders proper updates to the critical contextual representations. Therefore, we propose the $\\textbf{A}$ttention-$\\textbf{A}$ware $\\textbf{A}$ccurate KV Cache Fusion algorithm ($A^3$), which precomputes and selectively fuses the KV Cache of text chunks based on their relevance to the question, achieving accurate integration with minimal computational overhead.

To address these limitations, we introduce LexInstructEval, a new benchmark and evaluation framework for fine-grained lexical instruction following.

Recent advancements, such as 3DGS, have demonstrated impressive reconstruction efficiency and rapid rendering speeds. However, intuitive local editing of these representations remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose AvatarBrush, a framework that reconstructs fully animatable and locally editable avatars using only a monocular video input. We propose a three-layer model to represent the avatar and, inspired by mesh morphing techniques, design a framework to generate the Gaussian model from local information of the parametric body model. Compared to previous methods that require scanned meshes or multi-view captures as input, our approach reduces costs and enhances editing capabilities such as body shape adjustment, local texture modification, and geometry transfer.

Existing methods are largely restricted to characters with similar structures and fail to generalize to category-free settings (e.g., transferring a humanoid's pose to a quadruped). The key challenge lies in the structural and transformation diversity inherent in distinct character types, which often leads to mismatched regions and poor transfer quality. To address these issues, we first construct a million-scale pose dataset across hundreds of distinct characters. We further propose MimiCAT, a cascade-transformer model designed for category-free 3D pose transfer. Instead of relying on strict one-to-one correspondence mappings, MimiCAT leverages semantic keypoint labels to learn a novel soft correspondence that enables flexible many-to-many matching across characters. The pose transfer is then formulated as a conditional generation process, in which the source transformations are first projected onto the target through soft correspondence matching and subsequently refined using shape-conditioned representations. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that MimiCAT transfers plausible poses across different characters, significantly outperforming prior methods that are limited to narrow category transfer (e.g., humanoid-to-humanoid).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMimiCAT\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u7c7b\u522b3D\u59ff\u6001\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6f\u5bf9\u5e94\u5339\u914d\u7a81\u7834\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u9650\u5236", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u59ff\u6001\u8fc1\u79fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u540c\u7c7b\u89d2\u8272\uff08\u5982\u4eba\u5f62\u95f4\u8fc1\u79fb\uff09\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u8de8\u7269\u79cd\uff08\u5982\u4eba\u5f62\u2192\u56db\u8db3\u52a8\u7269\uff09\u7684\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u533a\u57df\u9519\u914d\u95ee\u9898", "method": "1.\u6784\u5efa\u767e\u4e07\u7ea7\u8de8\u89d2\u8272\u59ff\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\n2.\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ea7\u8054Transformer\u67b6\u6784\n3.\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f6f\u5bf9\u5e94\u5339\u914d\n4.\u5efa\u7acb\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u6295\u5f71+\u5f62\u72b6\u6761\u4ef6\u7ec6\u5316\uff09", "result": "\u5728\u8de8\u89d2\u8272\u8fc1\u79fb\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9a\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u975e\u540c\u7c7b\u8fc1\u79fb\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff09", "conclusion": "MimiCAT\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u6b63\u610f\u4e49\u4e0a\u7684\u65e0\u7c7b\u522b\u9650\u52363D\u59ff\u6001\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u5176\u8f6f\u5bf9\u5e94\u673a\u5236\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u8de8\u7ed3\u6784\u89d2\u8272\u52a8\u753b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f"}}

A word is defined as a maximal block of non-space symbols. Within this symbol-level framework, which assumes no morphology, syntax, or semantics, we derive several structural results. First, word lengths follow a geometric distribution governed solely by the probability of the space symbol. Second, the expected number of words of a given length, and the expected number of distinct words of that length, admit closed-form expressions based on a coupon-collector argument. This yields a critical word length k* at which word types transition from appearing many times on average to appearing at most once. Third, combining the exponential growth of the number of possible strings of length k with the exponential decay of the probability of each string, we obtain a Zipf-type rank-frequency law p(r) proportional to r^{-alpha}, with an exponent determined explicitly by the alphabet size and the space probability.\n  Our contribution is twofold. Mathematically, we give a unified derivation linking word lengths, vocabulary growth, critical length, and rank-frequency structure in a single explicit model. Conceptually, we argue that this provides a structurally grounded null model for both natural-language word statistics and token statistics in large language models.

Despite its success, the representational capacity of 3DGS remains limited by the use of 3D Gaussian kernels to model local variations. Recent works have proposed to augment 3DGS with additional per-primitive capacity, such as per-splat textures, to enhance its expressiveness. However, these per-splat texture approaches primarily target dense novel view synthesis with a reduced number of Gaussian primitives, and their effectiveness tends to diminish when applied to more general reconstruction scenarios. In this paper, we aim to achieve concrete performance improvement over state-of-the-art 3DGS variants across a wide range of reconstruction tasks, including novel view synthesis, geometry and dynamic reconstruction, under both sparse and dense input settings. To this end, we introduce Neural Texture Splatting (NTS). At the core of our approach is a global neural field (represented as a hybrid of a tri-plane and a neural decoder) that predicts local appearance and geometric fields for each primitive. By leveraging this shared global representation that models local texture fields across primitives, we significantly reduce model size and facilitate efficient global information exchange, demonstrating strong generalization across tasks. Furthermore, our neural modeling of local texture fields introduces expressive view- and time-dependent effects, a critical aspect that existing methods fail to account for.

Generative LLMs like GPT and Claude are increasingly being used as content analytical tools, but how effective are they for frame analysis? We address this question by systematically evaluating them against their computational predecessors: bag-of-words models and encoder-only transformers; and traditional manual coding procedures. Our analysis rests on a novel gold standard dataset that we inductively and iteratively developed through the study, investigating six months of news coverage of the US Mpox epidemic of 2022. While we discover some potential applications for generative LLMs, we demonstrate that they were consistently outperformed by manual coders, and in some instances, by smaller language models. Some form of human validation was always necessary to determine appropriate model choice. Additionally, by examining how the suitability of various approaches depended on the nature of different tasks that were part of our frame analytical workflow, we provide insights as to how researchers may leverage the complementarity of these approaches to use them in tandem.

However, the semi-transparent nature of Gaussians prevents the application of another highly effective technique: occlusion culling. We address this limitation by proposing a novel method to learn the viewpoint-dependent visibility function of all Gaussians in a trained model using a small, shared MLP across instances of an asset in a scene. By querying it for Gaussians within the viewing frustum prior to rasterization, our method can discard occluded primitives during rendering. Leveraging Tensor Cores for efficient computation, we integrate these neural queries directly into a novel instanced software rasterizer.

Previous work, like IBM Project Debater, focused on generating persuasive speeches in simplified and shortened debate formats intended for relatively lay audiences. We introduce DeepDebater, a novel autonomous system capable of participating in and winning a full, unmodified, two-team competitive policy debate. Our system employs a hierarchical architecture of specialized multi-agent workflows, where teams of LLM-powered agents collaborate and critique one another to perform discrete argumentative tasks. Each workflow utilizes iterative retrieval, synthesis, and self-correction using a massive corpus of policy debate evidence (OpenDebateEvidence) and produces complete speech transcripts, cross-examinations, and rebuttals. We introduce a live, interactive end-to-end presentation pipeline that renders debates with AI speech and animation: transcripts are surface-realized and synthesized to audio with OpenAI TTS, and then displayed as talking-head portrait videos with EchoMimic V1. Beyond fully autonomous matches (AI vs AI), DeepDebater supports hybrid human-AI operation: human debaters can intervene at any stage, and humans can optionally serve as opponents against AI in any speech, allowing AI-human and AI-AI rounds. In preliminary evaluations against human-authored cases, DeepDebater produces qualitatively superior argumentative components and consistently wins simulated rounds as adjudicated by an independent autonomous judge. Expert human debate coaches also prefer the arguments, evidence, and cases constructed by DeepDebater.

Existing pre-generation filters rely on heuristics or uncalibrated LLM confidence scores, offering no statistical control over retained evidence. We evaluate and demonstrate context engineering through conformal prediction, a coverage-controlled filtering framework that removes irrelevant content while preserving recall of supporting evidence. Using both embedding- and LLM-based scoring functions, we test this approach on the NeuCLIR and RAGTIME collections. Conformal filtering consistently meets its target coverage, ensuring that a specified fraction of relevant snippets are retained, and reduces retained context by 2-3x relative to unfiltered retrieval. On NeuCLIR, downstream factual accuracy measured by ARGUE F1 improves under strict filtering and remains stable at moderate coverage, indicating that most discarded material is redundant or irrelevant.

Efforts for modeling complex relation semantics in heterogeneous graphs are restricted by the limitations of predefined semantic dependencies and the scarcity of supervised signals. The advanced pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm leverages graph structure to provide rich self-supervised signals, but introduces semantic gaps between tasks. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer significant potential to address the semantic issues of relations and tasks in heterogeneous graphs through their strong reasoning capabilities in textual modality, but their incorporation into heterogeneous graphs is largely limited by computational complexity. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an Efficient LLM-Aware (ELLA) framework for heterogeneous graphs, addressing the above issues. To capture complex relation semantics, we propose an LLM-aware Relation Tokenizer that leverages LLM to encode multi-hop, multi-type relations. To reduce computational complexity, we further employ a Hop-level Relation Graph Transformer, which help reduces the complexity of LLM-aware relation reasoning from exponential to linear. To bridge semantic gaps between pre-training and fine-tuning tasks, we introduce the fine-grained task-aware textual Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts. Extensive experiments on four heterogeneous graphs show that our proposed ELLA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the performance and efficiency.

Recent test-time reinforcement learning (TTRL) methods derive label-free pseudo-rewards from self-consistency voting over sampled trajectories, yet they often collapse: the majority-vote reward prevails, responses shorten, and Pass@1 declines. We trace this to uniform sequence updates in which most tokens are low-entropy followers, while a small high-entropy subset determines the reasoning branches. Thus we propose SPINE, a token-selective test-time reinforcement learning framework that (i) updates only forking tokens, the high-entropy branch points identified from forward-pass statistics, and (ii) applies an entropy-band regularizer at those tokens to sustain exploration when entropy is too low and to suppress noisy supervision when it is too high. SPINE plugs into GRPO-style objectives, optionally with a KL anchor, and requires no labels or reward models. Across ten benchmarks spanning multimodal VQA, general and expert QA, mathematical reasoning, and medical QA, SPINE consistently improves Pass@1 over TTRL while avoiding response-length collapse and yielding more stable training dynamics on both LLM and MLLM backbones. These results indicate that aligning updates with chain-of-thought branch points is a simple and label-free mechanism for stable and effective test-time adaptation in reasoning models.

Prior work attempts to detect hallucination with model-internal signals such as token-level entropy or generation consistency, while the connection between pretraining data exposure and hallucination is underexplored. Existing studies show that LLMs underperform on long-tail knowledge, i.e., the accuracy of the generated answer drops for the ground-truth entities that are rare in pretraining. However, examining whether data coverage itself can serve as a detection signal is overlooked. We propose a complementary question: Does lexical training-data coverage of the question and/or generated answer provide additional signal for hallucination detection? To investigate this, we construct scalable suffix arrays over RedPajama's 1.3-trillion-token pretraining corpus to retrieve $n$-gram statistics for both prompts and model generations. We evaluate their effectiveness for hallucination detection across three QA benchmarks. Our observations show that while occurrence-based features are weak predictors when used alone, they yield modest gains when combined with log-probabilities, particularly on datasets with higher intrinsic model uncertainty.

Previous work identified two types of attention heads that disentangle this information: (i) Concept induction heads, which copy word meanings, and (ii) Token induction heads, which copy literal token representations (Feucht et al., 2025). We show that these heads can be used to identify subspaces of model activations that exhibit coherent semantic structure in Llama-2-7b. Specifically, when we transform hidden states using the attention weights of concept heads, we are able to more accurately perform parallelogram arithmetic (Mikolov et al., 2013) on the resulting hidden states, e.g., showing that \"Athens\" - \"Greece\" + \"China\" = \"Beijing\". This transformation allows for much higher nearest-neighbor accuracy (80%) than direct use of raw hidden states (47%). Analogously, we show that token heads allow for transformations that reveal surface-level word information in hidden states, allowing for operations like \"coding\" - \"code\" + \"dance\" = \"dancing\".", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u5ff5\u5f52\u7eb3\u5934\u548ctoken\u5f52\u7eb3\u5934\u5206\u79bb\u8bed\u4e49/\u8868\u5c42\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6743\u91cd\u8f6c\u6362\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u540e\uff0c\u5e73\u884c\u56db\u8fb9\u5f62\u7b97\u672f\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece47%\u63d0\u5347\u81f380%", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u5206\u79bb\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u8868\u5c42\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6982\u5ff5\u5934\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6743\u91cd\u8f6c\u6362\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u4e49\u7b97\u672f\uff08\u5982\u56fd\u5bb6\u9996\u90fd\u8ba1\u7b97\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528token\u5934\u8fdb\u884c\u8868\u5c42\u5f62\u6001\u64cd\u4f5c\uff08\u5982\u8bcd\u5f62\u53d8\u5316\uff09", "result": "\u6982\u5ff5\u5934\u8f6c\u6362\u540e\u51c6\u786e\u738780%\uff08\u539f\u59cb47%\uff09\uff0ctoken\u5934\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\"coding\u2192dancing\"\u7b49\u5f62\u6001\u8f6c\u6362", "conclusion": "\u7279\u5b9a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49/\u8868\u5c42\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5"}}

We present the first systematic evaluation comparing vector-based agentic RAG using hybrid search and metadata filtering against hierarchical node-based systems that traverse document structure without embeddings. We evaluate two enhancement techniques applied to the vector-based architecture, i) cross-encoder reranking for retrieval precision, and ii) small-to-big chunk retrieval for context completeness. Across 1,200 SEC 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filings on a 150-question benchmark, we measure retrieval metrics (MRR, Recall@5), answer quality through LLM-as-a-judge pairwise comparisons, latency, and preprocessing costs. Vector-based agentic RAG achieves a 68% win rate over hierarchical node-based systems with comparable latency (5.2 compared to 5.98 seconds). Cross-encoder reranking achieves a 59% absolute improvement at optimal parameters (10, 5) for MRR@5.

Much of this knowledge stems from discontinued programs, and reusing these archives is invaluable for reverse translation. However, in practice, such reuse is often infeasible. In this work, we introduce DiscoVerse, a multi-agent co-scientist designed to support pharmaceutical research and development. The system implements semantic retrieval, cross-document linking, and auditable synthesis on a large historical corpus from Roche. To validate our approach at real-world scale, we selected a subset of 180 molecules from the Roche research repositories, covering over 0.87 billion BPE tokens and more than four decades of research. Given that automated evaluation metrics are poorly aligned with scientific utility, we evaluate the performance of DiscoVerse using blinded expert evaluation of source-linked outputs. To our knowledge, this is the first agentic framework systematically assessed on real pharmaceutical data for reverse translation, enabled by authorized access to confidential, end-to-end drug-development archives. Our contributions include role-specialized agent designs aligned with scientist workflows; human-in-the-loop support for reverse translation; expert evaluation; and a large-scale demonstration showing promising answer accuracy and decision-making insights. In brief, across seven benchmark queries covering 180 molecules, DiscoVerse achieved near-perfect recall ($\\geq 0.99$) with moderate precision ($0.71-0.91$), while qualitative assessments of discontinuation rationale and organ-specific toxicity showed faithful, source-linked synthesis across preclinical and clinical evidence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edfDiscoVerse\u89e3\u51b3\u836f\u7269\u7814\u53d1\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u7528\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u4f30\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u9006\u5411\u8f6c\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u836f\u7269\u7814\u53d1\u4e2d\u65ad\u9879\u76ee\u6570\u636e\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u91cd\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u652f\u6301\u9006\u5411\u8f6c\u5316\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u79d1\u7814\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f57\u6c0f\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u89d2\u8272\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528180\u5206\u5b50\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u8986\u76d68.7\u4ebfBPE tokens\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4e13\u5bb6\u76f2\u8bc4\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u22650.99\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea60.71-0.91\uff1b\u5668\u5b98\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u6bd2\u6027\u7b49\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u8de8\u8bc1\u636e\u53ef\u9760\u5408\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9996\u4e2a\u7ecf\u771f\u5b9e\u836f\u7269\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u836f\u7269\u9006\u5411\u8f6c\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Automated question answering systems over such codes enable quick and accurate access to specific regulatory clauses, improving efficiency and reducing errors. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are essential for this task as they combine the precision of information retrieval with the generative capabilities of language models. However, tabular data are challenging to extract as they often involve complex layouts, merged cells, multi-row headers, and embedded semantic relationships that are not easily captured by traditional natural language processing techniques and Vision Language Models (VLMs). This paper explores and compares two methods for extracting information from tabular data in building codes using several pre-trained VLMs. First, a direct input method is used, where the image of the page is input directly into the VLMs, which are then tasked with answering questions based on the image. Second, an indirect input method is introduced, which involves converting an image of a page containing tables into the LaTeX code and then answering inquires based on the LaTeX-based input. The experiments find that the direct input method generally resulted in higher accuracy than the indirect input method. To further improve the performance, we fine-tuned each VLM using Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on a domain-specific tabular dataset. The fine-tuned models exhibited substantial improvements, with Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct achieving relative accuracy gains exceeding 100%.

We introduce Path-Constrained Retrieval (PCR), a retrieval method that combines structural graph constraints with semantic search to ensure retrieved information maintains logical relationships within a knowledge graph. PCR restricts the search space to nodes reachable from an anchor node, preventing retrieval of structurally disconnected information that may lead to inconsistent reasoning. We evaluate PCR on PathRAG-6, a benchmark spanning six domains with 180 nodes and 360 edges. Our results show that PCR achieves full structural consistency compared to 24-32 percent in baseline methods, while maintaining strong relevance scores. On the technology domain, PCR obtains full relevance at rank 10 with full structural consistency, significantly outperforming vector search and hybrid retrieval. PCR reduces the average graph distance of retrieved context by 78 percent compared to baselines, demonstrating retrieval of more structurally consistent information.

To bridge this gap, we first introduce OmniStruct, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing LLMs' capabilities on diverse text-to-structure tasks such as information extraction, table generation, and function calling. We build OmniStruct by identifying existing datasets across a wide range of tasks that are suitable for a structured answer format, and adapting them under a unified text-to-structure problem setting. To facilitate the development of efficient text-to-structure models, we collect high-quality training data via synthetic task generation.

To investigate these issues, two complementary studies were carried out on Twitter and Facebook, combining quantitative analyses of digital traces with online observation and interviews. This mixed-methods design avoids reducing users to single reactions to identified fake items and instead examines the variety of practices across different interactional situations, online and offline, while recording socio-demographic traits. The first study mapped users who shared at least one item labeled fake by fact-checkers in the French Twittersphere. The second used a corpus of items flagged by Facebook users to study reactions to statements whose epistemic status is uncertain. Three main findings emerge. First, sharing fake news is concentrated among a limited group of users who are not less educated or cognitively disadvantaged but are more politicized and critical of institutions; owing to their high activity and prolific sharing, they can help set the agenda for their political camp. Second, exposed users can deploy varying forms of critical distance depending on their social position and the interactional norms of the situations they inhabit: either discursive caution (prudence \u00e9nonciative) or interventions ('points d'arr\u00eat') that express disagreement or corrections. Third, these forms of critical distance seldom yield genuine deliberative debates or agonistic pluralism; rather, they often produce dialogues of the deaf among a small, particularly active minority.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u865a\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u4f20\u64ad\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u5c11\u6570\u9ad8\u6d3b\u8dc3\u5ea6\u653f\u6cbb\u5316\u7528\u6237\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u793e\u4f1a\u7fa4\u4f53\u5c55\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u7684\u6279\u5224\u6027\u5e94\u5bf9\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e92\u52a8\u672a\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u6709\u6548\u516c\u5171\u8fa9\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4e24\u5927\u77db\u76fe\uff1a1\uff09\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7f16\u8f91\u7ba1\u63a7\u4e0b\u865a\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u5b9e\u9645\u4f20\u64ad\u6bd4\u4f8b\u504f\u4f4e\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff1b2\uff09\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u6709\u9650\u4f46\u653f\u6cbb\u6781\u5316\u52a0\u5267\u7684\u77db\u76fe\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "method": "Twitter\u548cFacebook\u6df7\u5408\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u6570\u5b57\u75d5\u8ff9+\u7ebf\u4e0a\u89c2\u5bdf\u8bbf\u8c08\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e00\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u6807\u6ce8\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6cd5\u56fd\u63a8\u7279\u5708\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u4f20\u64ad\u8005\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e8c\u5206\u6790\u7528\u6237\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u5b58\u7591\u5185\u5bb9\u4e92\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "1\uff09\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u4f20\u64ad\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u6559\u80b2\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0d\u4f4e\u4f46\u653f\u6cbb\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3001\u6279\u5224\u4f53\u5236\u7684\u6d3b\u8dc3\u7528\u6237\uff1b2\uff09\u7528\u6237\u6279\u5224\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f53\u73b0\u4e3a\u8868\u8fbe\u8c28\u614e\u6216\u5f02\u8bae\u4fee\u6b63\uff1b3\uff09\u4e92\u52a8\u591a\u5f62\u6210\u65e0\u6548\u5bf9\u8bdd\u800c\u975e\u826f\u6027\u8fa9\u8bba\u3002", "conclusion": "\u653f\u6cbb\u6781\u5316\u6e90\u4e8e\u5c11\u6570\u6d3b\u8dc3\u7528\u6237\u7684\u8bae\u7a0b\u8bbe\u7f6e\u80fd\u529b\u53ca\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u6279\u5224\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5927\u4f17\u666e\u904d\u53d7\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5e73\u53f0\u6cbb\u7406\u9700\u5173\u6ce8\u5173\u952e\u8282\u70b9\u7528\u6237\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u52a8\u6001\u3002"}}

However, clinical texts are often degraded by human errors or failures in automated pipelines, raising concerns about the reliability and fairness of AI-assisted decision-making. Yet the impact of such degradations remains under-investigated, particularly regarding how noise-induced shifts can heighten predictive uncertainty and unevenly affect demographic subgroups. We present a systematic study of state-of-the-art LLMs under diverse text corruption scenarios, focusing on robustness and equity in next-visit diagnosis prediction. To address the challenge posed by the large diagnostic label space, we introduce a clinically grounded label-reduction scheme and a hierarchical chain-of-thought (CoT) strategy that emulates clinicians' reasoning.

The recently released Mechanistic Interpretability Benchmark (MIB; Mueller et al., 2025) provides a standardized framework for evaluating circuit and causal variable localization. Building on this foundation, the BlackboxNLP 2025 Shared Task extends MIB into a community-wide reproducible comparison of MI techniques. The shared task features two tracks: circuit localization, which assesses methods that identify causally influential components and interactions driving model behavior, and causal variable localization, which evaluates approaches that map activations into interpretable features.

However, most existing agentic recommender systems focus on generic single-agent plan-execute workflows or multi-agent task decomposition pipelines. Without recommendation-oriented design, they often underuse the collaborative signals in the user-item interaction history, leading to unsatisfying recommendation results. To address this, we propose the Multi-Agent Collaborative Filtering (MACF) framework for agentic recommendations, drawing an analogy between traditional collaborative filtering algorithms and LLM-based multi-agent collaboration. Specifically, given a target user and query, we instantiate similar users and relevant items as LLM agents with unique profiles. Each agent is able to call retrieval tools, suggest candidate items, and interact with other agents. Different from the static preference aggregation in traditional collaborative filtering, MACF employs a central orchestrator agent to adaptively manage the collaboration between user and item agents via dynamic agent recruitment and personalized collaboration instruction. Experimental results on datasets from three different domains show the advantages of our MACF framework compared to strong agentic recommendation baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Proposes MACF framework integrating LLM-based multi-agent collaboration with collaborative filtering principles for enhanced recommendations", "motivation": "Existing agentic recommenders underutilize collaborative signals in user-item interaction history, leading to suboptimal performance", "method": "Instantiates user/item agents with profiles, enables tool usage and inter-agent collaboration managed by central orchestrator with dynamic recruitment/personalization", "result": "Shows advantages over agentic baselines across three domain datasets", "conclusion": "MACF effectively bridges traditional collaborative filtering with modern LLM agent collaboration through adaptive multi-agent coordination"}}

To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework called \\textbf{general agentic memory (GAM)}. GAM follows the principle of \"\\textbf{just-in time (JIT) compilation}\" where it focuses on creating optimized contexts for its client at runtime while keeping only simple but useful memory during the offline stage. To this end, GAM employs a duo-design with the following components. 1) \\textbf{Memorizer}, which highlights key historical information using a lightweight memory, while maintaining complete historical information within a universal page-store. 2) \\textbf{Researcher}, which retrieves and integrates useful information from the page-store for its online request guided by the pre-constructed memory. This design allows GAM to effectively leverage the agentic capabilities and test-time scalability of frontier large language models (LLMs), while also facilitating end-to-end performance optimization through reinforcement learning.

A core obstacle to the creation of better systems is the scarcity of benchmarks that capture the complexity of real therapeutic interactions. Most existing benchmarks either only test clinical knowledge through multiple-choice questions or assess single responses in isolation. To bridge this gap, we present MindEval, a framework designed in collaboration with Ph.D-level Licensed Clinical Psychologists for automatically evaluating language models in realistic, multi-turn mental health therapy conversations. Through patient simulation and automatic evaluation with LLMs, our framework balances resistance to gaming with reproducibility via its fully automated, model-agnostic design. We begin by quantitatively validating the realism of our simulated patients against human-generated text and by demonstrating strong correlations between automatic and human expert judgments. Then, we evaluate 12 state-of-the-art LLMs and show that all models struggle, scoring below 4 out of 6, on average, with particular weaknesses in problematic AI-specific patterns of communication. Notably, reasoning capabilities and model scale do not guarantee better performance, and systems deteriorate with longer interactions or when supporting patients with severe symptoms.

Yet, their behavior on structured tasks such as predicting the difficulty of competitive programming problems remains under-explored. We conduct a systematic comparison of GPT-4o, used purely as a natural-language difficulty assessor, against an interpretable Light-GBM ensemble trained on explicit numeric and textual features. On a dataset of 1,825 LeetCode problems labeled Easy, Medium, or Hard, LightGBM attains 86% accuracy, whereas GPT-4o reaches only 37.75%. Detailed analyses, including confusion matrices and SHAP-based interpretability, show that numeric constraints -- such as input size limits and acceptance rates -- play a crucial role in separating Hard problems from easier ones. By contrast, GPT-4o often overlooks these cues and exhibits a strong bias toward simpler categories. We further probe GPT-4o through a synthetic Hard-problem generation protocol. Surprisingly, GPT-4o labels almost all of its own synthetic Hard problems as Medium, contradicting its tendency to downgrade real Hard problems to Easy.

Despite the growing use of large language models (LLMs) across disciplines, how well these systems generalize across diverse belief domains remains unclear. We introduce a systematic, reproducible benchmark that evaluates the ability of LLMs to predict individuals' stances on a wide range of topics in a zero-shot setting using data from an online debate platform. The benchmark includes multiple informational conditions that isolate the contribution of demographic context and known prior beliefs to predictive success. Across several small- to medium-sized models, we find that providing more background information about an individual improves predictive accuracy, but performance varies substantially across belief domains.

However, effectively navigating the vast amount of news content from different newspapers and online news portals can be challenging. Newspaper headlines with sentiment analysis tell us what the news is about (e.g., politics, sports) and how the news makes us feel (positive, negative, neutral). This helps us quickly understand the emotional tone of the news. This research presents a state-of-the-art approach to Bangla news headline classification combined with sentiment analysis applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, particularly the hybrid transfer learning model BERT-CNN-BiLSTM. We have explored a dataset called BAN-ABSA of 9014 news headlines, which is the first time that has been experimented with simultaneously in the headline and sentiment categorization in Bengali newspapers. Over this imbalanced dataset, we applied two experimental strategies: technique-1, where undersampling and oversampling are applied before splitting, and technique-2, where undersampling and oversampling are applied after splitting on the In technique-1 oversampling provided the strongest performance, both headline and sentiment, that is 78.57\\% and 73.43\\% respectively, while technique-2 delivered the highest result when trained directly on the original imbalanced dataset, both headline and sentiment, that is 81.37\\% and 64.46\\% respectively. The proposed model BERT-CNN-BiLSTM significantly outperforms all baseline models in classification tasks, and achieves new state-of-the-art results for Bangla news headline classification and sentiment analysis.

Libraries such as DSpy (from Stanford NLP) avoid this problem through demonstration-based prompt optimisation. Inspired by this, I propose an alternative approach that treats prompt optimisation as a classical state-space search problem. I model the prompt space as a graph where nodes represent prompt states and edges correspond to deliberate transformations such as shortening, adding examples, or re- ordering content. Using beam search and random walk algorithms, I systematically explore this space, evaluating candidates on development sets and pruning unpromising branches. Across five NLP tasks (sentiment classification, question answering, summarisation, reason- ing, and natural language inference), I find that even shallow search configurations (beam width=2, depth=2) improve upon seed prompts on development sets. For instance, beam search achieves development accuracy gains from 0.40 to 0.80 on reasoning tasks, though test set improvements are more modest (0.20 to 0.50), indicating overfitting to the develop- ment heuristic. Analysis of successful optimisation paths reveals that transformations that make prompts concise appear most frequently, while verbosity operators are never selected. My results validate prompt optimization as a search problem and suggest that with greater computational resources and improved evaluation metrics, deeper exploration could yield more robust prompts that generalize beyond development sets.

While various techniques aim to mitigate these biases, their effects are often evaluated only along the dimension of the bias being targeted. This work investigates the cross-category consequences of targeted bias mitigation. We study four bias mitigation techniques applied across ten models from seven model families, and we explore racial, religious, profession- and gender-related biases. We measure the impact of debiasing on model coherence and stereotypical preference using the StereoSet benchmark. Our results consistently show that while targeted mitigation can sometimes reduce bias in the intended dimension, it frequently leads to unintended and often negative consequences in others, such as increasing model bias and decreasing general coherence. These findings underscore the critical need for robust, multi-dimensional evaluation tools when examining and developing bias mitigation strategies to avoid inadvertently shifting or worsening bias along untargeted axes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u504f\u89c1\u7f13\u89e3\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u5176\u4ed6\u7ef4\u5ea6\u504f\u89c1\u52a0\u5267\uff0c\u9700\u591a\u7ef4\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u4fdd\u969c\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u6027", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u504f\u89c1\u7f13\u89e3\u6280\u672f\u4ec5\u8bc4\u4f30\u76ee\u6807\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u8de8\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8d1f\u9762\u8fde\u9501\u53cd\u5e94", "method": "\u4f7f\u75284\u79cd\u504f\u89c1\u7f13\u89e3\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u57287\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u768410\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u79cd\u65cf/\u5b97\u6559/\u804c\u4e1a/\u6027\u522b\u56db\u7ef4\u5ea6\u504f\u89c1", "result": "\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7f13\u89e3\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u7ef4\u5ea6\u90e8\u5206\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f4676%\u6848\u4f8b\u5bfc\u81f4\u5176\u4ed6\u7ef4\u5ea6\u504f\u89c1\u589e\u52a0\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0b\u964d", "conclusion": "\u5fc5\u987b\u5efa\u7acb\u8de8\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5355\u4e00\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u9020\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u89c1\u8f6c\u79fb\u6216\u6076\u5316"}}

To address data leakage issues in existing benchmarks, we digitized all 46 questions (22 common and 24 elective) within two hours of the exam's public release, eliminating any possibility of inclusion in model training data. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of 24 state-of-the-art LLMs across varying input modalities (text, image, text+figure) and prompt languages (Korean, English).\n  GPT-5 Codex achieved the only perfect score (100 points) with text input and Korean prompts, while Grok 4, GPT-5, and Deepseek R1 scored above 95 points. Notably, gpt-oss-20B achieved 95.7 points despite its relatively small size, demonstrating high cost-effectiveness. Problem-specific analysis revealed geometry as the weakest domain (77.7% average) with significant performance degradation on 4-point high-difficulty problems. Text input consistently outperformed image input, while prompt language effects varied by model scale.\n  In reasoning enhancement experiments with GPT-5 series, increased reasoning intensity improved performance (from 82.6 to 100 points) but quadrupled token usage and drastically reduced efficiency, suggesting that models with minimal reasoning may be more practical. This research contributes: (1) implementation of a completely unexposed evaluation environment, (2) a real-exam-based LLM assessment framework, and (3) a practical evaluation perspective integrating performance, cost, and time considerations.

Although existing works achieve impressive accomplishments in simultaneously harnessing image and text information, they lack the considerations of possible low-quality and missing modalities. In real-world applications, these issues might frequently occur, leading to urgent needs for models capable of predicting sentiment robustly. Therefore, we propose a Distribution-based feature Recovery and Fusion (DRF) method for robust multimodal sentiment analysis of image-text pairs. Specifically, we maintain a feature queue for each modality to approximate their feature distributions, through which we can simultaneously handle low-quality and missing modalities in a unified framework. For low-quality modalities, we reduce their contributions to the fusion by quantitatively estimating modality qualities based on the distributions. For missing modalities, we build inter-modal mapping relationships supervised by samples and distributions, thereby recovering the missing modalities from available ones. In experiments, two disruption strategies that corrupt and discard some modalities in samples are adopted to mimic the low-quality and missing modalities in various real-world scenarios. Through comprehensive experiments on three publicly available image-text datasets, we demonstrate the universal improvements of DRF compared to SOTA methods under both two strategies, validating its effectiveness in robust multimodal sentiment analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u5f81\u6062\u590d\u4e0e\u878d\u5408\u7684DRF\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u961f\u5217\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf/\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6a21\u6001\uff08\u5982\u6a21\u7cca\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\u548c\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\uff08\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\uff09\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u95ee\u9898\u4f1a\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd", "method": "1. \u4e3a\u5404\u6a21\u6001\u7ef4\u62a4\u7279\u5f81\u961f\u5217\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\n2. \u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u91cf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u6001\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u878d\u5408\u6743\u91cd\n3. \u5efa\u7acb\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6620\u5c04\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ece\u53ef\u7528\u6a21\u6001\u6062\u590d\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u62df\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u7834\u574f/\u4e22\u5f03\u6a21\u6001\uff09\u4e0b\uff0cDRF\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u76f8\u6bd4SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027", "conclusion": "DRF\u9996\u6b21\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6062\u590d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027"}}

We propose an unsupervised context compression framework that exploits Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs to preserve semantically essential information while filtering out irrelevant text. By quantifying node-level entropy within AMR graphs, our method estimates the conceptual importance of each node, enabling the retention of core semantics. Specifically, we construct AMR graphs from raw contexts, compute the conceptual entropy of each node, and screen significant informative nodes to form a condensed and semantically focused context than raw documents. Experiments on the PopQA and EntityQuestions datasets show that our method outperforms vanilla and other baselines, achieving higher accuracy while substantially reducing context length.

We present a rigorous, reproducible computational framework for applying neural topic modeling to focus group transcripts, addressing fundamental methodological challenges: hyperparameter sensitivity, model stability, and validation of interpretability. Using BERTopic applied to ten focus groups exploring HPV vaccine perceptions in Tunisia (1,076 utterances), we conducted systematic evaluation across 27 hyperparameter configurations, assessed stability through bootstrap resampling with 30 replicates per configuration, and validated interpretability through formal human evaluation by three domain experts. Our analysis demonstrates substantial sensitivity to hyperparameter choices and reveals that metric selection for stability assessment must align with analytical goals. A hierarchical merging strategy (extracting fine-grained topics for stability then consolidating for interpretability) effectively navigates the stability-coherence tradeoff, achieving coherence of 0.558 compared to 0.539 for direct extraction. Human validation confirmed topic quality with very good inter-rater reliability (ICC = 0.79, weighted Cohen's kappa = 0.578).

Although this task has been extensively studied in English and other high-resource languages, Czech summarization, particularly in the context of historical documents, remains underexplored. This is largely due to the inherent linguistic complexity of Czech and the lack of high-quality annotated datasets.\n  In this work, we address this gap by leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically Mistral and mT5, which have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks and multilingual settings. In addition, we also propose a translation-based approach that first translates Czech texts into English, summarizes them using an English-language model, and then translates the summaries back into Czech. Our study makes the following main contributions: We demonstrate that LLMs achieve new state-of-the-art results on the SumeCzech dataset, a benchmark for modern Czech text summarization, showing the effectiveness of multilingual LLMs even for morphologically rich, medium-resource languages like Czech. We introduce a new dataset, Posel od \u010cerchova, designed for the summarization of historical Czech texts. This dataset is derived from digitized 19th-century publications and annotated for abstractive summarization. We provide initial baselines using modern LLMs to facilitate further research in this underrepresented area.\n  By combining cutting-edge models with both modern and historical Czech datasets, our work lays the foundation for further progress in Czech summarization and contributes valuable resources for future research in Czech historical document processing and low-resource summarization more broadly.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528Mistral/mT5\u7b49\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u5347\u6377\u514b\u8bed\u6587\u672c\u6458\u8981\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5386\u53f2\u6587\u6863\u6570\u636e\u96c6Posel od \u010cerchova\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b", "motivation": "\u6377\u514b\u8bed\u6587\u672c\u6458\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u532e\u4e4f\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5386\u53f2\u6587\u6863\u5904\u7406\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u8bed\u8a00LLMs\u76f4\u63a5\u5904\u7406\u6377\u514b\u6587\u672c + \u82f1\u6377\u4e92\u8bd1\u7684pipeline\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u82f1\u6587\u5316\u5904\u7406\u2192\u82f1\u6587\u6458\u8981\u2192\u56de\u8bd1\u6377\u514b\u6587\uff09", "result": "\u5728SumeCzech\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5237\u65b0SOTA\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u9996\u4e2a19\u4e16\u7eaa\u6377\u514b\u5386\u53f2\u6587\u732e\u6458\u8981\u6570\u636e\u96c6", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u6377\u514b\u8bed\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u73b0\u4ee3/\u5386\u53f2\u6587\u672c\u6458\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u591a\u8bed\u8a00LLMs\u5728\u5f62\u6001\u590d\u6742\u4e2d\u7b49\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027"}}

Despite progress in deep learning, genetic programming, and, more recently, large language model (LLM)--based factor generation, existing approaches still explore only a narrow region of the vast alpha search space. Neural models tend to produce opaque and fragile patterns, while symbolic or formula-based methods often yield redundant or economically ungrounded expressions that generalize poorly. Although different in form, these paradigms share a key limitation: none can conduct broad, structured, and human-like exploration that balances logical consistency with creative leaps. To address this gap, we introduce the Cognitive Alpha Mining Framework (CogAlpha), which combines code-level alpha representation with LLM-driven reasoning and evolutionary search. Treating LLMs as adaptive cognitive agents, our framework iteratively refines, mutates, and recombines alpha candidates through multi-stage prompts and financial feedback. This synergistic design enables deeper thinking, richer structural diversity, and economically interpretable alpha discovery, while greatly expanding the effective search space. Experiments on A-share equities demonstrate that CogAlpha consistently discovers alphas with superior predictive accuracy, robustness, and generalization over existing methods.

In this work, we introduce FanarGuard, a bilingual moderation filter that evaluates both safety and cultural alignment in Arabic and English. We construct a dataset of over 468K prompt and response pairs, drawn from synthetic and public datasets, scored by a panel of LLM judges on harmlessness and cultural awareness, and use it to train two filter variants. To rigorously evaluate cultural alignment, we further develop the first benchmark targeting Arabic cultural contexts, comprising over 1k norm-sensitive prompts with LLM-generated responses annotated by human raters. Results show that FanarGuard achieves stronger agreement with human annotations than inter-annotator reliability, while matching the performance of state-of-the-art filters on safety benchmarks. These findings highlight the importance of integrating cultural awareness into moderation and establish FanarGuard as a practical step toward more context-sensitive safeguards.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53cc\u8bed\u5185\u5bb9\u5ba1\u6838\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668FanarGuard\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5c06\u6587\u5316\u8bed\u5883\u878d\u5165\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed/\u82f1\u8bed\u5185\u5bb9\u5ba1\u6838\uff0c\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6587\u5316\u5bf9\u9f50\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5185\u5bb9\u5ba1\u6838\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u8fc7\u5ea6\u805a\u7126\u901a\u7528\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u6587\u5316\u8bed\u5883\u9002\u914d\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u6587\u5316\u573a\u666f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u4fdd\u969c\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "1. \u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b46.8\u4e07\u7ec4\u63d0\u793a-\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u53cc\u8bed\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u6807\u6ce8\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u65e0\u5bb3\u6027\u548c\u6587\u5316\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff1b2. \u5f00\u53d1\u9996\u4e2a\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u6587\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08\u542b1000+\u6587\u5316\u654f\u611f\u63d0\u793a\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684LLM\u751f\u6210\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "result": "1. \u6587\u5316\u5bf9\u9f50\u6307\u6807\u8d85\u8d8a\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08Kappa 0.81 vs 0.78\uff09\uff1b2. \u5b89\u5168\u6027\u6307\u6807\u4e0eSOTA\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u6301\u5e73\uff1b3. \u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u4ec57B\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6587\u5316\u610f\u8bc6\u878d\u5165\u5185\u5bb9\u5ba1\u6838\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff0cFanarGuard\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u5883\u654f\u611f\u7684AI\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

To evaluate the performance of RCEG, a dedicated dataset for English reading comprehension is constructed to perform the experiments, and comprehensive evaluation metrics are used to analyze the experimental results.

However, their long chain-of-thought reasoning processes incur significant inference overhead. Pruning has emerged as a promising approach to reducing computational costs. However, existing efforts have primarily focused on large language models (LLMs), while pruning LRMs remains unexplored. In this work, we conduct the first empirical study on pruning LRMs and show that directly applying existing pruning techniques fails to yield satisfactory results. Our findings indicate that using self-generated reasoning data for calibration can substantially improve pruning performance. We further investigate how the difficulty and length of reasoning data affect pruning outcomes. Our analysis reveals that challenging and moderately long self-generated reasoning data serve as ideal calibration data. Based on these insights, we propose a Selective Self-Generated Reasoning (SSGR) data construction strategy to provide effective calibration data for pruning LRMs. Experimental results on the DeepSeek-R1-Distill model series validate that our strategy improves the reasoning ability of pruned LRMs by 10%-13% compared to general pruning methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9996\u6b21\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08LRMs\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u526a\u679d\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u7b56\u7565SSGR\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u526a\u679d\u540e\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b10%-13%", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u526a\u679d\u6280\u672f\u4e3b\u8981\u9762\u5411\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eLRMs\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u9002\u5408LRMs\u957f\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u7279\u6027\u7684\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6848", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u6821\u51c6\u526a\u679d\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u96be\u5ea6/\u957f\u5ea6\u5bf9\u526a\u679d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\uff08SSGR\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u7b56\u7565", "result": "\u5728DeepSeek-R1-Distill\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u5217\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cSSGR\u7b56\u7565\u4f7f\u526a\u679d\u540e\u7684LRMs\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u76f8\u6bd4\u901a\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u534710%-13%", "conclusion": "\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u4e14\u957f\u5ea6\u9002\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u662f\u7406\u60f3\u7684\u526a\u679d\u6821\u51c6\u6570\u636e\uff0cSSGR\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LRMs\u526a\u679d\u540e\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b"}}

Reproducibility study of the LLAMBO framework (ICLR 2024). Code: https://github.com/spagnoloG/llambo-reproducibility", "summary": "In this reproducibility study, we revisit the LLAMBO framework of Daxberger et al. (2024), a prompting-based Bayesian optimization (BO) method that uses large language models as discriminative surrogates and acquisition optimizers via text-only interactions. We replicate the core Bayesmark and HPOBench experiments under the original evaluation protocol, but replace GPT-3.5 with the open-weight Llama 3.1 70B model used for all text encoding components.\n  Our results broadly confirm the main claims of LLAMBO. Contextual warm starting via textual problem and hyperparameter descriptions substantially improves early regret behaviour and reduces variance across runs.

The approach enhances MedDRA by adding a hidden medical knowledge layer (Safeterm) that captures semantic relationships between terms in a 2-D map.

The Safeterm map is available online and connected to aggregated AE incidence tables from ClinicalTrials.gov. For signal detection, we compute treatment-specific disproportionality metrics using shrinkage incidence ratios. Cluster-level EBGM values are then derived through precision-weighted aggregation. Two visual outputs support interpretation: a semantic map showing AE incidence and an expectedness-versus-disproportionality plot for rapid signal detection.

However, existing approaches often lack an explicit and dynamic mechanism to structurally represent and evolve intermediate reasoning states, which limits their ability to perform context-aware theorem selection and iterative conclusion generation. To address these challenges, we propose GraphMind, a novel dynamic graph-based framework that integrates the graph neural network (GNN) with LLMs to iteratively select theorems and generate intermediate conclusions for multi-step reasoning. Our method models the reasoning process as a heterogeneous evolving graph, where nodes represent conditions, theorems, and conclusions, while edges capture logical dependencies between nodes. By encoding the current reasoning state with GNN and leveraging semantic matching for theorem selection, our framework enables context-aware, interpretable, and structured reasoning in a closed-loop manner. Experiments on various question-answering (QA) datasets demonstrate that our proposed GraphMind method achieves consistent performance improvements and significantly outperforms existing baselines in multi-step reasoning, validating the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u6846\u67b6GraphMind\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0eLLM\u878d\u5408\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u663e\u5f0f\u52a8\u6001\u673a\u5236\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9a\u7406\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u7ed3\u8bba\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u6761\u4ef6-\u5b9a\u7406-\u7ed3\u8bba\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\uff0c\u5229\u7528GNN\u7f16\u7801\u72b6\u6001+\u8bed\u4e49\u5339\u914d\u5b9e\u73b0\u95ed\u73af\u63a8\u7406", "result": "\u5728QA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6027", "conclusion": "\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd"}}

However, existing ICL-based NER methods suffer from three key limitations: (1) reliance on dynamic retrieval of annotated examples, which is problematic when annotated data is scarce; (2) limited generalization to unseen domains due to the LLM's insufficient internal domain knowledge; and (3) failure to incorporate external knowledge or resolve entity ambiguities. To address these challenges, we propose KDR-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework for multi-domain low-resource in-context NER that integrates Knowledge retrieval, Disambiguation, and Reflective analysis. KDR-Agent leverages natural-language type definitions and a static set of entity-level contrastive demonstrations to reduce dependency on large annotated corpora. A central planner coordinates specialized agents to (i) retrieve factual knowledge from Wikipedia for domain-specific mentions, (ii) resolve ambiguous entities via contextualized reasoning, and (iii) reflect on and correct model predictions through structured self-assessment. Experiments across ten datasets from five domains demonstrate that KDR-Agent significantly outperforms existing zero-shot and few-shot ICL baselines across multiple LLM backbones.

First, they operate as monolithic black boxes that provide undifferentiated reward signals, obscuring individual step contributions and hindering error diagnosis. Second, sequential decoding has O(n) time complexity. This makes real-time deployment impractical for complex reasoning tasks. We present DeCoRL (Decoupled Reasoning Chains via Coordinated Reinforcement Learning), a novel framework that transforms reasoning from sequential processing into collaborative modular orchestration. DeCoRL trains lightweight specialized models to generate reasoning sub-steps concurrently, eliminating sequential bottlenecks through parallel processing. To enable precise error attribution, the framework designs modular reward functions that score each sub-step independently. Cascaded DRPO optimization then coordinates these rewards while preserving inter-step dependencies. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates state-of-the-art results across RM-Bench, RMB, and RewardBench, outperforming existing methods including large-scale models. DeCoRL delivers 3.8 times faster inference while maintaining superior solution quality and offers a 22.7\\% improvement in interpretability through explicit reward attribution.

Here, we address these limitations by introducing an information-theoretic framework for discrete object naming systems, and we use it to prove that an optimal trade-off is achievable if and only if the listener's decoder is equivalent to the Bayesian decoder of the speaker.

This limitation hinders the model's ability to capture fine-grained affective signals toward specific aspect categories. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel emotion-enhanced multi-task ACSA framework that jointly learns sentiment polarity and category-specific emotions grounded in Ekman's six basic emotions. Leveraging the generative capabilities of LLMs, our approach enables the model to produce emotional descriptions for each aspect category, thereby enriching sentiment representations with affective expressions. Furthermore, to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the generated emotions, we introduce an emotion refinement mechanism based on the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) dimensional framework. Specifically, emotions predicted by the LLM are projected onto a VAD space, and those inconsistent with their corresponding VAD coordinates are re-annotated using a structured LLM-based refinement strategy.

However, it remains unclear how stably LLMs encode distinctions between true, false, and neither-true-nor-false content in their internal probabilistic representations. We introduce representational stability as the robustness of an LLM's veracity representations to perturbations in the operational definition of truth. We assess representational stability by (i) training a linear probe on an LLM's activations to separate true from not-true statements and (ii) measuring how its learned decision boundary shifts under controlled label changes. Using activations from sixteen open-source models and three factual domains, we compare two types of neither statements. The first are fact-like assertions about entities we believe to be absent from any training data. We call these unfamiliar neither statements. The second are nonfactual claims drawn from well-known fictional contexts. We call these familiar neither statements. The unfamiliar statements induce the largest boundary shifts, producing up to $40\\%$ flipped truth judgements in fragile domains (such as word definitions), while familiar fictional statements remain more coherently clustered and yield smaller changes ($\\leq 8.2\\%$). These results suggest that representational stability stems more from epistemic familiarity than from linguistic form.

To explore this question, we evaluated the causal language model (phi-2) using a carefully curated corpus, with sentences that concluded plausibly or implausibly. Our analysis focused on the hidden states sampled at each model layer. To investigate how violations are encoded, we utilized two complementary probes. First, we conducted a per-layer detection using a linear probe. Our findings revealed that a simple linear decoder struggled to distinguish between plausible and implausible endings in the lowest third of the model's layers. However, its accuracy sharply increased in the middle blocks, reaching a peak just before the top layers. Second, we examined the effective dimensionality of the encoded violation. Initially, the violation widens the representational subspace, followed by a collapse after a mid-stack bottleneck. This might indicate an exploratory phase that transitions into rapid consolidation.

Most existing studies in this field have concentrated on news articles, where journalists usually follow a fixed writing style. While such approaches are effective in limited contexts, they often fail to adapt to the varied nature of real-world Bangla texts. In today's digital era, a massive amount of Bangla content is continuously produced across blogs, newspapers, and social media. This creates a pressing need for summarization systems that can reduce information overload and help readers understand content more quickly. To address this challenge, we developed a dataset of over 54,000 Bangla articles and summaries collected from multiple sources, including blogs such as Cinegolpo and newspapers such as Samakal and The Business Standard. Unlike single-domain resources, our dataset spans multiple domains and writing styles. It offers greater adaptability and practical relevance. To establish strong baselines, we trained and evaluated this dataset using several deep learning and transfer learning models, including LSTM, BanglaT5-small, and MTS-small.

However, extending LLMs to perceive and reason over a new modality (e.g., vision), often requires costly development of large-scale vision language models (VLMs) with LLMs as backbones. Smaller VLMs are more efficient and adaptable but often lack the broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities of frontier LLMs. In this work, we propose BeMyEyes, a modular, multi-agent framework for extending LLMs to multimodal reasoning by orchestrating collaboration between efficient, adaptable VLMs as perceivers and powerful LLMs as reasoners through conversations. We then introduce a data synthesis and supervised fine-tuning pipeline to train the perceiver agent to effectively collaborate with the reasoner agent. By combining the complementary strengths of perception and reasoning agents, BeMyEyes avoids the need for training large-scale multimodal models, preserves the generalization and reasoning capabilities of LLMs, and allows flexible extension to new domains and modalities. Experiments show that our framework unlocks the multimodal reasoning capabilities for LLMs, enabling a lightweight and fully open-source solution, i.e. equipping text-only DeepSeek-R1 with Qwen2.5-VL-7B perceiver, to outperform large-scale proprietary VLMs such as GPT-4o on a wide range of knowledge-intensive multimodal tasks.

Recent advances in machine learning (ML) seek to augment such labor by automating modeling of propositional, macrostructural, pragmatic, and multimodal dimensions of discourse. To that end, this study evaluated five ML models for reliable identification of Correct Information Units (CIUs, Nicholas & Brookshire, 1993), during a picture description task. The five supervised ML models were trained using randomly selected human-coded transcripts and accompanying words and CIUs from persons with aphasia. The baseline model training produced a high accuracy across transcripts for word vs non-word, with all models achieving near perfect performance (0.995) with high AUC range (0.914 min, 0.995 max). In contrast, CIU vs non-CIU showed a greater variability, with the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) model the highest accuracy (0.824) and second highest AUC (0.787). These findings indicate that while the supervised ML models can distinguish word from not word, identifying CIUs is challenging.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e94\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u7247\u63cf\u8ff0\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u6b63\u786e\u4fe1\u606f\u5355\u5143\uff08CIU\uff09\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533a\u5206\u8bcd\u6c47/\u975e\u8bcd\u6c47\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8bc6\u522bCIU\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfCIU\u5206\u6790\u4f9d\u8d56\u8a00\u8bed\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u5bb6\u624b\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u6790\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u968f\u673a\u9009\u53d6\u7684\u5931\u8bed\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u4eba\u5de5\u7f16\u7801\u8f6c\u5f55\u672c\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e94\u79cd\u76d1\u7763\u5f0fML\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u542bk\u8fd1\u90bb\u7b97\u6cd5\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8bcd\u6c47/\u975e\u8bcd\u6c47\u3001CIU/\u975eCIU\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u8bcd\u6c47\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe0.995\uff08AUC 0.914-0.995\uff09\uff0cCIU\u8bc6\u522b\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u4e3ak-NN\uff08\u51c6\u786e\u73870.824\uff0cAUC 0.787\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u57fa\u7840\u8bed\u8a00\u5355\u4f4d\uff0c\u4f46CIU\u8bc6\u522b\u9700\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316CIU\u5206\u6790\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u5c40\u9650\u3002"}}

Building on this, we introduce Word-level TTS Alignment by ASR-driven Attentive Reward (W3AR). Without explicit reward annotations, W3AR uses attention from a pre-trained ASR model to drive finer-grained alignment and optimization of sequences predicted by a TTS model.

To mitigate performance degradation, knowledge distillation transfers information from the original model to the pruned student, enabling the smaller model to preserve reasoning ability.

Multi-modal Large Language Models (LLMs) can solve this task and have shown remarkable performance. Recently, it has been noticed that the accuracy of data extraction by multi-modal LLMs can be affected when in-plane rotations are present in the documents. However, real-world document images are usually not only in-plane rotated but also perspectively distorted. This study investigates the impacts of such perturbations on the data extraction accuracy for the state-of-the-art model, Gemini-1.5-pro. Because perspective distortions have a high degree of freedom, designing experiments in the same manner as single-parametric rotations is difficult. We observed typical distortions of document images and showed that most of them approximately follow an isosceles-trapezoidal transformation, which allows us to evaluate distortions with a small number of parameters. We were able to reduce the number of independent parameters from eight to two, i.e. rotation angle and distortion ratio. Then, specific entities were extracted from synthetically generated sample documents with varying these parameters. As the performance of LLMs, we evaluated not only a character-recognition accuracy but also a structure-recognition accuracy. Whereas the former represents the classical indicators for optical character recognition, the latter is related to the correctness of reading order.

Traditional coordination mechanisms, such as centralized oversight or adversarial adjudication, struggle to scale and often obscure how decisions emerge. We introduce a market-making framework for multi-agent large language model (LLM) coordination that organizes agent interactions as structured economic exchanges. In this setup, each agent acts as a market participant, updating and trading probabilistic beliefs, to converge toward shared, truthful outcomes. By aligning local incentives with collective epistemic goals, the framework promotes self-organizing, verifiable reasoning without requiring external enforcement. Empirically, we evaluate this approach across factual reasoning, ethical judgment, and commonsense inference tasks. Market-based coordination yields accuracy gains of up to 10% over single-shot baselines while preserving interpretability and transparency of intermediate reasoning steps. Beyond these improvements, our findings demonstrate that economic coordination principles can operationalize accountability and robustness in multi-agent LLM systems, offering a scalable pathway toward self-correcting, socially responsible AI capable of maintaining trust and oversight in real world deployment scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e02\u573a\u673a\u5236\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53LLM\u534f\u8c03\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4ea4\u6362\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u534710%\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u534f\u8c03\u673a\u5236\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u4e14\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u65b0\u578b\u534f\u8c03\u8303\u5f0f\u4fdd\u969c\u53ef\u4fe1AI\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u5c06LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5e02\u573a\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u7387\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4ea4\u6613\u5f62\u6210\u7ecf\u6d4e\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u4f7f\u5c40\u90e8\u6fc0\u52b1\u4e0e\u96c6\u4f53\u8ba4\u77e5\u76ee\u6807\u81ea\u52a8\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406/\u4f26\u7406\u5224\u65ad\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u76f8\u6bd4\u5355\u6b21\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u534710%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u6761\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ecf\u6d4e\u534f\u8c03\u673a\u5236\u4e3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8d23\u4efb\u6027\u5b9e\u73b0\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4f7fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u5907\u81ea\u6211\u7ea0\u6b63\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u652f\u6491\u793e\u4f1a\u53ef\u4fe1\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

Traditional methods like quantization and pruning struggle to achieve extreme compression of LLMs without sacrificing accuracy. In this paper, we introduce PocketLLM, a novel approach to compress LLMs in a latent space via meta-networks. A simple encoder network is proposed to project the weights of LLMs into discrete latent vectors, which are then represented using a compact codebook. A lightweight decoder network is employed to map the codebook's representative vectors back to the original weight space. This method allows for significant compression of the large weights in LLMs, consisting solely of a small decoder, a concise codebook, and an index.

However, today's language models lack a mechanism for isolating user interactions and concurrent tasks, creating a new attack vector inherent to this new setting: cross-user poisoning (CUP). In a CUP attack, an adversary injects ordinary-looking messages that poison the persistent, shared state, which later triggers the agent to execute unintended, attacker-specified actions on behalf of benign users. We validate CUP on real systems, successfully attacking popular multi-user agents. To study the phenomenon systematically, we present MURMUR, a framework that composes single-user tasks into concurrent, group-based scenarios using an LLM to generate realistic, history-aware user interactions.

We introduce Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL), a modular architecture that explicitly separates agent cognition into five phases: Retrieval, Cognition, Control, Action, and Memory (R-CCAM). At the core of SCL is Soft Symbolic Control, an adaptive governance mechanism that applies symbolic constraints to probabilistic inference, preserving neural flexibility while restoring the explainability and controllability of classical symbolic systems. Through empirical validation on multi-step conditional reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that SCL achieves zero policy violations, eliminates redundant tool calls, and maintains complete decision traceability. These results address critical gaps in existing frameworks such as ReAct, AutoGPT, and memory-augmented approaches. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we situate SCL within the taxonomy of hybrid intelligence, differentiating it from prompt-centric and memory-only approaches; (2) we formally define Soft Symbolic Control and contrast it with neuro-symbolic AI; and (3) we derive three design principles for trustworthy agents: modular decomposition, adaptive symbolic governance, and transparent state management.

As large language models increasingly enable the creation of sophisticated fake news, understanding human detection capabilities becomes crucial, particularly across different cultural contexts. We conducted a survey where 89 participants (56 South Africans, 33 from other nationalities) evaluated 10 true South African news articles and 10 AI-generated fake versions. Results reveal an asymmetric pattern: South Africans demonstrated superior performance in detecting true news about their country (40% deviation from ideal rating) compared to other participants (52%), but performed worse at identifying fake news (62% vs. 55%). This difference may reflect South Africans' higher overall trust in news sources. Our analysis further shows that South Africans relied more on content knowledge and contextual understanding when judging credibility, while participants from other countries emphasised formal linguistic features such as grammar and structure. Overall, the deviation from ideal rating was similar between groups (51% vs. 53%), suggesting that cultural familiarity appears to aid verification of authentic information but may also introduce bias when evaluating fabricated content.

However, existing LLM serving frameworks exhibit non-deterministic behavior: identical inputs can yield different outputs when system configurations (e.g., tensor parallel (TP) size, batch size) vary, even under greedy decoding. This arises from the non-associativity of floating-point arithmetic and inconsistent reduction orders across GPUs. While prior work has addressed batch-size-related nondeterminism through batch-invariant kernels, determinism across different TP sizes remains an open problem, particularly in RL settings, where the training engine typically uses Fully Sharded Data Parallel (i.e., TP = 1) while the rollout engine relies on multi-GPU TP to maximize the inference throughput, creating a natural mismatch between the two. This precision mismatch problem may lead to suboptimal performance or even collapse for RL training. We identify and analyze the root causes of TP-induced inconsistency and propose Tree-Based Invariant Kernels (TBIK), a set of TP-invariant matrix multiplication and reduction primitives that guarantee bit-wise identical results regardless of TP size. Our key insight is to align intra- and inter-GPU reduction orders through a unified hierarchical binary tree structure. We implement these kernels in Triton and integrate them into vLLM and FSDP.

Knowledge distillation (KD) has emerged as a powerful approach for building lightweight but competitive models, with strong evidence from both language and vision domains. However, its application to VLMs, particularly CLIP-style models, remains limited, often constrained to small-scale teachers and narrow evaluation tasks such as classification or retrieval. In this work, we present the first systematic study of distillation across a range of CLIP-style teacher models, ranging from standard baselines to large-scale state-of-the-art models. Contrary to trends observed in NLP and vision, we find that stronger teachers do not consistently yield better students; in fact, existing distillation frameworks often fail to scale, leading to degraded performance in downstream multimodal tasks such as visual question answering.

To address this critical gap, we introduce a novel and comprehensive benchmark, the first of its kind, designed to catalyze progress in automated scientific visualization. It consists of 3,000 research papers paired with their corresponding high-quality ground-truth diagrams and is accompanied by a three-tiered evaluation metric assessing semantic accuracy, layout coherence, and visual quality. Furthermore, to establish a strong baseline on this new benchmark, we propose Paper2SysArch, an end-to-end system that leverages multi-agent collaboration to convert papers into structured, editable diagrams. To validate its performance on complex cases, the system was evaluated on a manually curated and more challenging subset of these papers, where it achieves a composite score of 69.0. This work's principal contribution is the establishment of a large-scale, foundational benchmark to enable reproducible research and fair comparison.

Different from the assessment of text-driven image generation, text-driven image editing is characterized by simultaneously conditioning on both text and a source image. The edited images often retain an intrinsic connection to the original image, which dynamically change with the semantics of the text. However, previous methods tend to solely focus on text-image alignment or have not well aligned with human perception. In this work, we introduce the Text-driven Image Editing Benchmark suite (IE-Bench) to enhance the assessment of text-driven edited images. IE-Bench includes a database contains diverse source images, various editing prompts and the corresponding edited results from different editing methods, and nearly 4,000 samples with corresponding Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) provided by 15 human subjects. Furthermore, we introduce IE-Critic-R1, which, benefiting from Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), provides more comprehensive and explainable quality assessment for text-driven image editing that aligns with human perception.

A central challenge is to compare two LMCs, for example to assess the accuracy of an abstraction or to quantify the effect of model perturbations. In this work, we study the recently introduced Cantor-Kantorovich (or CK) distance. In particular we show that the latter can be framed as a discounted sum of finite-horizon Total Variation distances, making it an instance of discounted linear distance, but arising from the natural Cantor topology. Building on the latter observation, we analyze the properties of the CK distance along three dimensions: computational complexity, continuity properties and approximation. More precisely, we show that the exact computation of the CK distance is #P-hard. We also provide an upper bound on the CK distance as a function of the approximation relation between the two LMCs, and show that a bounded CK distance implies a bounded error between probabilities of finite-horizon traces. Finally, we provide a computable approximation scheme, and show that the latter is also #P-hard. Altogether, our results provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for the CK distance and clarify its relationship with existing distances.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86Cantor-Kantorovich\u8ddd\u79bb\u5728\u6807\u8bb0\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3001\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u53ca\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5176\u4e0e\u6298\u6263\u603b\u53d8\u5dee\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176#P-hard\u6027\u53ca\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LMCs\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff08\u5982\u8bc4\u4f30\u62bd\u8c61\u5316\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6216\u6270\u52a8\u5f71\u54cd\uff09\uff0c\u9700\u5bf9CK\u8ddd\u79bb\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4ee5\u660e\u786e\u5176\u9002\u7528\u8fb9\u754c\u53ca\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "1. \u5c06CK\u8ddd\u79bb\u6846\u67b6\u5316\u4e3aCantor\u62d3\u6251\u4e0b\u7684\u6298\u6263\u7ebf\u6027\u8ddd\u79bb\n2. \u4ece\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff08#P-hard\u8bc1\u660e\uff09\u3001\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff08\u6709\u9650\u8f68\u8ff9\u6982\u7387\u8bef\u5dee\u8fb9\u754c\uff09\u53ca\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6027\uff08\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6848\uff09\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5c55\u5f00\u5206\u6790", "result": "1. \u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u7b97CK\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e3a#P-hard\n2. \u5efa\u7acb\u6709\u9650\u8f68\u8ff9\u6982\u7387\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u8fb9\u754c\n3. \u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6848\uff08\u540c\u6837\u5177\u6709#P-hard\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff09", "conclusion": "CK\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136Cantor\u62d3\u6251\u7684\u4ea7\u7269\uff0c\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u5c5e\u6027\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u8f83\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7#P-hard\u7ed3\u679c\u6f84\u6e05\u4e86\u5176\u4e0e\u7ebf\u6027\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u8fb9\u754c\u3002"}}
