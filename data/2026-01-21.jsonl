While recent advances in generative AI have sought to automate this process, existing methods produce non-editable representation, such as meshes or point clouds, limiting their adaptability for iterative design. In this paper, we introduce Proc3D, a system designed to generate editable 3D models while enabling real-time modifications. At its core, Proc3D introduces procedural compact graph (PCG), a graph representation of 3D models, that encodes the algorithmic rules and structures necessary for generating the model. This representation exposes key parameters, allowing intuitive manual adjustments via sliders and checkboxes, as well as real-time, automated modifications through natural language prompts using Large Language Models (LLMs). We demonstrate Proc3D's capabilities using two generative approaches: GPT-4o with in-context learning (ICL) and a fine-tuned LLAMA-3 model. Experimental results show that Proc3D outperforms existing methods in editing efficiency, achieving more than 400x speedup over conventional approaches that require full regeneration for each modification. Additionally, Proc3D improves ULIP scores by 28%, a metric that evaluates the alignment between generated 3D models and text prompts. By enabling text-aligned 3D model generation along with precise, real-time parametric edits, Proc3D facilitates highly accurate text-based image editing applications."}

Earlier approaches primarily rely on geometric alignment procedures, while recent work leverages pretrained 2D diffusion models to model language-conditioned object-object spatial relationships. In contrast, we directly optimize the relative pose at test time, updating translation, rotation, and isotropic scale with CLIP-driven gradients via a differentiable renderer, without training a new model. Our framework augments language supervision with geometry-aware objectives: a variant of soft-Iterative Closest Point (ICP) term to encourage surface attachment and a penetration loss to discourage interpenetration. A phased schedule strengthens contact constraints over time, and camera control concentrates the optimization on the interaction region. To enable evaluation, we curate a benchmark containing diverse categories and relations, and compare against baselines. Our method outperforms all alternatives, yielding semantically faithful and physically plausible alignments."}

In certain circumstances, however, obtaining a suitable line of sight may be impractical, dangerous, or even impossible. Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging addresses this challenge by reconstructing the scene from indirect measurements. Recently, passive NLOS methods that use an ordinary photograph of the subtle shadow cast onto a visible wall by the hidden scene have gained interest. These methods are currently limited to 1D or low-resolution 2D color imaging or to localizing a hidden object whose shape is approximately known. Here, we generalize this class of methods and demonstrate a 3D reconstruction of a hidden scene from an ordinary NLOS photograph. To achieve this, we propose a novel reformulation of the light transport model that conveniently decomposes the hidden scene into \\textit{light-occluding} and \\textit{non-light-occluding} components to yield a separable non-linear least squares (SNLLS) inverse problem. We develop two solutions: A gradient-based optimization method and a physics-inspired neural network approach, which we call Soft Shadow diffusion (SSD). Despite the challenging ill-conditioned inverse problem encountered here, our approaches are effective on numerous 3D scenes in real experimental scenarios. Moreover, SSD is trained in simulation but generalizes well to unseen classes in simulation and real-world NLOS scenes. SSD also shows surprising robustness to noise and ambient illumination."}

In contrast to human hairstyle reconstruction, there are also no datasets that can be leveraged to learn a fur prior for different animals. In this work, we present a first multi-view-based method for high-fidelity 3D fur modeling of animals using a strand-based representation, leveraging the general knowledge of a vision language model. Given multi-view RGB images, we first reconstruct a coarse surface geometry using traditional multi-view stereo techniques. We then use a vision language model (VLM) system to retrieve information about the realistic length structure of the fur for each part of the body. We use this knowledge to construct the animal's furless geometry and grow strands atop it. The fur reconstruction is supervised with both geometric and photometric losses computed from multi-view images. To mitigate orientation ambiguities stemming from the Gabor filters that are applied to the input images, we additionally utilize the VLM to guide the strands' growth direction and their relation to the gravity vector that we incorporate as a loss. With this new schema of using a VLM to guide 3D reconstruction from multi-view inputs, we show generalization across a variety of animals with different fur types.

In this work, we present Compass-Embedding v4, a high-efficiency multilingual embedding framework specifically optimized for Southeast Asian (SEA) e-commerce scenarios, where data scarcity, noisy supervision, and strict production constraints jointly challenge representation learning. Compass-Embedding v4 addresses three core challenges. First, large-batch contrastive training under mixed task supervision introduces systematic false negatives that degrade semantic alignment. We propose Class-Aware Masking (CAM), a lightweight modification to the InfoNCE objective that suppresses invalid in-batch negatives and improves semantic discrimination without altering training efficiency. Second, low-resource SEA languages suffer from limited and uneven data coverage. We construct a diversified training corpus through context-grounded synthetic data generation, cross-lingual translation, and structured e-commerce data construction, enabling robust multilingual and domain-specific learning. Third, production deployment requires high-throughput inference while preserving embedding quality. We combine robustness-driven large-batch training with spherical model merging to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, and optimize inference via vLLM and FP8 quantization. Extensive evaluations across multilingual benchmarks and proprietary e-commerce tasks show that Compass-Embedding v4 achieves state-of-the-art performance on major SEA languages, significantly outperforming general-purpose embedding models in domain-specific retrieval and classification, while maintaining competitive performance on high-resource languages."}

Classic techniques offer precise and rapid deformation control. However, they solve an optimization problem with constraints defined by control handle placement, requiring a user to know apriori the ideal distribution of handles on the shape to accomplish the desired edit. The mapping from handle set to deformation behavior is often unintuitive and, importantly, non-semantic. Modern data-driven methods, on the other hand, leverage a data prior to obtain semantic edits, but are slow and imprecise. We propose a technique that fuses the semantic prior of data with the precise control and speed of traditional frameworks. Our approach is surprisingly simple yet effective: deep feature proximity makes for smooth and semantic deformation weights, with no need for additional regularization. The weights can be computed in real-time for any surface point, whereas prior methods require optimization for new handles. Moreover, the semantic prior from deep features enables co-deformation of semantic parts. We introduce an improved feature distillation pipeline, barycentric feature distillation, which efficiently uses the visual signal from shape renders to minimize distillation cost. This allows our weights to be computed for high resolution meshes in under a minute, in contrast to potentially hours for both classical and neural methods. We preserve and extend properties of classical methods through feature space constraints and locality weighting. Our field representation allows for automatic detection of semantic symmetries, which we use to produce symmetry-preserving deformations. We show a proof-of-concept application which can produce deformations for meshes up to 1 million faces in real-time on a consumer-grade machine."}

In stochastic settings, we evaluate output variability and investigate the relationship between consistency and correctness. HuatuoGPT-o1-8B achieved the highest performance. The results show that high consistency across the model response is not an indicator of correctness, although HuatuoGPT-o1-8B showed the highest consistency rate. When tasked with selecting correct reasoning, both HuatuoGPT-o1-8B and Diabetica-o1 exhibit self-assessment bias and dependency on the order of the candidate explanations. Expert review of incorrect reasoning rationales identified a mix of clinically acceptable responses and clinical oversight. We further show that system-level perturbations, such as differences in CUDA builds, can yield statistically significant shifts in model output despite stable accuracy. This work demonstrates that small, semantically negligible prompt perturbations lead to divergent outputs, raising concerns about reproducibility of LLM-based evaluations and highlights the output variability under different stochastic regimes, emphasizing the need of a broader diagnostic framework to understand potential pitfalls in real-world clinical decision support scenarios."}

The 3D model enables inspectors and customers to rotate, zoom, and slice through the undercarriage, allowing them to detect rust, leaks, or impact damage in seconds, thereby improving both workplace safety and buyer confidence. Our primary contribution is a rig-aware Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipeline specifically designed to overcome the challenges of wide-angle lens distortion and low-parallax scenes. Our method overcomes the challenges of wide-angle lens distortion and low-parallax scenes by integrating precise camera calibration, synchronized video streams, and strong geometric priors from the camera rig.

This problem is made worse because many authors disclose only partial or trivial limitations. We propose LimAgents, a multi-agent LLM framework for generating substantive limitations. LimAgents integrates OpenReview comments and author-stated limitations to provide stronger ground truth. It also uses cited and citing papers to capture broader contextual weaknesses. In this setup, different agents have specific roles as sequential role: some extract explicit limitations, others analyze methodological gaps, some simulate the viewpoint of a peer reviewer, and a citation agent places the work within the larger body of literature. A Judge agent refines their outputs, and a Master agent consolidates them into a clear set. This structure allows for systematic identification of explicit, implicit, peer review-focused, and literature-informed limitations. Moreover, traditional NLP metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and cosine similarity rely heavily on n-gram or embedding overlap. They often overlook semantically similar limitations. To address this, we introduce a pointwise evaluation protocol that uses an LLM-as-a-Judge to measure coverage more accurately. Experiments show that LimAgents substantially improve performance.

These heuristic perturbations frequently generate semantically invalid, out-of-distribution inputs that weaken the fidelity of local surrogate models. While recent generative approaches such as LLiMe (Angiulli et al., 2025b) attempt to mitigate this by employing Large Language Models for neighborhood generation, they rely on unconstrained paraphrasing that introduces confounding variables, making it difficult to isolate specific feature contributions. We introduce LIME-LLM, a framework that replaces random noise with hypothesis-driven, controlled perturbations. By enforcing a strict \"Single Mask-Single Sample\" protocol and employing distinct neutral infill and boundary infill strategies, LIME-LLM constructs fluent, on-manifold neighborhoods that rigorously isolate feature effects. We evaluate our method against established baselines (LIME, SHAP, Integrated Gradients) and the generative LLiMe baseline across three diverse benchmarks: CoLA, SST-2, and HateXplain using human-annotated rationales as ground truth. Empirical results demonstrate that LIME-LLM establishes a new benchmark for black-box NLP explainability, achieving significant improvements in local explanation fidelity compared to both traditional perturbation-based methods and recent generative alternatives."}

Using a substantial dataset of Reddit posts, we trained a logistic regression classifier on carefully curated subreddits for training, validation, and test splits. Comprehensive evaluation included feature ablation, keyword masking experiments, and varying-density difference analyses comparing anxious and control groups, along with external validation using clinically interviewed participants with diagnosed anxiety disorders. The model achieved strong performance while maintaining high accuracy even after sentiment removal or keyword masking. Early detection using minimal post history significantly outperformed random classification, and cross-domain analysis demonstrated strong consistency with clinical interview data. Results indicate that transparent linguistic features can support reliable, generalizable, and keyword-robust anxiety detection.

However, current detoxification techniques rarely exploit these built-in abilities; instead, they rely on external modules, labor-intensive data annotation, or human intervention --factors that hinder scalability and consistency. In this paper, we introduce a fully self-reflective detoxification framework that harnesses the inherent capacities of LLMs to detect, correct toxic content, and refine LLMs without external modules and data annotation. Specifically, we propose a Toxic Signal Detector --an internal self-identification mechanism, coupled with a systematic intervention process to transform toxic text into its non-toxic counterpart. This iterative procedure yields a contrastive detoxification dataset used to fine-tune the model, enhancing its ability for safe and coherent text generation. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as DetoxLLM and ParaDetox show that our method achieves better detoxification performance than state-of-the-art methods while preserving semantic fidelity. By obviating the need for human intervention or external components, this paper reveals the intrinsic self-detoxification ability of LLMs, offering a consistent and effective approach for mitigating harmful content generation. Ultimately, our findings underscore the potential for truly self-regulated language models, paving the way for more responsible and ethically guided text generation systems."}

We evaluate the validity of a simpler alternative: can translation quality alone indicate a model's broader multilingual capabilities? Through systematic evaluation of 14 models (1B-72B parameters) across 9 diverse benchmarks and 7 translation metrics, we find that translation performance is a good indicator of downstream task success (e.g., Phi-4, median Pearson r: MetricX = 0.89, xCOMET = 0.91, SSA-COMET = 0.87). These results suggest that the representational abilities supporting faithful translation overlap with those required for multilingual understanding.

However, NTP operates at the \\textit{token} level, treating deviations from a single reference continuation as errors even when alternative continuations are equally plausible or semantically equivalent (e.g., ``mom'' vs. ``mother''). As a result, token-level loss can penalize valid abstractions, paraphrases, or conceptually correct reasoning paths, biasing models toward surface form rather than underlying meaning. This mismatch between the training signal and semantic correctness motivates learning objectives that operate over higher-level representations. We propose a shift from token-level to concept-level prediction, where concepts group multiple surface forms of the same idea (e.g., ``mom,'' ``mommy,'' ``mother'' $\\rightarrow$ \\textit{MOTHER}). We introduce various methods for integrating conceptual supervision into LLM training and show that concept-aware models achieve lower perplexity, improved robustness under domain shift, and stronger performance than NTP-based models on diverse NLP benchmarks. This suggests \\textit{concept-level supervision} as an improved training signal that better aligns LLMs with human semantic abstractions."}

To address this gap, we propose Cross-Tokenizer Preference Distillation (CTPD), the first unified framework for transferring human-aligned behavior between models with heterogeneous tokenizers. CTPD introduces three key innovations: (1) Aligned Span Projection, which maps teacher and student tokens to shared character-level spans for precise supervision transfer; (2) a cross-tokenizer adaptation of Token-level Importance Sampling (TIS-DPO) for improved credit assignment; and (3) a Teacher-Anchored Reference, allowing the student to directly leverage the teacher's preferences in a DPO-style objective. Our theoretical analysis grounds CTPD in importance sampling, and experiments across multiple benchmarks confirm its effectiveness, with significant performance gains over existing methods. These results establish CTPD as a practical and general solution for preference distillation across diverse tokenization schemes, opening the door to more accessible and efficient alignment of language models."}

We found that strong reasoning models avoided Einstellung-based traps more often than weaker reasoning models, achieving human-level performance on mARC.

Yet most existing models learn topics in disjoint, language-specific spaces and rely on alignment mechanisms (e.g., bilingual dictionaries) that often fail to capture deep cross-lingual semantics, resulting in loosely connected topic spaces. Moreover, these approaches often overlook the rich semantic signals embedded in multilingual pretrained representations, further limiting their ability to capture fine-grained alignment. We introduce GloCTM (Global Context Space for Cross-Lingual Topic Model), a novel framework that enforces cross-lingual topic alignment through a unified semantic space spanning the entire model pipeline. GloCTM constructs enriched input representations by expanding bag-of-words with cross-lingual lexical neighborhoods, and infers topic proportions using both local and global encoders, with their latent representations aligned through internal regularization. At the output level, the global topic-word distribution, defined over the combined vocabulary, structurally synchronizes topic meanings across languages. To further ground topics in deep semantic space, GloCTM incorporates a Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) loss that aligns the latent topic space with multilingual contextual embeddings. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that GloCTM significantly improves topic coherence and cross-lingual alignment, outperforming strong baselines."}

But what happens if the context does not align with model priors or safety protocols? In this paper, we investigate how LLMs behave and reason when presented with counterfactual or even adversarial medical evidence. We first construct MedCounterFact, a counterfactual medical QA dataset that requires the models to answer clinical comparison questions (i.e., judge the efficacy of certain treatments, with evidence consisting of randomized controlled trials provided as context). In MedCounterFact, real-world medical interventions within the questions and evidence are systematically replaced with four types of counterfactual stimuli, ranging from unknown words to toxic substances. Our evaluation across multiple frontier LLMs on MedCounterFact reveals that in the presence of counterfactual evidence, existing models overwhelmingly accept such \"evidence\" at face value even when it is dangerous or implausible, and provide confident and uncaveated answers. While it may be prudent to draw a boundary between faithfulness and safety, our findings reveal that there exists no such boundary yet."}

To address this limitation, we propose PPA-Plan, a proactive planning strategy for long-context reasoning that focuses on preventing such failures before plan generation. PPA-Plan identifies potential logical pitfalls and false assumptions, formulates them as negative constraints, and conditions plan generation on explicitly avoiding these constraints. Experiments on long-context QA benchmarks show that executing plans generated by PPA-Plan consistently outperforms existing plan-and-execute methods and direct prompting."}

Existing single-LLM-based methods primarily reduce the context window or optimize the attention mechanism, but they often encounter additional computational costs or constrained expanded context length. While multi-agent-based frameworks can mitigate these limitations, they remain susceptible to the accumulation of errors and the propagation of hallucinations. In this work, we draw inspiration from the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to design a Multi-Agent System called LSTM-MAS, emulating LSTM's hierarchical information flow and gated memory mechanisms for long-context understanding. Specifically, LSTM-MAS organizes agents in a chained architecture, where each node comprises a worker agent for segment-level comprehension, a filter agent for redundancy reduction, a judge agent for continuous error detection, and a manager agent for globally regulates information propagation and retention, analogous to LSTM and its input gate, forget gate, constant error carousel unit, and output gate. These novel designs enable controlled information transfer and selective long-term dependency modeling across textual segments, which can effectively avoid error accumulation and hallucination propagation. We conducted an extensive evaluation of our method.

While LLMs are already achieving near-human accuracy on objective annotation tasks, their performance on subjective annotation tasks, such as those involving psychological constructs, is less consistent and more prone to errors. Standard evaluation practices typically collapse all annotation errors into a single alignment metric, but this simplified approach may obscure different kinds of errors that affect final analytical conclusions in different ways. Here, we propose a diagnostic evaluation paradigm that incorporates a human-in-the-loop step to separate task-inherent ambiguity from model-driven inaccuracies and assess annotation quality in terms of their potential downstream impacts. We refine this paradigm on ordinal annotation tasks, which are common in subjective annotation. The refined paradigm includes: (1) a diagnostic taxonomy that categorizes LLM annotation errors along two dimensions: source (model-specific vs. task-inherent) and type (boundary ambiguity vs. conceptual misidentification); (2) a lightweight human annotation test to estimate task-inherent ambiguity from LLM annotations; and (3) a computational method to decompose observed LLM annotation errors following our taxonomy. We validate this paradigm on four educational annotation tasks, demonstrating both its conceptual validity and practical utility. Theoretically, our work provides empirical evidence for why excessively high alignment is unrealistic in specific annotation tasks and why single alignment metrics inadequately reflect the quality of LLM annotations. In practice, our paradigm can be a low-cost diagnostic tool that assesses the suitability of a given task for LLM annotation and provides actionable insights for further technical optimization."}

Instead, we focus on Macro-F1 as a more representative measure of a model's ability across the long-tail of event types.

DoublyCal employs a lightweight proxy model to first generate KG evidence alongside a calibrated evidence confidence.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue for addressing this issue, their effectiveness is often hindered by Sycophancy, a tendency to produce reasoning that matches users' beliefs over truthful ones, which deviates from instruction-following principles. Rather than treating sycophancy as a flaw to be eliminated, this work proposes a novel approach that initially harnesses this behavior to generate contrastive reasoning from opposing perspectives. Specifically, we design a Self-renewal Opposing-stance Reasoning Generation (SORG) framework that prompts LLMs to produce high-quality agree and disagree reasoning pairs for a given news title without requiring ground-truth labels. To utilize the generated reasoning, we develop a local Opposing Reasoning-based Clickbait Detection (ORCD) model that integrates three BERT encoders to represent the title and its associated reasoning. The model leverages contrastive learning, guided by soft labels derived from LLM-generated credibility scores, to enhance detection robustness. Experimental evaluations on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms LLM prompting, fine-tuned smaller language models, and state-of-the-art clickbait detection baselines."}

In this work, we conduct a systematic study of how static and dynamic quantization methods impact fairness and safety across benchmarks measuring intrinsic and extrinsic bias and safety alignment. For fairness, we evaluate English, French, Dutch, Spanish, and Turkish; for safety, we focus on English, Korean, and Arabic. Our findings reveal that quantization consistently degrades fairness and safety, with dynamic methods demonstrating greater stability than static ones. Moreover, fairness degradation varies across languages, while safety deterioration is especially pronounced in non-English settings. To address these risks, we introduce Critical Weight Protection, a novel technique that identifies and preserves fairness- and safety-critical weights during quantization. This approach effectively mitigates bias and safety deterioration without costly retraining or alignment, maintaining trustworthiness while retaining efficiency."}

We propose codebook-injected segmentation, which conditions boundary decisions on downstream annotation criteria, and evaluate LLM-based segmenters against standard and retrieval-augmented baselines. To assess these without gold labels, we introduce evaluation metrics for span consistency, distinctiveness, and human-AI distributional agreement. We found DA-awareness produces segments that are internally more consistent than text-only baselines. While LLMs excel at creating construct-consistent spans, coherence-based baselines remain superior at detecting global shifts in dialogue flow. Across two datasets, no single segmenter dominates. Improvements in within-segment coherence frequently trade off against boundary distinctiveness and human-AI distributional agreement. These results highlight segmentation as a consequential design choice that should be optimized for downstream objectives rather than a single performance score."}

This work presents a mechanistic study of that choice by extracting an \\emph{arbitration vector} from model activations on a curated dataset designed to disentangle (i) irrelevant contexts that elicit parametric recall and (ii) relevant but false contexts that elicit copying. The vector is computed as the residual-stream centroid difference between these regimes across 27 relations, and is injected as an additive intervention at selected layers and token spans to steer behavior in two directions: Copy$\\rightarrow$Recall (suppressing context use) and Recall$\\rightarrow$Copy (inducing the model to copy any token from the context). Experiments on two architectures (decoder-only and encoder/decoder) and two open-domain QA benchmarks show consistent behavior shifts under moderate scaling while monitoring accuracy and fluency. Mechanistic analyses of attention routing, MLP contributions, and layer-wise probability trajectories reveal an asymmetry: inducing copying is an easy ``reactivation'' process that can be triggered at different locations in the input, while restoring recall is a ``suppression'' process that is more fragile and strongly tied to object-token interventions."}

To bridge this gap, we propose PURPLE, a contextual bandit framework that oPtimizes UseR Profiles for Llm pErsonalization. In contrast to a greedy selection of the most relevant records, PURPLE treats profile construction as a set generation process and utilizes a Plackett-Luce ranking model to capture complex inter-record dependencies. By training with dense feedback provided by the likelihood of the reference response, our method aligns retrieval directly with generation quality.

Longer texts, features requiring ordinal distinctions, and ambiguous constructs proved particularly difficult.

We present EZ-MIA, a membership inference attack that exploits a key observation: memorization manifests most strongly at error positions, specifically tokens where the model predicts incorrectly yet still shows elevated probability for training examples. We introduce the Error Zone (EZ) score, which measures the directional imbalance of probability shifts at error positions relative to a pretrained reference model. This principled statistic requires only two forward passes per query and no model training of any kind. On WikiText with GPT-2, EZ-MIA achieves 3.8x higher detection than the previous state-of-the-art under identical conditions (66.3% versus 17.5% true positive rate at 1% false positive rate), with near-perfect discrimination (AUC 0.98). At the stringent 0.1% FPR threshold critical for real-world auditing, we achieve 8x higher detection than prior work (14.0% versus 1.8%), requiring no reference model training. These gains extend to larger architectures: on AG News with Llama-2-7B, we achieve 3x higher detection (46.7% versus 15.8% TPR at 1% FPR).

LLMs (GPT4) are then used for the next step topic labeling. Their outputs for a single interview (I0) are rated through a small-scale human evaluation, focusing on {coherence}, {clarity}, and {relevance}. Based on the preliminary results and evaluation, BERTopic shows stronger performance and is selected for further experimentation using three {clinically oriented embedding} models.

Results show that domain-specific embeddings improved topic \\textit{precision} and \\textit{interpretability}, with BioClinicalBERT producing the most consistent results across transcripts. The global analysis of the full dataset of 13 interviews, using the BioClinicalBERT embedding model, reveals the most dominant topics throughout all 13 interviews, namely ``Coordination and Communication in Cancer Care Management\" and ``Patient Decision-Making in Cancer Treatment Journey''. Although the interviews are machine translations from Dutch to English, and clinical professionals are not involved in this evaluation, the findings suggest that neural topic modeling, particularly BERTopic, can help provide useful feedback to clinicians from patient interviews.

For training, the repetition of dialect tags in transcriptions is estimated either using a proposed Language-Agnostic Heuristic (LAH) approach or a pre-trained ASR model. The method is evaluated on the low-resource Arabic Dialect Identification (ADI) task, with experimental results demonstrating that an SSL-based CTC-DID model, trained on a limited dataset, outperforms both fine-tuned Whisper and ECAPA-TDNN models.

To address this, we introduce CoReflect (Conversational Evaluation via Co-Evolutionary Simulation and Reflective Rubric Refinement), which unifies dialogue simulation and evaluation into an adaptive, iterative process. CoReflect employs a conversation planner that generates structured templates to guide a user simulator through diverse, goal-directed dialogues. Subsequently, a reflective analyzer processes these dialogues to identify systematic behavioral patterns and automatically refine the evaluation rubrics. Crucially, the insights from the conversation analysis are fed back into the planner to update conversation templates for subsequent iterations. This co-evolution loop ensures that the complexity of test cases and the diagnostic precision of rubrics improve in tandem. By minimizing human intervention, CoReflect provides a scalable and self-refining methodology that allows evaluation protocols to adapt alongside the rapidly advancing capabilities of dialogue models."}

We present Multimodal Generative Engine Optimization (MGEO), a novel adversarial framework that enables a malicious actor to unfairly promote a target product by jointly optimizing imperceptible image perturbations and fluent textual suffixes. Unlike existing attacks that treat modalities in isolation, MGEO employs an alternating gradient-based optimization strategy to exploit the deep cross-modal coupling within the VLM. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets using state-of-the-art models demonstrate that our coordinated attack significantly outperforms text-only and image-only baselines.

While post-training methods can improve ToM performance, we show that strong ToM capability can be recovered directly from the base model without any additional weight updates or verifications. Our approach builds on recent power-sampling methods (Karan & Du, 2025) that use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to sample from sharpened sequence-level (rather than token-level) probability distributions of autoregressive language models.

Current WM methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) are predominantly tailored for autoregressive (AR) models: They rely on tokens being generated sequentially, and embed stable signals within the generated sequence based on the previously sampled text. Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) generate text via non-sequential iterative denoising, which requires significant modification to use WM methods designed for AR models. Recent work proposed to watermark DLMs by inverting the process when needed, but suffers significant computational or memory overhead. We introduce Left-Right Diffusion Watermarking (LR-DWM), a scheme that biases the generated token based on both left and right neighbors, when they are available. LR-DWM incurs minimal runtime and memory overhead, remaining close to the non-watermarked baseline DLM while enabling reliable statistical detection under standard evaluation settings. Our results demonstrate that DLMs can be watermarked efficiently, achieving high detectability with negligible computational and memory overhead."}

Tasks like multilingual transliteration, code refactoring, grammatical correction or text normalization often rely on local dependencies where the full modeling capacity of AR models can be overkill, creating a trade-off between their high accuracy and high inference latency. While non-autoregressive (NAR) models offer speed, they typically suffer from hallucinations and poor length control. To explore this trade-off, we focus on the multilingual transliteration task in Indic languages and introduce NADIR, a novel NAR architecture designed to strike a balance between speed and accuracy. NADIR integrates a Differential Transformer and a Mixture-of-Experts mechanism, enabling it to robustly model complex character mappings without sequential dependencies. NADIR achieves over a 13x speed-up compared to the state-of-the-art AR baseline. It maintains a competitive mean Character Error Rate of 15.78%, compared to 14.44% for the AR model and 21.88% for a standard NAR equivalent. Importantly, NADIR reduces Repetition errors by 49.53%, Substitution errors by 24.45%, Omission errors by 32.92%, and Insertion errors by 16.87%. This work provides a practical blueprint for building fast and reliable NAR systems, effectively bridging the gap between AR accuracy and the demands of real-time, large-scale deployment."}

Among these, we employ two rationale extraction methods, which justify outcomes with human-interpretable and concise text fragments (i.e., rationales) from the given input text. We conduct comparison by evaluating faithfulness-via normalized sufficiency and comprehensiveness metrics along with plausibility-by asking legal experts to evaluate extracted rationales. We further assess the feasibility of LLM-as-a-Judge using legal expert evaluation results.

However, existing mitigation strategies tend towards an image-centric interpretation of these imbalances, often prioritising increased image attention while giving less consideration to the roles of the other modalities. In this study, we evaluate a more holistic, system-mediated account, which attributes these imbalances to functionally redundant system weights that reduce attention to image and textual inputs. We show that this framework offers a useful empirical perspective on the yes-bias, a common form of hallucination in which VLMs indiscriminately respond 'yes'. Causally redistributing attention from the system modality to image and textual inputs substantially suppresses this bias, often outperforming existing approaches. We further present evidence suggesting that system-mediated attention imbalances contribute to the yes-bias by encouraging a default reliance on coarse input representations, which are effective for some tasks but ill-suited to others. Taken together, these findings firmly establish system attention as a key factor in VLM hallucination and highlight its potential as a lever for mitigation."}

We identify the \"almost-there\" phenomenon in long-context reasoning, where trajectories are largely correct but fail at the final step, and attribute this failure to two factors: (1) the lack of high reasoning density in long-context QA data that push LLMs beyond mere grounding toward sophisticated multi-hop reasoning; and (2) the loss of valuable learning signals during long-context RL training due to the indiscriminate penalization of partially correct trajectories with incorrect outcomes. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose DeepReasonQA, a KG-driven synthesis framework that controllably constructs high-difficulty, multi-hop long-context QA pairs with inherent reasoning chains. Building on this, we introduce Long-context Process Advantage Shaping (LongPAS), a simple yet effective method that performs fine-grained credit assignment by evaluating reasoning steps along Validity and Relevance dimensions, which captures critical learning signals from \"almost-there\" trajectories. Experiments on three long-context reasoning benchmarks show that our approach substantially outperforms RLVR baselines and matches frontier LLMs while using far fewer parameters.

Our methodology provides a relative measure of model performance: when required to generate exactly five meanings, both strong and weak models may resort to meanings from dominant languages, but semantically stronger models do so later in the generation sequence, producing more true meanings from the target language before failing, while weaker models resort to dominant-language meanings earlier in the sequence.

However, existing factual recall evaluations primarily assess fact retrieval in isolation, where the queried entity is explicitly named and the fact is requested directly. In natural language use, facts are often accessed through context, where the relevant entity is introduced only indirectly. In this work, we study contextually mediated factual recall, asking whether LLMs can reliably retrieve factual knowledge when the target entity is embedded in a naturalistic context rather than queried explicitly, across languages. We construct controlled prompts that preserve the underlying fact while introducing referential mediation through contextual sentences. To disentangle contextual effects from name-specific associations, we further compare performance using synthetic names and real names across languages. Evaluating multiple model families in five languages, we find that contextual mediation consistently degrades factual recall, with substantial variation across relations. Larger models are more robust to contextual mediation, exhibiting a reduced performance gap relative to direct queries, while the effect of real names and name origin is mixed and unsystematic. These findings highlight a gap between isolated factual recall and context-dependent language understanding in multilingual LLMs."}

However, coming up with a workflow that can balance the models, cloud providers, and external resources is very challenging, making implementing an agentic system more of a hindrance than a help. In this work, we present a domain-agnostic, model-independent workflow for an agentic framework that can act as a scientific assistant while being run entirely on cloud. Built with a supervisor agent marshaling an array of agents with individual capabilities, our framework brings together straightforward tasks like literature review and data analysis with more complex ones like simulation runs.

We report the cost to operate and use this framework, including the breakdown of the cost by services use. We also evaluate our system on a custom-curated synthetic benchmark and a popular Chemistry benchmark, and also perform expert validation of the system. The results show that our system is able to route the task to the correct agent 90% of the time and successfully complete the assigned task 97.5% of the time for the synthetic tasks and 91% of the time for real-world tasks, while still achieving better or comparable accuracy to most frontier models, showing that this is a viable framework for other scientific domains to replicate."}

With the rise of generative AI, fully automated and human-AI workflows have emerged as promising methods for analysis. However, methodological standards to guide such workflows remain limited. In this study, we propose that reasoning traces generated by large language model (LLM) agents, especially within multi-agent systems, constitute a novel and rich form of process data to enhance interpretive practices in qualitative coding. We apply cosine similarity to LLM reasoning traces to systematically detect, quantify, and interpret disagreements among agents, reframing disagreement as a meaningful analytic signal. Analyzing nearly 10,000 instances of agent pairs coding human tutoring dialog segments, we show that LLM agents' semantic reasoning similarity robustly differentiates consensus from disagreement and correlates with human coding reliability. Qualitative analysis guided by this metric reveals nuanced instructional sub-functions within codes and opportunities for conceptual codebook refinement. By integrating quantitative similarity metrics with qualitative review, our method has the potential to improve and accelerate establishing inter-rater reliability during coding by surfacing interpretive ambiguity, especially when LLMs collaborate with humans. We discuss how reasoning-trace disagreements represent a valuable new class of analytic signals advancing methodological rigor and interpretive depth in educational research."}

They also carry increasing risk of data leakage due to overlap with model pretraining corpora and often overlook critical dimensions such as robustness to linguistic variation and potential demographic biases.\n  Materials and Methods: To address these gaps, we introduce BioPulse-QA, a benchmark that evaluates LLMs on answering questions from newly published biomedical documents including drug labels, trial protocols, and clinical guidelines. BioPulse-QA includes 2,280 expert-verified question answering (QA) pairs and perturbed variants, covering both extractive and abstractive formats.

Across closed-form reasoning and open-ended generation tasks, we find that objective choice induces systematic, scale-dependent shifts along the safety-capability frontier.

At larger budgets, objectives diverge sharply: supervised and preference-based tuning tightly couple capability gains to increased adversarial vulnerability and persona drift, while objectives that constrain learning signals -- especially ORPO and KL-regularization -- substantially mitigate both.

Moreover, most guardian models rely on rigid, predefined safety categories that fail to generalize across diverse linguistic and sociocultural contexts. Robust safety, therefore, requires flexible, runtime-enforceable policies and benchmarks that reflect local norms, harm scenarios, and cultural expectations. We introduce UbuntuGuard, the first African policy-based safety benchmark built from adversarial queries authored by 155 domain experts across sensitive fields, including healthcare. From these expert-crafted queries, we derive context-specific safety policies and reference responses that capture culturally grounded risk signals, enabling policy-aligned evaluation of guardian models. We evaluate 13 models, comprising six general-purpose LLMs and seven guardian models across three distinct variants: static, dynamic, and multilingual. Our findings reveal that existing English-centric benchmarks overestimate real-world multilingual safety, cross-lingual transfer provides partial but insufficient coverage, and dynamic models, while better equipped to leverage policies at inference time, still struggle to fully localize African-language contexts.

Although compiler optimizations and hand-written kernels can partially alleviate this issue, achieving near-hardware-limit performance still relies heavily on manual code refactoring and parameter tuning. Recent progress in LLM-agent-based kernel generation and optimization has been reported, yet many approaches primarily focus on direct code rewriting, where parameter choices are often implicit and hard to control, or require human intervention, leading to unstable performance gains. This paper introduces a template-based rewriting layer on top of an agent-driven iterative loop: kernels are semantically refactored into explicitly parameterizable templates, and template parameters are then optimized via search-based autotuning, yielding more stable and higher-quality speedups. Experiments on a set of real-world kernels demonstrate speedups exceeding 3x in the best case. We extract representative CUDA kernels from SGLang as evaluation targets; the proposed agentic tuner iteratively performs templating, testing, analysis, and planning, and leverages profiling feedback to execute constrained parameter search under hardware resource limits. Compared to agent-only direct rewriting, the template-plus-search design significantly reduces the randomness of iterative optimization, making the process more interpretable and enabling a more systematic approach toward high-performance configurations. The proposed method can be further extended to OpenCL, HIP, and other backends to deliver automated performance optimization for real production workloads."}

In this work, we study the multilingual geometry of problem-difficulty in LLMs by training linear probes using the AMC subset of the Easy2Hard benchmark, translated into 21 languages. We found that difficulty-related signals emerge at two distinct stages of the model internals, corresponding to shallow (early-layers) and deep (later-layers) internal representations, that exhibit functionally different behaviors. Probes trained on deep representations achieve high accuracy when evaluated on the same language but exhibit poor cross-lingual generalization. In contrast, probes trained on shallow representations generalize substantially better across languages, despite achieving lower within-language performance. Together, these results suggest that LLMs first form a language-agnostic representation of problem difficulty, which subsequently becomes language-specific. This closely aligns with existing findings in LLM interpretability showing that models tend to operate in an abstract conceptual space before producing language-specific outputs. We demonstrate that this two-stage representational process extends beyond semantic content to high-level meta-cognitive properties such as problem-difficulty estimation."}

A widely used alternative, Monte Carlo Estimation (MCE), defines process rewards as the probability that a policy model reaches the correct final answer from a given reasoning step. However, step correctness is an intrinsic property of the reasoning trajectory, and should be invariant to policy choice. Our empirical findings show that MCE producing policy-dependent rewards that induce label noise, including false positives that reward incorrect steps and false negatives that penalize correct ones. To address above challenges, we propose a two-stage framework to mitigate noisy supervision. In the labeling stage, we introduce a reflection-aware label correction mechanism that uses a large language model (LLM) as a judge to detect reflection and self-correction behaviors related to the current reasoning step, thereby suppressing overestimated rewards.

To address this, we introduce VISPA, a training-free pluralistic alignment framework, that enables direct control over value expression by dynamic selection and internal model activation steering. Across extensive empirical studies spanning multiple models and evaluation settings, we show VISPA is performant across all pluralistic alignment modes in healthcare and beyond. Further analysis reveals VISPA is adaptable with different steering initiations, model, and/or values. These results suggest that pluralistic alignment can be achieved through internal activation mechanisms, offering a scalable path toward language models that serves all."}

Nationality Prediction via Large Language Model Associative Memory", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) possess extensive world knowledge, yet methods for effectively eliciting this knowledge remain underexplored. Nationality and region prediction tasks require understanding of not only linguistic features but also cultural and historical background, making LLM world knowledge particularly valuable. However, conventional LLM prompting methods rely on direct reasoning approaches, which have limitations in applying abstract linguistic rules. We propose LLM Associative Memory Agents (LAMA), a novel framework that leverages LLM world knowledge as associative memory. Rather than directly inferring nationality from names, LAMA recalls famous individuals with the same name and aggregates their nationalities through indirect reasoning. A dual-agent architecture comprising a Person Agent and a Media Agent, specialized in different knowledge domains, recalls famous individuals in parallel, generating Top-1 predictions through voting and Top-K predictions through conditional completion. On a 99-country nationality prediction task, LAMA achieved 0.817 accuracy, substantially outperforming conventional LLM prompting methods and neural models. Our experiments reveal that LLMs exhibit higher reliability in recalling concrete examples than in abstract reasoning, that recall-based approaches are robust to low-frequency nationalities independent of data frequency distributions, and that the dual-agent architecture functions complementarily to produce synergistic effects. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of a new multi-agent system that retrieves and aggregates LLM knowledge rather than prompting reasoning."}

Efforts based on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) have attempted to address these assumptions but continue to reinforce what we term the SPECIALISATION FALLACY-the belief that specialised medical LLMs are inherently superior for CQA. To address this assumption, we introduce MEDASSESS-X, a deployment-industry-oriented CQA framework that applies alignment at inference time rather than through SFT. MEDASSESS-X uses lightweight steering vectors to guide model activations toward medically consistent reasoning without updating model weights or requiring domain-specific retraining. This inference-time alignment layer stabilises CQA performance across both general-purpose and specialised medical LLMs, thereby resolving the SPECIALISATION FALLACY. Empirically, MEDASSESS-X delivers consistent gains across all LLM families, improving Accuracy by up to +6%, Factual Consistency by +7%, and reducing Safety Error Rate by as much as 50%."}

The project addresses a central methodological challenge in educational and interactional research: the analysis of verbal, paraverbal, and non-verbal data is currently carried out manually, making it extremely time-consuming and difficult to scale. TRAIMA explores how machine learning approaches could contribute to the categorisation and classification of such interactions. The project focuses specifically on explanatory and collaborative sequences occurring in classroom interactions, particularly in French as a Foreign Language (FLE) and French as a First Language (FLM) contexts. These sequences are analysed as inherently multimodal phenomena, combining spoken language with prosody, gestures, posture, gaze, and spatial positioning. A key theoretical contribution of the project is the precise linguistic and interactional definition of explanatory discourse as a tripartite sequence (opening, explanatory core, closure), drawing on discourse analysis and interactional linguistics. A substantial part of the research is devoted to the methodological foundations of transcription, which constitute a critical bottleneck for any form of automation. The report provides a detailed state of the art of existing transcription conventions (ICOR, Mondada, GARS, VALIBEL, Ferr{é}), highlighting their respective strengths and limitations when applied to multimodal classroom data. Through comparative analyses of manually transcribed sequences, the project demonstrates the inevitable variability and interpretative dimension of transcription practices, depending on theoretical positioning and analytical goals. Empirical work is based on several corpora, notably the INTER-EXPLIC corpus (approximately 30 hours of classroom interaction) and the EXPLIC-LEXIC corpus, which serve both as testing grounds for manual annotation and as reference datasets for future automation. Particular attention is paid to teacher gestures (kin{é}sic and proxemic resources), prosodic features, and their functional role in meaning construction and learner comprehension. The project also highlights the strategic role of the Techn{é}LAB platform, which provides advanced multimodal data capture (multi-camera video, synchronized audio, eye-tracking, digital interaction traces) and constitutes both a research infrastructure and a test environment for the development of automated tools. In conclusion, TRAIMA does not aim to deliver a fully operational automated system, but rather to establish a rigorous methodological framework for the automatic processing of multimodal pedagogical interactions. The project identifies transcription conventions, annotation categories, and analytical units that are compatible with machine learning approaches, while emphasizing the need for theoretical explicitness and researcher reflexivity. TRAIMA thus lays the groundwork for future interdisciplinary research at the intersection of didactics, discourse analysis, multimodality, and artificial intelligence in education."}

We present a mechanistic study of how race and ethnicity are represented and operationalized within LLMs. Using two publicly available datasets spanning toxicity-related generation and clinical narrative understanding tasks, we analyze three open-source models with a reproducible interpretability pipeline combining probing, neuron-level attribution, and targeted intervention. We find that demographic information is distributed across internal units with substantial cross-model variation. Although some units encode sensitive or stereotype-related associations from pretraining, identical demographic cues can induce qualitatively different behaviors. Interventions suppressing such neurons reduce bias but leave substantial residual effects, suggesting behavioral rather than representational change and motivating more systematic mitigation."}

This increase leads to higher computational costs and longer Time to First Token (TTFT). To mitigate this issue, existing solutions aim to reuse the preprocessed KV cache of each retrieved chunk to accelerate RAG. However, the lack of cross-chunk contextual information leads to a significant drop in generation quality, leaving the potential benefits of KV cache reuse largely unfulfilled. The challenge lies in how to reuse the precomputed KV cache of chunks while preserving generation quality. We propose FusionRAG, a novel inference framework that optimizes both the preprocessing and reprocessing stages of RAG. In the offline preprocessing stage, we embed information from other related text chunks into each chunk, while in the online reprocessing stage, we recompute the KV cache for tokens that the model focuses on. As a result, we achieve a better trade-off between generation quality and efficiency. According to our experiments, FusionRAG significantly improves generation quality at the same recomputation ratio compared to previous state-of-the-art solutions. By recomputing fewer than 15% of the tokens, FusionRAG achieves up to 70% higher normalized F1 scores than baselines and reduces TTFT by 2.66x-9.39x compared to Full Attention."}

In this work, we reframe test-time adaptation as a budget-constrained memory consolidation problem, focusing on which parts of the context should be consolidated into working memory under limited computation. We propose Gdwm (Gated Differentiable Working Memory), a framework that introduces a write controller to gate the consolidation process. The controller estimates Contextual Utility, an information-theoretic measure of long-range contextual dependence, and allocates gradient steps accordingly while maintaining global coverage. Experiments on ZeroSCROLLS and LongBench v2 demonstrate that Gdwm achieves comparable or superior performance with 4$\\times$ fewer gradient steps than uniform baselines, establishing a new efficiency-performance Pareto frontier for test-time adaptation."}

However, such evaluations implicitly assume that spoken inputs remain semantically answerable, an assumption that often fails in real-world interaction when essential information is missing. In this work, we introduce a repair-aware evaluation setting that explicitly distinguishes between answerable and unanswerable audio inputs. We define answerability as a property of the input itself and construct paired evaluation conditions using a semantic-acoustic masking protocol. Based on this setting, we propose the Evaluability Awareness and Repair (EAR) score, a non-compensatory metric that jointly evaluates task competence under answerable conditions and repair behavior under unanswerable conditions. Experiments on two spoken QA benchmarks across diverse LALMs reveal a consistent gap between answer accuracy and conversational reliability: while many models perform well when inputs are answerable, most fail to recognize semantic unanswerability and initiate appropriate conversational repair. These findings expose a limitation of prevailing accuracy-centric evaluation practices and motivate reliability assessments that treat unanswerable inputs as cues for repair and continued interaction."}

Our analysis reveals that while models demonstrate high proficiency in static objective tasks, their performance precipitates in dynamic clinical dialogues, identifying that the primary bottleneck lies not in knowledge retention, but in the critical challenges of active information gathering and dynamic state tracking. Mapping \"Guideline Adherence\" versus \"Decision Quality\" reveals a prevalent \"High Efficacy, Low Safety\" risk in general models. Furthermore, we quantify the impact of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). While RAG mitigates hallucinations in static tasks, its efficacy in dynamic workflows is limited and heterogeneous, sometimes causing degradation.

In this work, we present a comprehensive evaluation of dLLMs (e.g., LLaDA, Dream) across two distinct agentic paradigms: Embodied Agents (requiring long-horizon planning) and Tool-Calling Agents (requiring precise formatting). Contrary to the efficiency hype, our results on Agentboard and BFCL reveal a \"bitter lesson\": current dLLMs fail to serve as reliable agentic backbones, frequently leading to systematically failure. (1) In Embodied settings, dLLMs suffer repeated attempts, failing to branch under temporal feedback. (2) In Tool-Calling settings, dLLMs fail to maintain symbolic precision (e.g. strict JSON schemas) under diffusion noise. To assess the potential of dLLMs in agentic workflows, we introduce DiffuAgent, a multi-agent evaluation framework that integrates dLLMs as plug-and-play cognitive cores.

In contrast, multi-task approaches based on the HateXplain benchmark learn to explain and classify simultaneously. However, results from HateXplain-based algorithms show that predicted attention varies considerably when it should be constant. This attention variability can lead to inconsistent interpretations, instability of predictions, and learning difficulties. To solve this problem, we propose the BiAtt-BiRNN-HateXplain (Bidirectional Attention BiRNN HateXplain) model which is easier to explain compared to LLMs which are more complex in view of the need for transparency, and will take into account the sequential aspect of the input data during explainability thanks to a BiRNN layer. Thus, if the explanation is correctly estimated, thanks to multi-task learning (explainability and classification task), the model could classify better and commit fewer unintentional bias errors related to communities.

The resulting benchmark comprises 10,962 instances across seven languages and 14 fine-grained emotion categories, with each language including 400 multimodal and 1,166 text-only samples. Comprehensive evaluations of 17 representative multilingual models reveal a dissociation between language consistency and cultural alignment, demonstrating that culturally grounded affective understanding remains a significant challenge for current models."}

Triple Classification~(TC) aims to determine the validity of triples from KGs. Recently, text-based methods learn entity and relation representations from natural language descriptions, significantly improving the generalization capabilities of TC models and setting new benchmarks in performance. However, there are still two critical challenges. First, existing methods often ignore the effective semantic interaction among different KG components. Second, most approaches adopt single binary classification training objective, leading to insufficient semantic representation learning. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{SASA}, a novel framework designed to enhance TC models via separated attention mechanism and semantic-aware contrastive learning~(CL). Specifically, we first propose separated attention mechanism to encode triples into decoupled contextual representations and then fuse them through a more effective interactive way. Then, we introduce semantic-aware hierarchical CL as auxiliary training objective to guide models in improving their discriminative capabilities and achieving sufficient semantic learning, considering both local level and global level CL. Experimental results across two benchmark datasets demonstrate that SASA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. In terms of accuracy, we advance the state-of-the-art by +5.9\\% on FB15k-237 and +3.4\\% on YAGO3-10."}

This paper introduces the Simplification Profiler, a diagnostic toolkit that generates a multidimensional, interpretable fingerprint of simplified texts. Multiple aggregated simplifications of a model result in a model's fingerprint. This novel evaluation paradigm is particularly vital for languages, where the data scarcity problem is magnified when creating flexible models for diverse target groups rather than a single, fixed simplification style. We propose that measuring a model's unique behavioral signature is more relevant in this context as an alternative to correlating metrics with human preferences. We operationalize this with a practical meta-evaluation of our fingerprints' descriptive power, which bypasses the need for large, human-rated datasets. This test measures if a simple linear classifier can reliably identify various model configurations by their created simplifications, confirming that our metrics are sensitive to a model's specific characteristics. The Profiler can distinguish high-level behavioral variations between prompting strategies and fine-grained changes from prompt engineering, including few-shot examples. Our complete feature set achieves classification F1-scores up to 71.9 %, improving upon simple baselines by over 48 percentage points. The Simplification Profiler thus offers developers a granular, actionable analysis to build more effective and truly adaptive text simplification systems."}

Existing studies usually follow static rewrite, retrieve, and generate pipelines, which optimize different procedures separately and overlook the mixed-initiative action optimization simultaneously. Although the recent developments in deep search agents demonstrate the effectiveness in jointly optimizing retrieval and generation via reasoning, these approaches focus on single-turn scenarios, which might lack the ability to handle multi-turn interactions.

Token-oriented methods, such as pruning and skipping, have shown promise in reducing inference latency, but still suffer from inherently limited acceleration potential, outdated proxy signals, and redundancy interference, thus yielding suboptimal speed-accuracy trade-offs. To address these challenges, we propose SPTS (Self-Predictive Token Skipping), a training-free framework for efficient long-context LLM inference. Specifically, motivated by the thought of probing the influence of targeted skipping layers, we design two component-specific strategies for selective token skipping: Partial Attention Probing (PAP) for multi-head attention, which selects informative tokens by performing partial forward attention computation, and Low-rank Transformation Probing (LTP) for feed forward network, which constructs a low-rank proxy network to predict token transformations. Furthermore, a Multi-Stage Delayed Pruning (MSDP) strategy reallocates the skipping budget and progressively prunes redundant tokens across layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving up to 2.46$\\times$ and 2.29$\\times$ speedups for prefilling and end-to-end generation, respectively, while maintaining state-of-the-art model performance.

Our novel benchmark PMR-Bench contains 1569 unique messages and 2,000+ high-quality test pairs for pairwise medical urgency assessment alongside a scalable training data generation pipeline.

Yet rigorous evaluation remains a significant challenge as static question-answer pairs provide only a snapshot of performance, compressing complex behavior into a single accuracy metric. This limitation is especially true in complex, rule-bound domains such as law, where existing benchmarks are costly to build and ill suited for isolating specific failure modes. To address this, we introduce OpenExempt, a framework and benchmark for diagnostic evaluation of legal reasoning. The OpenExempt Framework uses expert-crafted symbolic representations of U.S. Bankruptcy Code statutes to dynamically generate a large space of natural language reasoning tasks and their machine-computable solutions on demand. This gives users fine-grained control over task complexity and scope, allowing individual reasoning skills to be probed in isolation. Using this system, we construct the OpenExempt Benchmark, a diagnostic benchmark for legal reasoning with 9,765 samples across nine evaluation suites designed to carefully probe model capabilities. Experiments on 13 diverse language models reveal sharp performance cliffs that emerge only under longer reasoning paths and in the presence of obfuscating statements. We release the framework and benchmark publicly to support research aimed at understanding and improving the next generation of reasoning systems."}

Mr Dre consists of (1) a unified long-form report evaluation protocol spanning comprehensiveness, factuality, and presentation, and (2) a human-verified feedback simulation pipeline for multi-turn revision. Our analysis of five diverse DRAs reveals a critical limitation: while agents can address most user feedback, they also regress on 16-27% of previously covered content and citation quality. Over multiple revision turns, even the best-performing agents leave significant headroom, as they continue to disrupt content outside the feedback's scope and fail to preserve earlier edits.

To address this, we revisit autoregressive modeling as a foundation and reformulate diffusion-style training into a structured multi-group prediction process. We propose Any-order Any-subset Autoregressive modeling (A3), a generalized framework that extends the standard AR factorization to arbitrary token groups and generation orders. A3 preserves the probabilistic rigor and multi-layer dependency modeling of AR while inheriting diffusion models' flexibility for parallel and bidirectional generation. We implement A3 through a two-stream attention architecture and a progressive adaptation strategy that transitions pretrained AR models toward any-order prediction. Experiments on question answering, commonsense reasoning, and story infilling demonstrate that A3 outperforms diffusion-based models while maintaining flexible decoding.

Existing alignment strategies predominantly rely on resource-intensive training or fine-tuning, which attempt to compress dynamic environmental rules into static model parameters. However, such parametric encapsulation is inherently rigid, struggling to adapt to the open-ended variability of physical dynamics without continuous, costly retraining. To bridge this gap, we introduce WorldMind, a framework that autonomously constructs a symbolic World Knowledge Repository by synthesizing environmental feedback. Specifically, it unifies Process Experience to enforce physical feasibility via prediction errors and Goal Experience to guide task optimality through successful trajectories.

We frame classification as representation selection over the full token-layer hidden-state tensor, rather than committing to a fixed token or fixed layer (e.g., first-token logits or final-layer pooling). To implement this, we introduce a two-stage aggregator that (i) summarizes tokens within each layer and (ii) aggregates across layer summaries to form a single representation for classification.

We evaluate 12 LLMs to analyze attack success rates, behavioral responses, and further investigate mitigation strategies ranging from inference-time prompting to post-training alignment. Experimental results reveal substantial vulnerabilities and heterogeneous robustness across models. OI-Bench is expected to support more systematic evaluation of LLM robustness to directive interference within choice-based interfaces."}

However, climate communication unfolds across structurally distinct platforms with fundamentally different incentive structures: paid advertising ecosystems incentivize targeted, strategic persuasion, while public social media platforms host largely organic, user-driven discourse. Existing computational studies typically analyze these environments in isolation, limiting our ability to distinguish institutional messaging from public expression. In this work, we present a comparative analysis of climate discourse across paid advertisements on Meta (previously known as Facebook) and public posts on Bluesky from July 2024 to September 2025. We introduce an interpretable, end-to-end thematic discovery and assignment framework that clusters texts by semantic similarity and leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate concise, human-interpretable theme labels. We evaluate the quality of the induced themes against traditional topic modeling baselines using both human judgments and an LLM-based evaluator, and further validate their semantic coherence through downstream stance prediction and theme-guided retrieval tasks. Applying the resulting themes, we characterize systematic differences between paid climate messaging and public climate discourse and examine how thematic prevalence shifts around major political events. Our findings show that platform-level incentives are reflected in the thematic structure, stance alignment, and temporal responsiveness of climate narratives. While our empirical analysis focuses on climate communication, the proposed framework is designed to support comparative narrative analysis across heterogeneous communication environments."}

In this paper we analyze the tokenizers of ten popular LMs to better understand their designs and per-language tokenization premiums. We also propose a mechanism to reduce tokenization premiums in pre-trained models, by post-hoc additions to the token vocabulary that coalesce multi-token characters into single tokens. We apply this methodology to 12 low-resource languages, demonstrating that the original and compressed inputs often have similar last hidden states when run through the Llama 3.2 1B model."}

In a way this is no surprise: manually checking registrations against papers is labour- and time-intensive, requiring careful reading across formats and expertise across domains. The advent of AI unlocks new possibilities in facilitating this activity. We present RegCheck, a modular LLM-assisted tool designed to help researchers, reviewers, and editors from across scientific disciplines compare study registrations with their corresponding papers. Importantly, RegCheck keeps human expertise and judgement in the loop by (i) ensuring that users are the ones who determine which features should be compared, and (ii) presenting the most relevant text associated with each feature to the user, facilitating (rather than replacing) human discrepancy judgements. RegCheck also generates shareable reports with unique RegCheck IDs, enabling them to be easily shared and verified by other users. RegCheck is designed to be adaptable across scientific domains, as well as registration and publication formats. In this paper we provide an overview of the motivation, workflow, and design principles of RegCheck, and we discuss its potential as an extensible infrastructure for reproducible science with an example use case."}

This state, implemented as a structured system-prompt summary, is updated at each timestep via feedback-driven text rewrites, enabling learning without parameter updates. Under a fixed token budget, LLM-as-RNN corrects errors and retains task-relevant patterns, effectively performing online learning through language. We evaluate the method on three sequential benchmarks in healthcare, meteorology, and finance across Llama, Gemma, and GPT model families.

We introduce \"sockpuppetting'', a simple method for jailbreaking open-weight LLMs by inserting an acceptance sequence (e.g., \"Sure, here is how to...'') at the start of a model's output and allowing it to complete the response. Requiring only a single line of code and no optimization, sockpuppetting achieves up to 80% higher attack success rate (ASR) than GCG on Qwen3-8B in per-prompt comparisons. We also explore a hybrid approach that optimizes the adversarial suffix within the assistant message block rather than the user prompt, increasing ASR by 64% over GCG on Llama-3.1-8B in a prompt-agnostic setting. The results establish sockpuppetting as an effective low-cost attack accessible to unsophisticated adversaries, highlighting the need for defences against output-prefix injection in open-weight models."}

The main challenge now is to assess the uncertainty of answers, which can help prevent misleading or serious hallucinations for users. Although current methods analyze long reasoning sequences by filtering unrelated tokens and examining potential connections between nearby tokens or sentences, the temporal spread of confidence is often overlooked. This oversight can lead to inflated overall confidence, even when earlier steps exhibit very low confidence. To address this issue, we propose a novel method that incorporates inter-step attention to analyze semantic correlations across steps. For handling long-horizon responses, we introduce a hidden confidence mechanism to retain historical confidence information, which is then combined with stepwise confidence to produce a more accurate overall estimate. We evaluate our method on the GAOKAO math benchmark and the CLadder causal reasoning dataset using mainstream open-source large language models.

As a result, these methods are often sensitive to superficial factors such as response length or verbosity, and struggle to distinguish correct reasoning from confidently stated errors. We propose to characterize the stepwise confidence signal using Signal Temporal Logic (STL). Using a discriminative STL mining procedure, we discover temporal formulas that distinguish confidence signals of correct and incorrect responses. Our analysis found that the STL patterns generalize across tasks, and numeric parameters exhibit sensitivity to individual questions. Based on these insights, we develop a confidence estimation approach that informs STL blocks with parameter hypernetworks. Experiments on multiple reasoning tasks show our confidence scores are more calibrated than the baselines."}

Most individual-level SDOH data is collected through structured screening tools, which lack the flexibility to capture the complexity of patient experiences and unique needs of a clinic's population. This study explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to extract structured SDOH information from unstructured patient life stories and evaluate the predictive value of both the extracted features and the narratives themselves for assessing diabetes control. We collected unstructured interviews from 65 T2D patients aged 65 and older, focused on their lived experiences, social context, and diabetes management. These narratives were analyzed using LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation to produce concise, actionable qualitative summaries for clinical interpretation and structured quantitative SDOH ratings for risk prediction modeling. The structured SDOH ratings were used independently and in combination with traditional laboratory biomarkers as inputs to linear and tree-based machine learning models (Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, and XGBoost) to demonstrate how unstructured narrative data can be applied in conventional risk prediction workflows. Finally, we evaluated several LLMs on their ability to predict a patient's level of diabetes control (low, medium, high) directly from interview text with A1C values redacted. LLMs achieved 60% accuracy in predicting diabetes control levels from interview text. This work demonstrates how LLMs can translate unstructured SDOH-related data into structured insights, offering a scalable approach to augment clinical risk models and decision-making."}

Across five mainstream Large Language Models (LLMs) and three domains (factual knowledge, medical QA, and social bias), we analyze how different persuasive strategies influence belief stability over multiple interaction turns. We further examine whether meta-cognition prompting (i.e., eliciting self-reported confidence) affects resistance to persuasion.

However, LLMs can inadvertently answer beyond a user's permission scope, leaking sensitive content, thus making it difficult to deploy knowledge-base QA under fine-grained access control requirements. In this work, we identify a geometric regularity in intermediate activations: for the same query, representations induced by different permission scopes cluster distinctly and are readily separable. Building on this separability, we propose Activation-space Anchored Access Control (AAAC), a training-free framework for multi-class permission control. AAAC constructs an anchor bank, with one permission anchor per class, from a small offline sample set and requires no fine-tuning. At inference time, a multi-anchor steering mechanism redirects each query's activations toward the anchor-defined authorized region associated with the current user, thereby suppressing over-privileged generations by design. Finally, extensive experiments across three LLM families demonstrate that AAAC reduces permission violation rates by up to 86.5% and prompt-based attack success rates by 90.7%, while improving response usability with minor inference overhead compared to baselines."}

We introduce token-level anomaly detection, a novel paradigm that enables fine-grained localization of anomalies within text. We formally define text anomalies at both document and token-levels, and propose a unified detection framework that operates across multiple levels. To facilitate research in this direction, we collect and annotate three benchmark datasets spanning spam, reviews and grammar errors with token-level labels. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework get better performance than other 6 baselines, opening new possibilities for precise anomaly localization in text.

An Investigation into Language Bias of Pairwise LLM-as-a-Judge", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI"], "comment": null, "summary": "Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have incentivized the development of LLM-as-a-judge, an application of LLMs where they are used as judges to decide the quality of a certain piece of text given a certain context. However, previous studies have demonstrated that LLM-as-a-judge can be biased towards different aspects of the judged texts, which often do not align with human preference. One of the identified biases is language bias, which indicates that the decision of LLM-as-a-judge can differ based on the language of the judged texts. In this paper, we study two types of language bias in pairwise LLM-as-a-judge: (1) performance disparity between languages when the judge is prompted to compare options from the same language, and (2) bias towards options written in major languages when the judge is prompted to compare options of two different languages. We find that for same-language judging, there exist significant performance disparities across language families, with European languages consistently outperforming African languages, and this bias is more pronounced in culturally-related subjects. For inter-language judging, we observe that most models favor English answers, and that this preference is influenced more by answer language than question language. Finally, we investigate whether language bias is in fact caused by low-perplexity bias, a previously identified bias of LLM-as-a-judge, and we find that while perplexity is slightly correlated with language bias, language bias cannot be fully explained by perplexity only."}

The temporal version of that task, temporal knowledge graph extraction (TKGE), involves extracting temporally grounded facts from text, represented as semantic quadruples (subject, relation, object, timestamp). Many recent systems take advantage of large language models (LLMs), which are becoming a new cornerstone of the web due to their performance on many tasks across the natural language processing (NLP) field. Despite the importance of TKGE, existing datasets for training and evaluation remain scarce, and contamination of evaluation data is an unaddressed issue, potentially inflating LLMs' perceived performance due to overlaps between training and evaluation sets. To mitigate these challenges, we propose a novel synthetic evaluation dataset constructed from predicted future, previously unseen temporal facts, thereby eliminating contamination and enabling robust and unbiased benchmarking. Our dataset creation involves a two-step approach: (1) Temporal Knowledge Graph Forecasting (TKGF) generates plausible future quadruples, which are subsequently filtered to adhere to the original knowledge base schema; (2) LLMs perform quadruple-to-text generation, creating semantically aligned textual descriptions. We benchmark Extract, Define and Canonicalize (EDC), a state-of-the-art LLM-based extraction framework, demonstrating that LLM performance decreases when evaluated on our dataset compared to a dataset of known facts. We publicly release our dataset consisting of 4.2K future quadruples and corresponding textual descriptions, along with the generation methodology, enabling continuous creation of unlimited future temporal datasets to serve as long-term, contamination-free benchmarks for TKGE."}

Mainstream approaches based on modality-invariant and modality-specific factorization or on complex fusion still rely on spatiotemporal mixed modeling. This ignores spatiotemporal heterogeneity, leading to spatiotemporal information asymmetry and thus limited performance. Hence, we propose TSDA, Temporal-Spatial Decouple before Act, which explicitly decouples each modality into temporal dynamics and spatial structural context before any interaction. For every modality, a temporal encoder and a spatial encoder project signals into separate temporal and spatial body. Factor-Consistent Cross-Modal Alignment then aligns temporal features only with their temporal counterparts across modalities, and spatial features only with their spatial counterparts. Factor specific supervision and decorrelation regularization reduce cross factor leakage while preserving complementarity. A Gated Recouple module subsequently recouples the aligned streams for task. Extensive experiments show that TSDA outperforms baselines. Ablation analysis studies confirm the necessity and interpretability of the design."}

Existing alignment strategies primarily follow two paths: one assumes a universal value set for a unified goal (i.e., one-size-fits-all), while the other treats every individual as unique to customize models (i.e., individual-level). However, assuming a monolithic value space marginalizes minority norms, while tailoring individual models is prohibitively expensive. Recognizing that human society is organized into social clusters with high intra-group value alignment, we propose community-level alignment as a \"middle ground\". Practically, we introduce CommunityBench, the first large-scale benchmark for community-level alignment evaluation, featuring four tasks grounded in Common Identity and Common Bond theory. With CommunityBench, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of various foundation models on CommunityBench, revealing that current LLMs exhibit limited capacity to model community-specific preferences. Furthermore, we investigate the potential of community-level alignment in facilitating individual modeling, providing a promising direction for scalable and pluralistic alignment."}

Existing static compression methods often fail to preserve globally important information, principally because they overlook the attention drift phenomenon where token significance evolves dynamically. Although recent dynamic retrieval approaches attempt to address this issue, they typically suffer from coarse-grained caching strategies and incur high I/O overhead due to frequent data transfers. To overcome these limitations, we propose HeteroCache, a training-free dynamic compression framework. Our method is built on two key insights: attention heads exhibit diverse temporal heterogeneity, and there is significant spatial redundancy among heads within the same layer. Guided by these insights, HeteroCache categorizes heads based on stability and redundancy. Consequently, we apply a fine-grained weighting strategy that allocates larger cache budgets to heads with rapidly shifting attention to capture context changes, thereby addressing the inefficiency of coarse-grained strategies. Furthermore, we employ a hierarchical storage mechanism in which a subset of representative heads monitors attention shift, and trigger an asynchronous, on-demand retrieval of contexts from the CPU, effectively hiding I/O latency. Finally, experiments demonstrate that HeteroCache achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple long-context benchmarks and accelerates decoding by up to $3\\times$ compared to the original model in the 224K context. Our code will be open-source."}

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted in healthcare due to their extensive knowledge reserves, retrieval, and communication capabilities. While LLMs show promise and excel at medical benchmarks, their diagnostic reasoning and inquiry skills are constrained. To mitigate this issue, we propose (1) Clinical Diagnostic Reasoning Data (CDRD) structure to capture abstract clinical reasoning logic, and a pipeline for its construction, and (2) the Dr. Assistant, a clinical diagnostic model equipped with clinical reasoning and inquiry skills. Its training involves a two-stage process: SFT, followed by RL with a tailored reward function. We also introduce a benchmark to evaluate both diagnostic reasoning and inquiry. Our experiments demonstrate that the Dr. Assistant outperforms open-source models and achieves competitive performance to closed-source models, providing an effective solution for clinical diagnostic inquiry guidance."}

While effective, this formulation assumes access to structured text and incurs substantial token overhead, which is misaligned with many real-world scenarios where tables appear as visual artifacts in documents or webpages. We investigate whether compact optical representations can serve as an efficient interface for executable semantic parsing. We present OptiSQL, a vision-driven framework that generates executable SQL directly from table images and natural language questions using compact optical tokens. OptiSQL leverages an OCR-oriented visual encoder to compress table structure and content into a small set of optical tokens and fine-tunes a pretrained decoder for SQL generation while freezing the encoder to isolate representation sufficiency. Experiments on a visualized version of Spider 2.0-Snow show that OptiSQL retains strong execution accuracy while reducing table input tokens by an order of magnitude. Robustness analyses further demonstrate that optical tokens preserve essential structural information under visual perturbations."}

We propose GRADFILTERING, an objective-agnostic, uncertainty-aware data selection framework that utilizes a small GPT-2 proxy with a LoRA ensemble and aggregates per-example gradients into a Gradient Signal-to-Noise Ratio (G-SNR) utility. Our method matches or surpasses random subsets and strong baselines in most LLM-as-a-judge evaluations as well as in human assessment. Moreover, GRADFILTERING-selected subsets converge faster than competitive filters under the same compute budget, reflecting the benefit of uncertainty-aware scoring."}

GerAV is built from Twitter and Reddit data, with the Reddit part further divided into in-domain and cross-domain message-based subsets, as well as a profile-based subset. This design enables controlled analysis of the effects of data source, topical domain, and text length.

Overall, GerAV provides a challenging and versatile benchmark for advancing research on German and cross-domain AV."}

Simulated Ignorance (SI), prompting models to suppress pre-cutoff knowledge, has emerged as a potential solution. We provide the first systematic test of whether SI can approximate True Ignorance (TI). Across 477 competition-level questions and 9 models, we find that SI fails systematically: (1) cutoff instructions leave a 52% performance gap between SI and TI; (2) chain-of-thought reasoning fails to suppress prior knowledge, even when reasoning traces contain no explicit post-cutoff references; (3) reasoning-optimized models exhibit worse SI fidelity despite superior reasoning trace quality. These findings demonstrate that prompts cannot reliably \"rewind\" model knowledge. We conclude that RF on pre-cutoff events is methodologically flawed; we recommend against using SI-based retrospective setups to benchmark forecasting capabilities."}

However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on whether agents can recall and apply user information, while overlooking whether such personalization is used appropriately. In fact, agents may overuse personal information, producing responses that feel forced, intrusive, or socially inappropriate to users. We refer to this issue as \\emph{over-personalization}. In this work, we formalize over-personalization into three types: Irrelevance, Repetition, and Sycophancy, and introduce \\textbf{OP-Bench} a benchmark of 1,700 verified instances constructed from long-horizon dialogue histories. Using \\textbf{OP-Bench}, we evaluate multiple large language models and memory-augmentation methods, and find that over-personalization is widespread when memory is introduced. Further analysis reveals that agents tend to retrieve and over-attend to user memories even when unnecessary. To address this issue, we propose \\textbf{Self-ReCheck}, a lightweight, model-agnostic memory filtering mechanism that mitigates over-personalization while preserving personalization performance. Our work takes an initial step toward more controllable and appropriate personalization in memory-augmented dialogue systems."}

However, such properties remain under-explored in machine translation (MT), a complex, non-deterministic NLP task. In this study, we systematically evaluate modern MT systems and identify temperature-constrained Non-Deterministic MT (ND-MT) as a distinct phenomenon. Additionally, we demonstrate that ND-MT exhibits significant potential in addressing the multi-modality issue that has long challenged MT research and provides higher-quality candidates than Deterministic MT (D-MT) under temperature constraints. However, ND-MT introduces new challenges in evaluating system performance. Specifically, the evaluation framework designed for D-MT fails to yield consistent evaluation results when applied to ND-MT. We further investigate this emerging challenge by evaluating five state-of-the-art ND-MT systems across three open datasets using both lexical-based and semantic-based metrics at varying sampling sizes. The results reveal a Buckets effect across these systems: the lowest-quality candidate generated by ND-MT consistently determines the overall system ranking across different sampling sizes for all reasonable metrics. Furthermore, we propose the ExpectoSample strategy to automatically assess the reliability of evaluation metrics for selecting robust ND-MT."}

To demonstrate the strength of the framework, we first introduce a Human Chain-of-Thought (HCoT) annotation protocol to improve the diagnostic capability of existing judge benchmarks by separating evaluation into explicit dimensions: content (C), voice quality (VQ), and paralinguistics (P). Using this data, TRACE constructs a textual blueprint of inexpensive audio signals and prompts an LLM to render dimension-wise judgments, fusing them into an overall rating via a deterministic policy. TRACE achieves higher agreement with human raters than ALMs and transcript-only LLM judges while being significantly more cost-effective. We will release the HCoT annotations and the TRACE framework to enable scalable and human-aligned S2S evaluation."}

This allows us to probe the voice-activity projection model, an S3R-based turn-taking model. We find that prediction on prosody-matched, unintelligible noise is similar to accuracy on clean speech. This reveals both prosodic and lexical cues support turn-taking, but either can be used in isolation. Hence, future models may only require prosody, providing privacy and potential performance benefits. When either prosodic or lexical information is disrupted, the model exploits the other without further training, indicating they are encoded in S3Rs with limited interdependence. Results are consistent in CPC-based and wav2vec2.0 S3Rs. We discuss our findings and highlight a number of directions for future work. All code is available to support future research."}

However, current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models require substantial computational resources and sacrifice language generation capabilities to maximize efficiency, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained educational settings that require interpretable, explanation-generating systems. We present \\textit{Pedagogical VLA Framework}, a framework that applies pedagogical alignment to lightweight VLA models through four components: text healing to restore language generation capabilities, large language model (LLM) distillation to transfer pedagogical knowledge, safety training for educational environments, and pedagogical evaluation adjusted to science education contexts. We evaluate Pedagogical VLA Framework across five science demonstrations spanning physics, chemistry, biology, and earth science, using an evaluation framework developed in collaboration with science education experts. Our evaluation assesses both task performance (success rate, protocol compliance, efficiency, safety) and pedagogical quality through teacher surveys and LLM-as-Judge assessment. We additionally provide qualitative analysis of generated texts. Experimental results demonstrate that Pedagogical VLA Framework achieves comparable task performance to baseline models while producing contextually appropriate educational explanations."}

This benchmark challenges agents to execute complex decision-making tasks, such as diagnosis and treatment planning, requiring long-range interactive reasoning directly within raw and high-noise databases. In tackling these tasks, we identify that existing summarization methods inevitably suffer from critical information loss and fractured reasoning continuity. To address this, we propose RetroSum, a novel framework that unifies a retrospective summarization mechanism with an evolving experience strategy. By dynamically re-evaluating interaction history, the retrospective mechanism prevents long-context information loss and ensures unbroken logical coherence. Additionally, the evolving strategy bridges the domain gap by retrieving accumulated experience from a memory bank.

Although recent methods have advanced medical report generation (MRG) and visual question answering (VQA) with medical vision-language models (VLMs), these methods, however, predominantly operate under a sample-isolated inference paradigm, as such processing cases independently without access to longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) or structurally related patient examples. This paradigm limits reasoning to image-derived information alone, which ignores external complementary medical evidence for potentially more accurate diagnosis. To overcome this limitation, we propose \\textbf{HyperWalker}, a \\textit{Deep Diagnosis} framework that reformulates clinical reasoning via dynamic hypergraphs and test-time training. First, we construct a dynamic hypergraph, termed \\textbf{iBrochure}, to model the structural heterogeneity of EHR data and implicit high-order associations among multimodal clinical information. Within this hypergraph, a reinforcement learning agent, \\textbf{Walker}, navigates to and identifies optimal diagnostic paths. To ensure comprehensive coverage of diverse clinical characteristics in test samples, we incorporate a \\textit{linger mechanism}, a multi-hop orthogonal retrieval strategy that iteratively selects clinically complementary neighborhood cases reflecting distinct clinical attributes. Experiments on MRG with MIMIC and medical VQA on EHRXQA demonstrate that HyperWalker achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at: https://github.com/Bean-Young/HyperWalker"}

To this end, we propose a multi-agent prompt optimization framework in which language-model agents jointly propose feature definitions, extract feature values, and evaluate feature quality using dataset-level performance and interpretability feedback. Instruction prompts are iteratively refined based on this structured feedback, enabling optimization over prompts that induce shared feature sets rather than per-example predictions. This formulation departs from prior prompt optimization methods that rely on per-sample supervision and provides a principled mechanism for automatic feature discovery from unstructured text."}

While leveraging diverse teachers seems appealing, effectively fusing their supervisions remains challenging: teacher-student incompatibility risks amplifying hallucinations, and passive supervision fails to ensure genuine logic internalization. To address this, we introduce COMPACT, a framework that adaptively fuses supervisions from different teachers by dynamically weighting teacher gradients based on the student's real-time compatibility evaluated by a multi-dimensional metric: (1) Graph-based Consensus to filter misleading rationales by identifying mainstream reasoning paths; (2) Mutual-Information-based Adaptability to detect \"epiphany moments\" for genuinely understanding the reasoning process rather than merely imitating; and (3) Loss-based Difficulty to assess student receptivity to the teacher's guidance and prevent negative transfer. Extensive experiments and latent space analysis demonstrate that COMPACT effectively integrates diverse reasoning capabilities without damaging the model's original knowledge structure, achieving state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks while mitigating catastrophic forgetting."}

To address this challenge, we propose Tree-aware Aligned Global Sampling (TAGS), a unified framework that leverages a knowledge tree built from fine-grained tags, thereby enabling joint control of global quality, diversity, and target alignment. Using an LLM-based tagger, we extract atomic knowledge concepts, which are organized into a global tree through bottom-up hierarchical clustering. By grounding data instances onto this tree, a tree-aware metric then quantifies data quality and diversity, facilitating effective sampling. Our controllable sampling strategy maximizes tree-level information gain and enforces leaf-level alignment via KL-divergence for specific domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TAGS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

We introduce an abstraction-grounding framework that decomposes conceptual understanding into three capacities: interpretation of abstract concepts (Abstract-Abstract, A-A), grounding of abstractions in concrete events (Abstract-Concrete, A-C), and application of abstract principles to regulate concrete decisions (Concrete-Concrete, C-C). Using human values as a testbed - given their semantic richness and centrality to alignment - we employ probing (detecting value traces in internal activations) and steering (modifying representations to shift behavior). Across six open-source LLMs and ten value dimensions, probing shows that diagnostic probes trained solely on abstract value descriptions reliably detect the same values in concrete event narratives and decision reasoning, demonstrating cross-level transfer. Steering reveals an asymmetry: intervening on value representations causally shifts concrete judgments and decisions (A-C, C-C), yet leaves abstract interpretations unchanged (A-A), suggesting that encoded abstract values function as stable anchors rather than malleable activations. These findings indicate LLMs maintain structured value representations that bridge abstraction and action, providing a mechanistic and operational foundation for building value-driven autonomous AI systems with more transparent, generalizable alignment and control."}

To address this, we propose RM-Distiller, a framework designed to systematically exploit the multifaceted capabilities of teacher LLMs: (1) Refinement capability, which synthesizes highly correlated response pairs to create fine-grained and contrastive signals. (2) Scoring capability, which guides the RM in capturing precise preference strength via a margin-aware optimization objective. (3) Generation capability, which incorporates the teacher's generative distribution to regularize the RM to preserve its fundamental linguistic knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RM-Distiller significantly outperforms traditional distillation methods both on RM benchmarks and reinforcement learning-based alignment, proving that exploiting multifaceted teacher capabilities is critical for effective reward modeling.

Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) offer a transformative alternative, conceptualizing text generation as a holistic, bidirectional denoising process akin to a sculptor refining a masterpiece. However, the potential of DLMs remains largely untapped as they are frequently confined within AR-legacy infrastructures and optimization frameworks. In this Perspective, we identify ten fundamental challenges ranging from architectural inertia and gradient sparsity to the limitations of linear reasoning that prevent DLMs from reaching their ``GPT-4 moment''. We propose a strategic roadmap organized into four pillars: foundational infrastructure, algorithmic optimization, cognitive reasoning, and unified multimodal intelligence. By shifting toward a diffusion-native ecosystem characterized by multi-scale tokenization, active remasking, and latent thinking, we can move beyond the constraints of the causal horizon. We argue that this transition is essential for developing next-generation AI capable of complex structural reasoning, dynamic self-correction, and seamless multimodal integration."}

Layerwise interventions further show that early and late MoE layers support language-specific processing, whereas middle layers serve as language-agnostic capacity hubs.

The setting - out-of-context sentences from news and political manifestos - features sparse moral cues and severe class imbalance. This combination makes fine-grained sentence-level value detection intrinsically difficult, even for strong modern neural models. We first operationalize a binary moral presence task (\"does any value appear?\") and show that it is learnable from single sentences (positive-class F1 $\\approx$ 0.74 with calibrated thresholds). We then compare a presence-gated hierarchy to a direct multi-label classifier under matched compute, both based on DeBERTa-base and augmented with lightweight signals (prior-sentence context, LIWC-22/eMFD/MJD lexica, and topic features). The hierarchy does not outperform direct prediction, indicating that gate recall limits downstream gains. We also benchmark instruction-tuned LLMs - Gemma 2 9B, Llama 3.1 8B, Mistral 8B, and Qwen 2.5 7B - in zero-/few-shot and QLoRA setups and build simple ensembles; a soft-vote supervised ensemble reaches macro-F1 0.332, significantly surpassing the best single supervised model and exceeding prior English-only baselines. Overall, in this scenario, lightweight signals and small ensembles yield the most reliable improvements, while hierarchical gating offers limited benefit. We argue that, under an 8 GB single-GPU constraint and at the 7-9B scale, carefully tuned supervised encoders remain a strong and compute-efficient baseline for structured human value detection, and we outline how richer value structure and sentence-in-document context could further improve performance."}

The probe is a small auxiliary network whose computation is orders of magnitude cheaper than token generation and can be evaluated fully in parallel with inference, enabling near-instantaneous hallucination risk estimation with effectively zero added latency in low-risk cases.

Existing methods assess suitability primarily through student likelihood, favoring trajectories that closely align with the model's current behavior but overlooking more informative ones. Addressing this, we propose Rank-Surprisal Ratio (RSR), a simple metric that captures both alignment and informativeness to assess the suitability of a reasoning trajectory. RSR is motivated by the observation that effective trajectories typically combine low absolute probability with relatively high-ranked tokens under the student model, balancing learning signal strength and behavioral alignment. Concretely, RSR is defined as the ratio of a trajectory's average token-wise rank to its average negative log-likelihood, and is straightforward to compute and interpret. Across five student models and reasoning trajectories from 11 diverse teachers, RSR strongly correlates with post-training performance (average Spearman 0.86), outperforming existing metrics. We further demonstrate its practical utility in both trajectory selection and teacher selection."}

Instead of relying on rule-based interactions, agents can now interact in flexible ways akin to humans. However, this flexibility quickly becomes a problem in fields where errors can be disastrous, such as in a pharmacy context, but the opposite also holds true; a system that is too inflexible will also lead to errors, as it can become too rigid to handle situations that are not accounted for. Work using LLMs in a pharmacy context have adopted a wide scope, accounting for many different medications in brief interactions -- our strategy is the opposite: focus on a more narrow and long task. This not only enables a greater understanding of the task at hand, but also provides insight into what challenges are present in an interaction of longer nature. The main challenge, however, remains the same for a narrow and wide system: it needs to strike a balance between adherence to conversational requirements and flexibility. In an effort to strike such a balance, we present a prototype system meant to provide medication counseling while juggling these two extremes. We also cover our design in constructing such a system, with a focus on methods aiming to fulfill conversation requirements, reduce hallucinations and promote high-quality responses. The methods used have the potential to increase the determinism of the system, while simultaneously not removing the dynamic conversational abilities granted by the usage of LLMs. However, a great deal of work remains ahead, and the development of this kind of system needs to involve continuous testing and a human-in-the-loop. It should also be evaluated outside of commonly used benchmarks for LLMs, as these do not adequately capture the complexities of this kind of conversational system."}

To address these limitations, we explore MIMIC-RD, a rare disease differential diagnosis benchmark constructed by directly mapping clinical text entities to Orphanet. Our methodology involved an initial LLM-based mining process followed by validation from four medical annotators to confirm identified entities were genuine rare diseases. We evaluated various models on our dataset of 145 patients and found that current state-of-the-art LLMs perform poorly on rare disease differential diagnosis, highlighting the substantial gap between existing capabilities and clinical needs.

In this work, we study MoEs through a geometric lens, interpreting routing as a form of soft partitioning of the representation space into overlapping local charts. We introduce a Dual Jacobian-PCA Spectral Geometry probe. It analyzes local function geometry via Jacobian singular-value spectra and representation geometry via weighted PCA of routed hidden states. Using a controlled MLP-MoE setting that permits exact Jacobian computation, we compare dense, Top-k, and fully-soft routing architectures under matched capacity. Across random seeds, we observe that MoE routing consistently reduces local sensitivity, with expert-local Jacobians exhibiting smaller leading singular values and faster spectral decay than dense baselines. At the same time, weighted PCA reveals that expert-local representations distribute variance across a larger number of principal directions, indicating higher effective rank under identical input distributions. We further find that average expert Jacobians are nearly orthogonal, suggesting a decomposition of the transformation into low-overlap expert-specific subspaces rather than scaled variants of a shared map. We analyze how routing sharpness modulates these effects, showing that Top-k routing produces lower-rank, more concentrated expert-local structure, while fully-soft routing yields broader, higher-rank representations. Together, these results support a geometric interpretation of MoEs as soft partitionings of function space that flatten local curvature while redistributing representation variance."}

While Large Language Model (LLM)-as-a-Judge approaches offer scalability, their reliability in evaluating adherence of different types of system instructions remains unverified. This study asks: To what extent does the instruction type of an Application Under Test (AUT) influence the stability of judge evaluations? To address this, we introduce the Scoped Instruction Decomposition Framework to classify AUT instructions into Objective and Subjective types, isolating the factors that drive judge instability. We applied this framework to two representative HR GenAI applications, evaluating the stability of four judge architectures over variable runs. Our results reveal a ``Stability Trap'' characterized by a divergence between Verdict Stability and Reasoning Stability. While judges achieved near-perfect verdict agreement ($>99\\%$) for both objective and subjective evaluations, their accompanying justification traces diverged significantly. Objective instructions requiring quantitative analysis, such as word counting, exhibited reasoning stability as low as $\\approx19\\%$, driven by variances in numeric justifications. Similarly, reasoning stability for subjective instructions varied widely ($35\\%$--$83\\%$) based on evidence granularity, with feature-specific checks failing to reproduce consistent rationale. Conversely, objective instructions focusing on discrete entity extraction achieved high reasoning stability ($>90\\%$). These findings demonstrate that high verdict stability can mask fragile reasoning. Thus, we suggest that auditors scope automated evaluation protocols strictly: delegate all deterministically verifiable logic to code, while reserving LLM judges for complex semantic evaluation."}

In recent years, the rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has enabled new technological approaches to problem-generation tasks. Although existing LLMs can achieve high correctness rates, they generally lack innovation and exhibit poor discrimination. In this paper, we propose the task of innovative math problem generation (IMPG). To solve the IMPG task, this paper proposes a self-evolving, multi-role collaborative framework with fine-grained difficulty guidance. First, a multi-role collaborative mechanism comprising a sampler, generator, evaluator, state machine, and memory is constructed, ensuring the correctness of generated problems through iterative optimization informed by self-assessment and external feedback. Second, we introduce an improved difficulty model to quantify difficulty and provide fine-grained guidance. We adopt the data-driven association-guided path sampling (DAPS) algorithm to enhance the semantic rationality of sampled encodings. Third, we construct the HSM3K-CN dataset, which comprises high-quality high school math problems. A multi-stage training pipeline is adopted, incorporating continual pre-training (CPT), supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and group relative policy optimization (GRPO), to enhance the generation and evaluation capabilities of the base model. Finally, system self-evolution is achieved by transferring evaluation capabilities from the expert model to the apprentice model via distillation. Experiments show that, compared to baseline models, our proposed method significantly improves the innovation of the generated problems while maintaining a high correctness rate."}

However, traditional global norm clipping erroneously presupposes gradient homogeneity across different functional modules, leading to an adverse \"spill-over\" effect where volatile parameters force unnecessary scaling on stable ones. To overcome this, we propose Adaptive Group-wise Gradient Clipping (AGGC). AGGC partitions parameters into groups based on functional types and regulates each according to its historical behavior using an Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Specifically, it constructs an adaptive interval to simultaneously mitigate gradient explosion and vanishing, while employing a time-dependent scheduling mechanism to balance exploration and convergence. Experiments on LLaMA 2-7B, Mistral-7B, and Gemma-7B models show that AGGC consistently outperforms LoRA and frequently surpasses Full Fine-Tuning. On the GSM8K benchmark, Mistral-7B fine-tuned with AGGC achieves an accuracy of 72.93%, exceeding LoRA's 69.5%. AGGC also effectively stabilizes Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), enhancing the logic deduction of Qwen 2.5 and Llama 3.2 models. Experimental results demonstrate that AGGC effectively addresses the limitations of traditional gradient clipping methods, particularly in overcoming gradient heterogeneity, by utilizing a modular, adaptive clipping strategy to stabilize the training process.

At inference time, TAAR truncates the trajectory before the predicted trap segment and adaptively restarts decoding; for severely trapped cases, it applies stronger perturbations, including higher-temperature resampling and an optional structured reboot suffix. Experiments on challenging mathematical and scientific reasoning benchmarks (AIME24, AIME25, GPQA-Diamond, HMMT25, BRUMO25) show that TAAR improves reasoning performance without fine-tuning base model parameters."}

Moreover, progress in this field is hindered by the absence of large-scale dedicated benchmarks, while existing models are often affected by biased initial memory construction that impairs accurate instance localization in complex scenarios, as well as indiscriminate memory accumulation that encodes noise from occlusions or misclassifications, leading to persistent error propagation. This paper advances RS-RVOS research through dual contributions in data and methodology. First, we construct RS-RVOS Bench, the first large-scale benchmark comprising 111 video sequences, about 25,000 frames, and 213,000 temporal referring annotations. Unlike common RVOS benchmarks where many expressions are written with access to the full video context, our dataset adopts a strict causality-aware annotation strategy in which linguistic references are generated solely from the target state in the initial frame. Second, we propose a memory-quality-aware online referring segmentation framework, termed Memory Quality Control with Segment Anything Model (MQC-SAM). MQC-SAM introduces a temporal motion consistency module for initial memory calibration, leveraging short-term motion trajectory priors to correct structural deviations and establish accurate memory anchoring. Furthermore, it incorporates a decoupled attention-based memory integration mechanism with dynamic quality assessment, selectively updating high-confidence semantic features while filtering unreliable information, thereby effectively preventing error accumulation and propagation. Extensive experiments on RS-RVOS Bench demonstrate that MQC-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance."}

In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, a fixed-length number embedding vector that preserves algebraic operations, including addition, multiplication, and comparison, within the field of rational numbers. We propose a novel Neural Isomorphic Field, a neural abstraction of algebraic structures such as groups and fields. The elements of this neural field are embedding vectors that maintain algebraic structure during computations. Our experiments demonstrate that addition performs exceptionally well, achieving over 95 percent accuracy on key algebraic tests such as identity, closure, and associativity. In contrast, multiplication exhibits challenges, with accuracy ranging from 53 percent to 73 percent across various algebraic properties. These findings highlight the model's strengths in preserving algebraic properties under addition while identifying avenues for further improvement in handling multiplication."}

Despite identical source material and parallel query structures, the resulting analyses varied substantially in rhetorical positioning, ideological orientation, and interpretive conclusions. The Russian-language output echoed narratives common in Russian state discourse, characterizing civil society actors as illegitimate elites undermining democratic mandates. The Ukrainian-language output adopted vocabulary characteristic of Western liberal-democratic political science, treating the same actors as legitimate stakeholders within democratic contestation.

Such cases are common in real-world settings, where questions may be misleading, ill-posed, or incompatible with the information. To address this gap, we present AQUA-Bench, a benchmark for Audio Question Unanswerability Assessment. It systematically evaluates three scenarios: Absent Answer Detection (the correct option is missing), Incompatible Answer Set Detection (choices are categorically mismatched with the question), and Incompatible Audio Question Detection (the question is irrelevant or lacks sufficient grounding in the audio). By assessing these cases, AQUA-Bench offers a rigorous measure of model reliability and promotes the development of audio-language systems that are more robust and trustworthy. Our experiments suggest that while models excel on standard answerable tasks, they often face notable challenges with unanswerable ones, pointing to a blind spot in current audio-language understanding."}

We present the first systematic study of Environment-Aware Code Generation (EACG), where generated code must be functionally correct and directly executable under arbitrary software configurations.

This raises the question of whether such workflows can be simulated by a single agent through multi-turn conversations. We investigate this across seven benchmarks spanning coding, mathematics, general question answering, domain-specific reasoning, and real-world planning and tool use. Our results show that a single agent can reach the performance of homogeneous workflows with an efficiency advantage from KV cache reuse, and can even match the performance of an automatically optimized heterogeneous workflow. Building on this finding, we propose \\textbf{OneFlow}, an algorithm that automatically tailors workflows for single-agent execution, reducing inference costs compared to existing automatic multi-agent design frameworks without trading off accuracy. These results position the single-LLM implementation of multi-agent workflows as a strong baseline for MAS research. We also note that single-LLM methods cannot capture heterogeneous workflows due to the lack of KV cache sharing across different LLMs, highlighting future opportunities in developing \\textit{truly} heterogeneous multi-agent systems."}

Despite advances in alignment, even state-of-the-art LLMs remain broadly vulnerable to adversarial prompts, underscoring the urgent need for robust, productive, and generalizable detection mechanisms beyond inefficient, model-specific patches. In this work, we propose Zero-Shot Embedding Drift Detection (ZEDD), a lightweight, low-engineering-overhead framework that identifies both direct and indirect prompt injection attempts by quantifying semantic shifts in embedding space between benign and suspect inputs. ZEDD operates without requiring access to model internals, prior knowledge of attack types, or task-specific retraining, enabling efficient zero-shot deployment across diverse LLM architectures. Our method uses adversarial-clean prompt pairs and measures embedding drift via cosine similarity to capture subtle adversarial manipulations inherent to real-world injection attacks. To ensure robust evaluation, we assemble and re-annotate the comprehensive LLMail-Inject dataset spanning five injection categories derived from publicly available sources. Extensive experiments demonstrate that embedding drift is a robust and transferable signal, outperforming traditional methods in detection accuracy and operational efficiency. With greater than 93% accuracy in classifying prompt injections across model architectures like Llama 3, Qwen 2, and Mistral and a false positive rate of <3%, our approach offers a lightweight, scalable defense layer that integrates into existing LLM pipelines, addressing a critical gap in securing LLM-powered systems to withstand adaptive adversarial threats."}

DAS uses a sequential progression strategy: it randomly partitions the candidate corpus into fixed-size groups, prompts an LLM to select the text most likely written by the same author as a query text, and iteratively re-queries the surviving candidates to produce a ranked top-k list. To make this practical at scale, DAS adds a dense-retrieval prefilter to shrink the search space and a majority-voting style aggregation over multiple independent runs to improve robustness and ranking precision. Experiments on anonymized review data show DAS can recover same-author texts from pools of tens of thousands with accuracy well above chance, demonstrating a realistic privacy risk for anonymous platforms. On standard authorship benchmarks (Enron emails and blog posts), DAS also improves both accuracy and scalability over prior approaches, highlighting a new LLM-enabled de-anonymization vulnerability."}

The proposed approach combines additively homomorphic encryption with secure multi-party computation to enable privacy-preserving verification of demographic parity and equalized odds metrics without revealing protected attribute distributions or individual predictions. A novel batched verification protocol reduces computational complexity from BigO(n^2) to BigO(n \\log n) while maintaining (\\dparam, \\deltap)-differential privacy with dparam = 0.5 and deltap = 10^{-6}. Theoretical analysis establishes information-theoretic lower bounds on the privacy cost of fairness verification, demonstrating that the proposed protocol achieves near-optimal privacy-fairness tradeoffs. Comprehensive experiments across four benchmark datasets (MIMIC-IV healthcare records, Adult Income, CelebA, and a novel FedFair-100 benchmark) demonstrate that CryptoFair-FL reduces fairness violations from 0.231 to 0.031 demographic parity difference while incurring only 2.3 times computational overhead compared to standard federated averaging. The framework successfully defends against attribute inference attacks, maintaining adversarial success probability below 0.05 across all tested configurations.

To support this study, we introduce AraMega-SSum, a novel dataset for Arabic speech summarization. We fine-tune Qwen2.5-Omni (7B) and propose Task-Progressive Curriculum (TPC) along with Aligner-Based Diverse Sampling (ADS), a strategy that constructs information-dense batches by selecting task- and label-balanced examples. Our results reveal a critical efficiency, robustness trade-off: while ADS accelerates initial convergence and boosts paralinguistic F1-scores, its inherent gradient volatility can destabilize generative decoding under prolonged training. Furthermore, while the TPC stabilizes core acoustic mapping, it often induces negative transfer in downstream tasks. We demonstrate that a Hybrid TPC+ADS Strategy provides an optimal training ``recipe'', first establishing a robust representative foundation before employing diversity-aware refinement to capture fine-grained nuances.

Agentic reasoning marks a paradigm shift by reframing LLMs as autonomous agents that plan, act, and learn through continual interaction. In this survey, we organize agentic reasoning along three complementary dimensions. First, we characterize environmental dynamics through three layers: foundational agentic reasoning, which establishes core single-agent capabilities including planning, tool use, and search in stable environments; self-evolving agentic reasoning, which studies how agents refine these capabilities through feedback, memory, and adaptation; and collective multi-agent reasoning, which extends intelligence to collaborative settings involving coordination, knowledge sharing, and shared goals. Across these layers, we distinguish in-context reasoning, which scales test-time interaction through structured orchestration, from post-training reasoning, which optimizes behaviors via reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning. We further review representative agentic reasoning frameworks across real-world applications and benchmarks, including science, robotics, healthcare, autonomous research, and mathematics. This survey synthesizes agentic reasoning methods into a unified roadmap bridging thought and action, and outlines open challenges and future directions, including personalization, long-horizon interaction, world modeling, scalable multi-agent training, and governance for real-world deployment."}

Existing benchmark tasks are either too simplistic to reveal substantial differences or excessively resource-intensive for experimentation. In this work, we propose a refined taxonomy of linear recurrent models and introduce SelectivBench, a set of lightweight and customizable synthetic benchmark tasks for systematically evaluating sequence models. SelectivBench specifically evaluates selectivity in sequence models at small to medium scale, such as the capacity to focus on relevant inputs while ignoring context-based distractors. It employs rule-based grammars to generate sequences with adjustable complexity, incorporating irregular gaps that intentionally violate transition rules. Evaluations of linear recurrent models on SelectivBench reveal performance patterns consistent with results from large-scale language tasks. Our analysis clarifies the roles of essential architectural features: gating and rapid forgetting mechanisms facilitate recall, in-state channel mixing is unnecessary for selectivity, but critical for generalization, and softmax attention remains dominant due to its memory capacity scaling with sequence length. Our benchmark enables targeted, efficient exploration of linear recurrent models and provides a controlled setting for studying behaviors observed in large-scale evaluations.

To address this gap, we introduce SciHorizon-GENE, a large-scale gene-centric benchmark constructed from authoritative biological databases. The benchmark integrates curated knowledge for over 190K human genes and comprises more than 540K questions covering diverse gene-to-function reasoning scenarios relevant to cell type annotation, functional interpretation, and mechanism-oriented analysis. Motivated by behavioral patterns observed in preliminary examinations, SciHorizon-GENE evaluates LLMs along four biologically critical perspectives: research attention sensitivity, hallucination tendency, answer completeness, and literature influence, explicitly targeting failure modes that limit the safe adoption of LLMs in biological interpretation pipelines. We systematically evaluate a wide range of state-of-the-art general-purpose and biomedical LLMs, revealing substantial heterogeneity in gene-level reasoning capabilities and persistent challenges in generating faithful, complete, and literature-grounded functional interpretations.

However, the clinical consequences of this AI-generated data contamination remain unexplored. Here, we show that in the absence of mandatory human verification, this self-referential cycle drives a rapid erosion of pathological variability and diagnostic reliability. By analysing more than 800,000 synthetic data points across clinical text generation, vision-language reporting, and medical image synthesis, we find that models progressively converge toward generic phenotypes regardless of the model architecture. Specifically, rare but critical findings, including pneumothorax and effusions, vanish from the synthetic content generated by AI models, while demographic representations skew heavily toward middle-aged male phenotypes. Crucially, this degradation is masked by false diagnostic confidence; models continue to issue reassuring reports while failing to detect life-threatening pathology, with false reassurance rates tripling to 40%. Blinded physician evaluation confirms that this decoupling of confidence and accuracy renders AI-generated documentation clinically useless after just two generations. We systematically evaluate three mitigation strategies, finding that while synthetic volume scaling fails to prevent collapse, mixing real data with quality-aware filtering effectively preserves diversity. Ultimately, our results suggest that without policy-mandated human oversight, the deployment of generative AI threatens to degrade the very healthcare data ecosystems it relies upon."}

However, the performance of a RAG system is not determined by a single component but emerges from a complex interplay of modular choices, such as embedding models and retrieval algorithms. This creates a vast and often opaque configuration space, making it challenging for developers to understand performance trade-offs and identify optimal designs. To address this challenge, we present RAGExplorer, a visual analytics system for the systematic comparison and diagnosis of RAG configurations. RAGExplorer guides users through a seamless macro-to-micro analytical workflow. Initially, it empowers developers to survey the performance landscape across numerous configurations, allowing for a high-level understanding of which design choices are most effective. For a deeper analysis, the system enables users to drill down into individual failure cases, investigate how differences in retrieved information contribute to errors, and interactively test hypotheses by manipulating the provided context to observe the resulting impact on the generated answer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RAGExplorer through detailed case studies and user studies, validating its ability to empower developers in navigating the complex RAG design space.

KOCO-BENCH contains 6 emerging domains with 11 software frameworks and 25 projects, featuring curated knowledge corpora alongside multi-granularity evaluation tasks including domain code generation (from function-level to project-level with rigorous test suites) and domain knowledge understanding (via multiple-choice Q&A).

As AI agents increasingly collaborate on complex work, they must develop coordination capabilities to function as effective teammates. Yet we hypothesize that current agents lack these capabilities. To test this, we introduce CooperBench, a benchmark of over 600 collaborative coding tasks across 12 libraries in 4 programming languages. Each task assigns two agents different features that can be implemented independently but may conflict without proper coordination. Tasks are grounded in real open-source repositories with expert-written tests. Evaluating state-of-the-art coding agents, we observe the curse of coordination: agents achieve on average 30% lower success rates when working together compared to performing both tasks individually. This contrasts sharply with human teams, where adding teammates typically improves productivity. Our analysis reveals three key issues: (1) communication channels become jammed with vague, ill-timed, and inaccurate messages; (2) even with effective communication, agents deviate from their commitments; and (3) agents often hold incorrect expectations about others' plans and communication. Through large-scale simulation, we also observe rare but interesting emergent coordination behavior including role division, resource division, and negotiation. Our research presents a novel benchmark for collaborative coding and calls for a shift from pursuing individual agent capability to developing social intelligence."}

To resolve this dilemma, we propose Search-and-Replace Infilling (SRI), a framework that internalizes the agentic verification-and-editing mechanism into a unified, single-pass inference process. By structurally grounding edits via an explicit search phase, SRI harmonizes completion tasks with the instruction-following priors of Chat LLMs, extending the paradigm from static infilling to dynamic context-aware editing. We synthesize a high-quality dataset, SRI-200K, and fine-tune the SRI-Coder series. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that with minimal data (20k samples), SRI-Coder enables Chat models to surpass the completion performance of their Base counterparts. Crucially, unlike FIM-style tuning, SRI preserves general coding competencies and maintains inference latency comparable to standard FIM. We empower the entire Qwen3-Coder series with SRI, encouraging the developer community to leverage this framework for advanced auto-completion and assisted development."}

Since the requested prompts cannot be used to directly cause harm, they are not refused by frontier model safeguards. We evaluate these elicitation attacks within the domain of hazardous chemical synthesis and processing, and demonstrate that our attacks recover approximately 40% of the capability gap between the base open-source model and an unrestricted frontier model. We then show that the efficacy of elicitation attacks scales with the capability of the frontier model and the amount of generated fine-tuning data.

We then create a Mafia Detector using GPT-4-Turbo to analyze game transcripts without player role information to predict the mafia players. We use prediction accuracy as a surrogate marker for deception quality. We compare this prediction accuracy to that of 28 human games and a random baseline. Results show that the Mafia Detector's mafia prediction accuracy is lower on LLM games than on human games. The result is consistent regardless of the game days and the number of mafias detected.

Current methods for shaping LRM behavior typically rely on reinforcement learning or fine-tuning with gold-standard reasoning traces, a paradigm that is both computationally expensive and difficult to scale. In this paper, we reveal that LRMs possess latent \\textit{reasoning beliefs} that internally track their own reasoning traits, which can be captured through simple logit probing. Building upon this insight, we propose Reasoning Belief Engineering (RELIEF), a simple yet effective framework that shapes LRM behavior by aligning the model's self-concept with a target belief blueprint. Crucially, RELIEF completely bypasses the need for reasoning-trace supervision. It internalizes desired traits by fine-tuning on synthesized, self-reflective question-answering pairs that affirm the target belief. Extensive experiments on efficiency and faithfulness tasks demonstrate that RELIEF matches or outperforms behavior-supervised and preference-based baselines while requiring lower training costs. Further analysis validates that shifting a model's reasoning belief effectively shapes its actual behavior."}

However, existing self-play frameworks often suffer from optimization instability, due to (i) non-stationary objectives induced by solver-dependent reward feedback for the Questioner, and (ii) bootstrapping errors from self-generated pseudo-labels used to supervise the Solver. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce DARC (Decoupled Asymmetric Reasoning Curriculum), a two-stage framework that stabilizes the self-evolution process. First, we train the Questioner to synthesize difficulty-calibrated questions, conditioned on explicit difficulty levels and external corpora. Second, we train the Solver with an asymmetric self-distillation mechanism, where a document-augmented teacher generates high-quality pseudo-labels to supervise the student Solver that lacks document access. Empirical results demonstrate that DARC is model-agnostic, yielding an average improvement of 10.9 points across nine reasoning benchmarks and three backbone models. Moreover, DARC consistently outperforms all baselines and approaches the performance of fully supervised models without relying on human annotations.The code is available at https://github.com/RUCBM/DARC."}

Unlike most existing approaches that primarily test inner lookahead knowledge via Q\\\\&A, our benchmark evaluates model behavior in practical scenarios. To distinguish genuine predictive capability from memorization-based performance, we analyze performance decay across temporally distinct market regimes, incorporating several quantitative baselines to establish performance thresholds. We evaluate prominent open-source LLMs -- Llama 3.1 (8B and 70B) and DeepSeek 3.2 -- against a family of Point-in-Time LLMs (Pitinf-Small, Pitinf-Medium, and frontier-level model Pitinf-Large) from PiT-Inference. Results reveal significant lookahead bias in standard LLMs, as measured with alpha decay, unlike Pitinf models, which demonstrate improved generalization and reasoning abilities as they scale in size. This work establishes a foundation for the standardized evaluation of temporal bias in financial LLMs and provides a practical framework for identifying models suitable for real-world deployment.

Current efforts to mitigate this via token compression often fail by blindly applying text-centric metrics to multimodal contexts. We identify a critical failure mode termed Visual Amnesia, where linguistically redundant tokens are erroneously pruned, leading to hallucinations. To address this, we introduce V-Skip that reformulates token pruning as a Visual-Anchored Information Bottleneck (VA-IB) optimization problem. V-Skip employs a dual-path gating mechanism that weighs token importance through both linguistic surprisal and cross-modal attention flow, effectively rescuing visually salient anchors. Extensive experiments on Qwen2-VL and Llama-3.2 families demonstrate that V-Skip achieves a $2.9\\times$ speedup with negligible accuracy loss. Specifically, it preserves fine-grained visual details, outperforming other baselines over 30\\% on the DocVQA."}

Visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks are required to evaluate how models interpret dermatological images, reason over fine-grained morphology, and generate clinically meaningful descriptions. We introduce DermaBench, a clinician-annotated dermatology VQA benchmark built on the Diverse Dermatology Images (DDI) dataset. DermaBench comprises 656 clinical images from 570 unique patients spanning Fitzpatrick skin types I-VI. Using a hierarchical annotation schema with 22 main questions (single-choice, multi-choice, and open-ended), expert dermatologists annotated each image for diagnosis, anatomic site, lesion morphology, distribution, surface features, color, and image quality, together with open-ended narrative descriptions and summaries, yielding approximately 14.474 VQA-style annotations.

We study this problem by introducing MIR-SafetyBench, the first benchmark focused on multi-image reasoning safety, which consists of 2,676 instances across a taxonomy of 9 multi-image relations. Our extensive evaluations on 19 MLLMs reveal a troubling trend: models with more advanced multi-image reasoning can be more vulnerable on MIR-SafetyBench. Beyond attack success rates, we find that many responses labeled as safe are superficial, often driven by misunderstanding or evasive, non-committal replies. We further observe that unsafe generations exhibit lower attention entropy than safe ones on average. This internal signature suggests a possible risk that models may over-focus on task solving while neglecting safety constraints.

We argue that incorrect predictions arise when small errors in the attention mechanism accumulate to cross a threshold, and use this insight to derive a quantitative two-parameter relationship between the accuracy and the complexity of the task. The two parameters vary with the prompt and the model; they can be interpreted in terms of an elementary noise rate, and the number of plausible erroneous tokens that can be predicted. Our analysis is inspired by an ``effective field theory'' perspective: the LLM's many raw parameters can be reorganized into just two parameters that govern the error rate. We perform extensive empirical tests, using Gemini 2.5 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Pro and DeepSeek R1, and find excellent agreement between the predicted and observed accuracy for a variety of tasks, although we also identify deviations in some cases. Our model provides an alternative to suggestions that errors made by LLMs on long repetitive tasks indicate the ``collapse of reasoning'', or an inability to express ``compositional'' functions. Finally, we show how to construct prompts to reduce the error rate."}

While the effectiveness of agents has continued to improve, efficiency, which is crucial for real-world deployment, has often been overlooked. This paper therefore investigates efficiency from three core components of agents: memory, tool learning, and planning, considering costs such as latency, tokens, steps, etc. Aimed at conducting comprehensive research addressing the efficiency of the agentic system itself, we review a broad range of recent approaches that differ in implementation yet frequently converge on shared high-level principles including but not limited to bounding context via compression and management, designing reinforcement learning rewards to minimize tool invocation, and employing controlled search mechanisms to enhance efficiency, which we discuss in detail. Accordingly, we characterize efficiency in two complementary ways: comparing effectiveness under a fixed cost budget, and comparing cost at a comparable level of effectiveness. This trade-off can also be viewed through the Pareto frontier between effectiveness and cost. From this perspective, we also examine efficiency oriented benchmarks by summarizing evaluation protocols for these components and consolidating commonly reported efficiency metrics from both benchmark and methodological studies. Moreover, we discuss the key challenges and future directions, with the goal of providing promising insights."}

Yang", "Hao Bai", "Ian Wu", "Gene Yang", "Amrith Setlur", "Aviral Kumar"], "title": "InT: Self-Proposed Interventions Enable Credit Assignment in LLM Reasoning", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "comment": null, "summary": "Outcome-reward reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective at improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, standard RL assigns credit only at the level of the final answer, penalizing entire reasoning traces when the outcome is incorrect and uniformly reinforcing all steps when it is correct. As a result, correct intermediate steps may be discouraged in failed traces, while spurious steps may be reinforced in successful ones. We refer to this failure mode as the problem of credit assignment. While a natural remedy is to train a process reward model, accurately optimizing such models to identify corrective reasoning steps remains challenging. We introduce Intervention Training (InT), a training paradigm in which the model performs fine-grained credit assignment on its own reasoning traces by proposing short, targeted corrections that steer trajectories toward higher reward. Using reference solutions commonly available in mathematical reasoning datasets and exploiting the fact that verifying a model-generated solution is easier than generating a correct one from scratch, the model identifies the first error in its reasoning and proposes a single-step intervention to redirect the trajectory toward the correct solution. We then apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to the on-policy rollout up to the point of error concatenated with the intervention, localizing error to the specific step that caused failure. We show that the resulting model serves as a far better initialization for RL training. After running InT and subsequent fine-tuning with RL, we improve accuracy by nearly 14% over a 4B-parameter base model on IMO-AnswerBench, outperforming larger open-source models such as gpt-oss-20b."}

This model has two key components: a common structure designed to be as large as possible and a parametric structure intended to be as small as possible. Each heuristic is obtained by instantiating the parametric part in a different way. Particular instances for Genetic Algorithms (GA), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) are presented. Then, we use our model to prove the Turing-completeness of SLS algorithms in general. The proof uses our framework to construct a GA able to simulate any Turing machine. This Turing-completeness implies that determining any non-trivial property concerning the relationship between the inputs and the computed outputs is undecidable for GA and, by extension, for the general set of SLS methods (although not necessarily for each particular method). Similar proofs are more informally presented for PSO and ACO."}

However, existing RL training pipelines are computationally inefficient and resource-intensive, with the rollout phase accounting for over 70% of total training time. Quantized RL training, particularly using FP8 precision, offers a promising approach to mitigating this bottleneck. A commonly adopted strategy applies FP8 precision during rollout while retaining BF16 precision for training. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of FP8 RL training and demonstrate that the widely used BF16-training + FP8-rollout strategy suffers from severe training instability and catastrophic accuracy collapse under long-horizon rollouts and challenging tasks. Our analysis shows that these failures stem from the off-policy nature of the approach, which introduces substantial numerical mismatch between training and inference. Motivated by these observations, we propose Jet-RL, an FP8 RL training framework that enables robust and stable RL optimization. The key idea is to adopt a unified FP8 precision flow for both training and rollout, thereby minimizing numerical discrepancies and eliminating the need for inefficient inter-step calibration. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Jet-RL: our method achieves up to 33% speedup in the rollout phase, up to 41% speedup in the training phase, and a 16% end-to-end speedup over BF16 training, while maintaining stable convergence across all settings and incurring negligible accuracy degradation."}
