To verify a\nclaim, current approaches majorly follow one of two strategies i.e. (i) relying\non embedded knowledge of language models, and (ii) fine-tuning them with\nevidence pieces. While the former can make systems to hallucinate, the later\nhave not been very successful till date. The primary reason behind this is that\nfact verification is a complex process. Language models have to parse through\nmultiple pieces of evidence before making a prediction. Further, the evidence\npieces often contradict each other. This makes the reasoning process even more\ncomplex. We proposed a simple yet effective approach where we relied on\nentailment and the generative ability of language models to produce\n''supporting'' and ''refuting'' justifications (for the truthfulness of a\nclaim). We trained language models based on these justifications and achieved\nsuperior results. Apart from that, we did a systematic comparison of different\nprompting and fine-tuning strategies, as it is currently lacking in the\nliterature. Some of our observations are: (i) training language models with raw\nevidence sentences registered an improvement up to 8.20% in macro-F1, over the\nbest performing baseline for the RAW-FC dataset, (ii) similarly, training\nlanguage models with prompted claim-evidence understanding (TBE-2) registered\nan improvement (with a margin up to 16.39%) over the baselines for the same\ndataset, (iii) training language models with entailed justifications (TBE-3)\noutperformed the baselines by a huge margin (up to 28.57% and 44.26% for\nLIAR-RAW and RAW-FC, respectively).

To facilitate this refined task, we introduce several modelling\napproaches, including supervised deep learning models and large language\nmodels. Our experiments show that, under this redefined task, state-of-the-art\nLLMs outperform both supervised models and human supporters. Notably, contrary\nto some earlier findings, we observe that LLMs frequently ask questions and\nprovide suggestions, demonstrating more holistic support capabilities."}

However, these extended outputs often exhibit\nsubstantial redundancy, which limits the efficiency of LRMs. In this paper, we\ninvestigate RL-based approaches to promote reasoning efficiency. Specifically,\nwe first present a unified framework that formulates various efficient\nreasoning methods through the lens of length-based reward shaping. Building on\nthis perspective, we propose a novel Length-bAsed StEp Reward shaping method\n(LASER), which employs a step function as the reward, controlled by a target\nlength. LASER surpasses previous methods, achieving a superior Pareto-optimal\nbalance between performance and efficiency. Next, we further extend LASER based\non two key intuitions: (1) The reasoning behavior of the model evolves during\ntraining, necessitating reward specifications that are also adaptive and\ndynamic; (2) Rather than uniformly encouraging shorter or longer chains of\nthought (CoT), we posit that length-based reward shaping should be\ndifficulty-aware i.e., it should penalize lengthy CoTs more for easy queries.\nThis approach is expected to facilitate a combination of fast and slow\nthinking, leading to a better overall tradeoff. The resulting method is termed\nLASER-D (Dynamic and Difficulty-aware). Experiments on\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, and\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B show that our approach significantly enhances both\nreasoning performance and response length efficiency.

Such designs are susceptible to reward hacking\nand generalize poorly beyond their training distributions. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose Tango, a novel framework that uses RL to concurrently\ntrain both an LLM generator and a verifier in an interleaved manner.

Such a situation occurs in the attention\nmechanism of the transformer architecture.

At the same time, most attention weights become very\nsmall, as most attention heads tend to connect a given token with only a small\nfraction of other tokens in the sequence. These weights become promising\ntargets for cutting backpropagation. We propose a simple probabilistic rule\ncontrolled by a single parameter $c$ that cuts backpropagation through most\nattention weights, leaving at most $c$ interactions per token per attention\nhead. This brings a factor of $c/n$ reduction in the compute required for the\nattention backpropagation, turning it from quadratic $O(n^2)$ to linear\ncomplexity $O(nc)$. We have empirically verified that, for a typical\ntransformer model, cutting $99\\%$ of the attention gradient flow (i.e. choosing\n$c \\sim 20-30$) results in relative gradient variance increase of only about\n$1\\%$ for $n \\sim 2000$, and it decreases with $n$.

We identify key opportunities where EC can enhance LLM training,\nfine-tuning, prompt engineering, and architecture search, while LLMs can, in\nturn, aid in automating the design, analysis, and interpretation of ECs. The\nmanuscript explores the synergistic integration of EC and LLMs, highlighting\ntheir bidirectional contributions to advancing artificial intelligence. It\nfirst examines how EC techniques enhance LLMs by optimizing key components such\nas prompt engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and architecture search,\ndemonstrating how evolutionary methods automate and refine these processes.\nSecondly, the survey investigates how LLMs improve EC by automating\nmetaheuristic design, tuning evolutionary algorithms, and generating adaptive\nheuristics, thereby increasing efficiency and scalability. Emerging\nco-evolutionary frameworks are discussed, showcasing applications across\ndiverse fields while acknowledging challenges like computational costs,\ninterpretability, and algorithmic convergence. The survey concludes by\nidentifying open research questions and advocating for hybrid approaches that\ncombine the strengths of EC and LLMs."}

Such threats have raised critical concerns\nabout the safety and reliability of LLMs in real-world deployment. While\nexisting defense mechanisms partially mitigate such risks, subsequent\nadvancements in adversarial techniques have enabled novel jailbreaking methods\nto circumvent these protections, exposing the limitations of static defense\nframeworks. In this work, we explore defending against evolving jailbreaking\nthreats through the lens of context retrieval. First, we conduct a preliminary\nstudy demonstrating that even a minimal set of safety-aligned examples against\na particular jailbreak can significantly enhance robustness against this attack\npattern. Building on this insight, we further leverage the retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) techniques and propose Safety Context Retrieval (SCR), a\nscalable and robust safeguarding paradigm for LLMs against jailbreaking. Our\ncomprehensive experiments demonstrate how SCR achieves superior defensive\nperformance against both established and emerging jailbreaking tactics,\ncontributing a new paradigm to LLM safety. Our code will be available upon\npublication."}

This paper presents MIKU-PAL, a fully automated\nmultimodal pipeline for extracting high-consistency emotional speech from\nunlabeled video data. Leveraging face detection and tracking algorithms, we\ndeveloped an automatic emotion analysis system using a multimodal large\nlanguage model (MLLM). Our results demonstrate that MIKU-PAL can achieve\nhuman-level accuracy (68.5% on MELD) and superior consistency (0.93 Fleiss\nkappa score) while being much cheaper and faster than human annotation. With\nthe high-quality, flexible, and consistent annotation from MIKU-PAL, we can\nannotate fine-grained speech emotion categories of up to 26 types, validated by\nhuman annotators with 83% rationality ratings. Based on our proposed system, we\nfurther released a fine-grained emotional speech dataset MIKU-EmoBench(131.2\nhours) as a new benchmark for emotional text-to-speech and visual voice\ncloning."}

The lack of annotated datasets that\ncapture the unique prosodic cues and culturally specific expressions in\nMandarin leaves spoken toxicity underexplored. To address this, we introduce\nToxicTone -- the largest public dataset of its kind -- featuring detailed\nannotations that distinguish both forms of toxicity (e.g., profanity, bullying)\nand sources of toxicity (e.g., anger, sarcasm, dismissiveness). Our data,\nsourced from diverse real-world audio and organized into 13 topical categories,\nmirrors authentic communication scenarios. We also propose a multimodal\ndetection framework that integrates acoustic, linguistic, and emotional\nfeatures using state-of-the-art speech and emotion encoders. Extensive\nexperiments show our approach outperforms text-only and baseline models,\nunderscoring the essential role of speech-specific cues in revealing hidden\ntoxic expressions."}

While significant\nprogress has been made in understanding LLM behaviors, existing theoretical\nframeworks remain fragmented in explaining emergent phenomena through a unified\nmathematical lens. We establish the first formal connection between LLM\narchitectures and Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT) by proving two\nfundamental results: (1) the training process computationally approximates\nSolomonoff prior through loss minimization interpreted as program length\noptimization, and (2) next-token prediction implements approximate Solomonoff\ninduction. We leverage AIT to provide a unified theoretical explanation for\nin-context learning, few-shot learning, and scaling laws. Furthermore, our\ntheoretical insights lead to a principled method for few-shot example selection\nthat prioritizes samples where models exhibit lower predictive confidence. We\ndemonstrate through experiments on diverse text classification benchmarks that\nthis strategy yields significant performance improvements, particularly for\nsmaller model architectures, when compared to selecting high-confidence\nexamples. Our framework bridges the gap between theoretical foundations and\npractical LLM behaviors, providing both explanatory power and actionable\ninsights for future model development."}
