However, directly applying\nexisting methods to long-CoT LLMs causes significant performance degradation\ndue to the following two reasons: (1) Large cumulative error: Existing methods\nfail to adequately leverage available memory, and they directly quantize the KV\nCache during each decoding step, leading to large cumulative quantization\nerror. (2) Short-context calibration: Due to Rotary Positional Embedding\n(RoPE), the use of short-context data during calibration fails to account for\nthe distribution of less frequent channels in the Key Cache, resulting in\nperformance loss. We propose Progressive Mixed-Precision KV Cache Quantization\n(PM-KVQ) for long-CoT LLMs to address the above issues in two folds: (1) To\nreduce cumulative error, we design a progressive quantization strategy to\ngradually lower the bit-width of KV Cache in each block. Then, we propose\nblock-wise memory allocation to assign a higher bit-width to more sensitive\ntransformer blocks. (2) To increase the calibration length without additional\noverhead, we propose a new calibration strategy with positional interpolation\nthat leverages short calibration data with positional interpolation to\napproximate the data distribution of long-context data. Extensive experiments\non 7B-70B long-CoT LLMs show that PM-KVQ improves reasoning benchmark\nperformance by up to 8% over SOTA baselines under the same memory budget.

Existing methods train\nthe SLM to learn the long rationale in one iteration, resulting in two issues:\n1) Long rationales lead to a large token-level batch size during training,\nmaking gradients of core reasoning tokens (i.e., the token will directly affect\nthe correctness of subsequent reasoning) over-smoothed as they contribute a\ntiny fraction of the rationale. As a result, the SLM converges to sharp minima\nwhere it fails to grasp the reasoning logic. 2) The response is slow, as the\nSLM must generate a long rationale before reaching the answer. Therefore, we\npropose chunk-wise training (CWT), which uses a heuristic search to divide the\nrationale into internal semantically coherent chunks and focuses SLM on\nlearning from only one chunk per iteration. In this way, CWT naturally isolates\nnon-reasoning chunks that do not involve the core reasoning token (e.g.,\nsummary and transitional chunks) from the SLM learning for reasoning chunks,\nmaking the fraction of the core reasoning token increase in the corresponding\niteration.

Final version before journal publication", "summary": "In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot optimization with HED-LM (Hybrid\nEuclidean Distance with Large Language Models) to improve example selection for\nsensor-based classification tasks. While few-shot prompting enables efficient\ninference with limited labeled data, its performance largely depends on the\nquality of selected examples. HED-LM addresses this challenge through a hybrid\nselection pipeline that filters candidate examples based on Euclidean distance\nand re-ranks them using contextual relevance scored by large language models\n(LLMs). To validate its effectiveness, we apply HED-LM to a fatigue detection\ntask using accelerometer data characterized by overlapping patterns and high\ninter-subject variability. Unlike simpler tasks such as activity recognition,\nfatigue detection demands more nuanced example selection due to subtle\ndifferences in physiological signals. Our experiments show that HED-LM achieves\na mean macro F1-score of 69.13$\\pm$10.71%, outperforming both random selection\n(59.30$\\pm$10.13%) and distance-only filtering (67.61$\\pm$11.39%). These\nrepresent relative improvements of 16.6% and 2.3%, respectively. The results\nconfirm that combining numerical similarity with contextual relevance improves\nthe robustness of few-shot prompting. Overall, HED-LM offers a practical\nsolution to improve performance in real-world sensor-based learning tasks and\nshows potential for broader applications in healthcare monitoring, human\nactivity recognition, and industrial safety scenarios."}

While existing\napproaches demonstrate effectiveness in integrating new knowledge and\npreserving the original capabilities of LLMs, they fail to maintain\nfine-grained irrelevant knowledge facts that share the same subject as edited\nknowledge but differ in relation and object. This challenge arises because\nsubject representations inherently encode multiple attributes, causing the\ntarget and fine-grained irrelevant knowledge to become entangled in the\nrepresentation space, and thus vulnerable to unintended alterations during\nediting. To address this, we propose DiKE, a novel approach that Disentangles\nKnowledge representations for LLM Editing (DiKE). DiKE consists of two key\ncomponents: a Knowledge Representation Disentanglement (KRD) module that\ndecomposes the subject representation into target-knowledgerelated and\n-unrelated components, and a Disentanglement-based Knowledge Edit (DKE) module\nthat updates only the target-related component while explicitly preserving the\nunrelated one.

To\nrigorously evaluate fine-grained irrelevant knowledge preservation, we\nconstruct FINE-KED, a new benchmark comprising fine-grained irrelevant\nknowledge at different levels of relational similarity to the edited knowledge.\nExtensive experiments across multiple LLMs demonstrate that DiKE substantially\nimproves fine-grained irrelevant knowledge preservation while maintaining\ncompetitive general editing performance."}

In this\npaper, we propose System-1.5 Reasoning, an adaptive reasoning framework that\ndynamically allocates computation across reasoning steps through shortcut paths\nin latent space.Specifically, System-1.5 Reasoning introduces two types of\ndynamic shortcuts. The model depth shortcut (DS) adaptively reasons along the\nvertical depth by early exiting non-critical tokens through lightweight adapter\nbranches, while allowing critical tokens to continue through deeper Transformer\nlayers. The step shortcut (SS) reuses hidden states across the decoding steps\nto skip trivial steps and reason horizontally in latent space.

In the\nparallel hybrid architecture, the transformer operates independently in\nparallel with the SSM, and these pairs are cascaded, with output from one pair\nforming the input to the next. Two issues are (i) creating an expressive\nknowledge representation with the inherently divergent outputs from these\nseparate branches, and (ii) load balancing the computation between these\nparallel branches, while maintaining representation fidelity. In this work we\npresent FlowHN, a novel parallel hybrid network architecture that accommodates\nvarious strategies for load balancing, achieved through appropriate\ndistribution of input tokens between the two branches. Two innovative\ndifferentiating factors in FlowHN include a FLOP aware dynamic token split\nbetween the attention and SSM branches yielding efficient balance in compute\nload, and secondly, a method to fuse the highly divergent outputs from\nindividual branches for enhancing representation expressivity.

While various methods exist for fusing these modalities, there\nis no standard metric to evaluate alignment quality in LLMs. In this work, we\npropose a new metric, ALAS (Automatic Latent Alignment Score). Our study\nexamines the correlation between audio and text representations across\ntransformer layers, for two different tasks (Spoken Question Answering and\nEmotion Recognition). We showcase that our metric behaves as expected across\ndifferent layers and different tasks."}

Recent efforts have focused on optimizing\nreasoning efficiency by shortening the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning\nprocesses through various approaches, such as length-aware prompt engineering,\nsupervised fine-tuning on CoT data with variable lengths, and reinforcement\nlearning with length penalties. Although these methods effectively reduce\nreasoning length, they still necessitate an initial reasoning phase. More\nrecent approaches have attempted to integrate long-chain and short-chain\nreasoning abilities into a single model, yet they still rely on manual control\nto toggle between short and long CoT.In this work, we propose a novel approach\nthat autonomously switches between short and long reasoning chains based on\nproblem complexity. Our method begins with supervised fine-tuning of the base\nmodel to equip both long-chain and short-chain reasoning abilities. We then\nemploy reinforcement learning to further balance short and long CoT generation\nwhile maintaining accuracy through two key strategies: first, integrating\nreinforcement learning with a long-short adaptive group-wise reward strategy to\nassess prompt complexity and provide corresponding rewards; second,\nimplementing a logit-based reasoning mode switching loss to optimize the\nmodel's initial token choice, thereby guiding the selection of the reasoning\ntype.Evaluations on mathematical datasets demonstrate that our model can\ndynamically switch between long-chain and short-chain reasoning modes without\nsubstantially sacrificing performance.

VisRet\nalso significantly benefits downstream visual question answering accuracy when\nused in retrieval-augmented generation pipelines. The method is plug-and-play\nand compatible with off-the-shelf retrievers, making it an effective module for\nknowledge-intensive multi-modal systems. Our code and the new benchmark are\npublicly available at https://github.com/xiaowu0162/Visualize-then-Retrieve."}

This paper explores how\nto effectively address this issue. Our key motivation is that as more tokens\nare generated during the autoregressive process, subsequent tokens follow more\nconstrained distributions and are easier to sample. To intuitively explain, if\na model has generated part of a dog, the remaining tokens must complete the dog\nand thus are more constrained. Empirical evidence supports our motivation: at\nlater generation stages, the next tokens can be well predicted by a multilayer\nperceptron, exhibit low variance, and follow closer-to-straight-line denoising\npaths from noise to tokens. Based on our finding, we introduce diffusion step\nannealing (DiSA), a training-free method which gradually uses fewer diffusion\nsteps as more tokens are generated, e.g., using 50 steps at the beginning and\ngradually decreasing to 5 steps at later stages. Because DiSA is derived from\nour finding specific to diffusion in autoregressive models, it is complementary\nto existing acceleration methods designed for diffusion alone. DiSA can be\nimplemented in only a few lines of code on existing models, and albeit simple,\nachieves $5-10\\times$ faster inference for MAR and Harmon and $1.4-2.5\\times$\nfor FlowAR and xAR, while maintaining the generation quality."}
