Activation steering provides an alternative for\ninference-time control, but existing methods typically lack fine-grained,\nadaptive mechanisms. We introduce a novel approach using a lightweight,\ntrainable controller network integrated during inference. This controller\nnetwork observes specific intermediate LLM activations and predicts both a\nglobal scaling factor and layer-specific weights. The predicted global scaling\nfactor and layer-specific weights then dynamically modulate the intensity of a\nsteering patch, derived from a pre-computed \"refusal direction\" vector, applied\nacross the LLM's layers during generation. Trained on activations from both\nharmful and benign prompts, our controller learns to discriminatively apply\nnuanced, layer-aware interventions, activating steering primarily for harmful\ninputs. Experiments using safety benchmarks like ToxicChat & In-The-Wild\nJailbreak Prompts demonstrate that our weighted steering controller\nsignificantly increases refusal rates compared to the base LLM, achieving\ntargeted behavioral modification without altering the original model\nparameters.

On four challenging datasets, Amulet shows that (a) humans\nfrequently (60 to 70 percent of the time) change their intents from one turn of\nthe conversation to the next, and (b) in 75 percent of instances, the\npreference responses can be differentiated via dialog acts and/or maxims,\nreiterating the latter's significance in judging such data.

Content analysis of\nposts and replies in online conversations is difficult because each individual\nutterance is usually short and may implicitly refer to other posts within the\nsame conversation. Thus, understanding individual posts requires capturing the\nconversational context and dependencies between different parts of a\nconversation tree and then encoding the context dependencies between posts and\ncomments/replies into the language model.\n  To this end, we propose a general-purpose mechanism to discover appropriate\nconversational context for various aspects about an online post in a\nconversation, such as whether it is informative, insightful, interesting or\nfunny. Specifically, we design two families of Conversation Kernels, which\nexplore different parts of the neighborhood of a post in the tree representing\nthe conversation and through this, build relevant conversational context that\nis appropriate for each task being considered. We apply our developed method to\nconversations crawled from slashdot.org, which allows users to apply highly\ndifferent labels to posts, such as 'insightful', 'funny', etc., and therefore\nprovides an ideal experimental platform to study whether a framework such as\nConversation Kernels is general-purpose and flexible enough to be adapted to\ndisparately different conversation understanding tasks."}

Despite the known fact that LLMs tend to hallucinate\nand generate factually incorrect text, they might also tend to choose to\ngenerate factual text that is indeed factually correct and yet less informative\nthan other, more informative choices. In this work, we tackle this problem by\nproposing an informativeness alignment mechanism.

In this paper, we\nintroduce a plug-in KGE method, Relation-Semantics Consistent Filter (RSCF),\ncontaining more consistent entity-transformation characterized by three\nfeatures: 1) shared affine transformation of relation embeddings across all\nrelations, 2) rooted entity-transformation that adds an entity embedding to its\nchange represented by the transformed vector, and 3) normalization of the\nchange to prevent scale reduction. To amplify the advantages of consistency\nthat preserve semantics on embeddings, RSCF adds relation transformation and\nprediction modules for enhancing the semantics. In knowledge graph completion\ntasks with distance-based and tensor decomposition models, RSCF significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art KGE methods, showing robustness across all\nrelations and their frequencies."}

To address these limitations, we propose MAMMQA, a\nmulti-agent QA framework for multimodal inputs spanning text, tables, and\nimages. Our system includes two Visual Language Model (VLM) agents and one\ntext-based Large Language Model (LLM) agent. The first VLM decomposes the user\nquery into sub-questions and sequentially retrieves partial answers from each\nmodality. The second VLM synthesizes and refines these results through\ncross-modal reasoning. Finally, the LLM integrates the insights into a cohesive\nanswer. This modular design enhances interpretability by making the reasoning\nprocess transparent and allows each agent to operate within its domain of\nexpertise.

First, there is a need for hierarchical\npersonalized representations for users. Previous approaches have typically used\nusers' search behavior as a single, overall representation, which proves\ninadequate in more nuanced generative scenarios. Additionally, query prefixes\nare typically short and may contain typos or sensitive information, increasing\nthe likelihood of generating toxic content compared to traditional text\ngeneration tasks. Such toxic content can degrade user experience and lead to\npublic relations issues. Therefore, the second critical challenge is\ndetoxifying QAC systems.\n  To address these two limitations, we propose a novel model (LaD) that\ncaptures personalized information from both long-term and short-term interests,\nincorporating adaptive detoxification. In LaD, personalized information is\ncaptured hierarchically at both coarse-grained and fine-grained levels. This\napproach preserves as much personalized information as possible while enabling\nonline generation within time constraints. To move a futher step, we propose an\nonline training method based on Reject Preference Optimization (RPO). By\nincorporating a special token [Reject] during both the training and inference\nprocesses, the model achieves adaptive detoxification. Consequently, the\ngenerated text presented to users is both non-toxic and relevant to the given\nprefix. We conduct comprehensive experiments on industrial-scale datasets and\nperform online A/B tests, delivering the largest single-experiment metric\nimprovement in nearly two years of our product. Our model has been deployed on\nKuaishou search, driving the primary traffic for hundreds of millions of active\nusers. The code is available at https://github.com/JXZe/LaD."}

Existing models struggle with complex\nBengali MWPs, largely because no human-annotated Bengali dataset has previously\naddressed this task. This gap has limited progress in Bengali mathematical\nreasoning. To address this, we created SOMADHAN, a dataset of 8792 complex\nBengali MWPs with manually written, step-by-step solutions. We designed this\ndataset to support reasoning-focused evaluation and model development in a\nlinguistically underrepresented context. Using SOMADHAN, we evaluated a range\nof large language models (LLMs) - including GPT-4o, GPT-3.5 Turbo, LLaMA series\nmodels, Deepseek, and Qwen - through both zero-shot and few-shot prompting with\nand without Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning. CoT prompting consistently\nimproved performance over standard prompting, especially in tasks requiring\nmulti-step logic. LLaMA-3.3 70B achieved the highest accuracy of 88% with\nfew-shot CoT prompting. We also applied Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune\nmodels efficiently, enabling them to adapt to Bengali MWPs with minimal\ncomputational cost.

CAAC employs a two-step approach: Visual-Token\nCalibration (VTC) to balance attention across visual tokens, and Adaptive\nAttention Re-Scaling (AAR) to reinforce visual grounding based on the model's\nconfidence. This confidence-driven adjustment ensures consistent visual\nalignment during generation. Experiments on CHAIR, AMBER, and POPE benchmarks\ndemonstrate that CAAC outperforms baselines, particularly in long-form\ngenerations, effectively reducing hallucination."}

We analyze\nthe interplay among arithmetic intensity, parallelization, and model quality\nand question whether current architectures fully exploit modern hardware. This\nwork redesigns attention to perform more computation per byte loaded from\nmemory to maximize hardware efficiency without trading off parallel\nscalability. We first propose Grouped-Tied Attention (GTA), a simple variant\nthat combines and reuses key and value states, reducing memory transfers\nwithout compromising model quality. We then introduce Grouped Latent Attention\n(GLA), a parallel-friendly latent attention paired with low-level optimizations\nfor fast decoding while maintaining high model quality. Experiments show that\nGTA matches Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) quality while using roughly half the\nKV cache and that GLA matches Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and is easier\nto shard. Our optimized GLA kernel is up to 2$\\times$ faster than FlashMLA, for\nexample, in a speculative decoding setting when the query length exceeds one.\nFurthermore, by fetching a smaller KV cache per device, GLA reduces end-to-end\nlatency and increases throughput in online serving benchmarks by up to\n2$\\times$."}

However,\nthis methodology is limited to tasks where rule-based answer verification is\npossible and does not naturally extend to real-world domains such as chemistry,\nhealthcare, engineering, law, biology, business, and economics. Current\npractical workarounds use an additional LLM as a model-based verifier; however,\nthis introduces issues such as reliance on a strong verifier LLM,\nsusceptibility to reward hacking, and the practical burden of maintaining the\nverifier model in memory during training. To address this and extend\nDeepSeek-R1-Zero-style training to general reasoning domains, we propose a\nverifier-free method (VeriFree) that bypasses answer verification and instead\nuses RL to directly maximize the probability of generating the reference\nanswer. We compare VeriFree with verifier-based methods and demonstrate that,\nin addition to its significant practical benefits and reduced compute\nrequirements, VeriFree matches and even surpasses verifier-based methods on\nextensive evaluations across MMLU-Pro, GPQA, SuperGPQA, and math-related\nbenchmarks. Moreover, we provide insights into this method from multiple\nperspectives: as an elegant integration of training both the policy and\nimplicit verifier in a unified model, and as a variational optimization\napproach.

To address this challenge, we introduce\nthe first benchmark and metric suite for poster generation, which pairs recent\nconference papers with author-designed posters and evaluates outputs on\n(i)Visual Quality-semantic alignment with human posters, (ii)Textual\nCoherence-language fluency, (iii)Holistic Assessment-six fine-grained aesthetic\nand informational criteria scored by a VLM-as-judge, and notably\n(iv)PaperQuiz-the poster's ability to convey core paper content as measured by\nVLMs answering generated quizzes. Building on this benchmark, we propose\nPosterAgent, a top-down, visual-in-the-loop multi-agent pipeline: the (a)Parser\ndistills the paper into a structured asset library; the (b)Planner aligns\ntext-visual pairs into a binary-tree layout that preserves reading order and\nspatial balance; and the (c)Painter-Commenter loop refines each panel by\nexecuting rendering code and using VLM feedback to eliminate overflow and\nensure alignment. In our comprehensive evaluation, we find that GPT-4o\noutputs-though visually appealing at first glance-often exhibit noisy text and\npoor PaperQuiz scores, and we find that reader engagement is the primary\naesthetic bottleneck, as human-designed posters rely largely on visual\nsemantics to convey meaning. Our fully open-source variants (e.g. based on the\nQwen-2.5 series) outperform existing 4o-driven multi-agent systems across\nnearly all metrics, while using 87% fewer tokens.
