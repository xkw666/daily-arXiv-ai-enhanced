Beyond facilitating basic selection, Reality\nProxy uses AI to enrich proxies with semantic attributes and hierarchical\nspatial relationships of their corresponding physical objects, enabling novel\nand previously cumbersome interactions in MR - such as skimming,\nattribute-based filtering, navigating nested groups, and complex multi object\nselections - all without requiring new gestures or menu systems. We demonstrate\nReality Proxy's versatility across diverse scenarios, including office\ninformation retrieval, large-scale spatial navigation, and multi-drone control.\nAn expert evaluation suggests the system's utility and usability, suggesting\nthat proxy-based abstractions offer a powerful and generalizable interaction\nparadigm for future MR systems."}

However, due to heterogeneous training data and model\narchitecture, the variant embedding models used in RAG exhibit different\nbenefits across various areas, often leading to different similarity\ncalculation results and, consequently, varying response quality from LLMs. To\naddress this problem, we propose and examine two approaches to enhance RAG by\ncombining the benefits of multiple embedding models, named Mixture-Embedding\nRAG and Confident RAG. Mixture-Embedding RAG simply sorts and selects\nretrievals from multiple embedding models based on standardized similarity;\nhowever, it does not outperform vanilla RAG.

To address\nthis gap, we introduce Efficiency Leverage (EL), a metric quantifying the\ncomputational advantage of an MoE model over a dense equivalent. We conduct a\nlarge-scale empirical study, training over 300 models up to 28B parameters, to\nsystematically investigate the relationship between MoE architectural\nconfigurations and EL.
