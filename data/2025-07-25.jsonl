However, the performance of such\napproaches remains inherently bounded by the reasoning capabilities of the\nmodel used to generate the rationales. In this paper, we introduce Shop-R1, a\nnovel reinforcement learning (RL) framework aimed at enhancing the reasoning\nability of LLMs for simulation of real human behavior in online shopping\nenvironments Specifically, Shop-R1 decomposes the human behavior simulation\ntask into two stages: rationale generation and action prediction, each guided\nby distinct reward signals. For rationale generation, we leverage internal\nmodel signals (e.g., logit distributions) to guide the reasoning process in a\nself-supervised manner. For action prediction, we propose a hierarchical reward\nstructure with difficulty-aware scaling to prevent reward hacking and enable\nfine-grained reward assignment. This design evaluates both high-level action\ntypes and the correctness of fine-grained sub-action details (attributes and\nvalues), rewarding outputs proportionally to their difficulty.

This paper introduces a novel\nframework that combines human expertise with Large Language Model (LLM)\nassistance to improve both annotation consistency and scalability. We propose a\nhierarchical taxonomy that organizes 14 fine-grained propaganda techniques into\nthree broader categories, conduct a human annotation study on the HQP dataset\nthat reveals low inter-annotator agreement for fine-grained labels, and\nimplement an LLM-assisted pre-annotation pipeline that extracts propagandistic\nspans, generates concise explanations, and assigns local labels as well as a\nglobal label. A secondary human verification study shows significant\nimprovements in both agreement and time-efficiency. Building on this, we\nfine-tune smaller language models (SLMs) to perform structured annotation.\nInstead of fine-tuning on human annotations, we train on high-quality\nLLM-generated data, allowing a large model to produce these annotations and a\nsmaller model to learn to generate them via knowledge distillation. Our work\ncontributes towards the development of scalable and robust propaganda detection\nsystems, supporting the idea of transparent and accountable media ecosystems in\nline with SDG 16.
