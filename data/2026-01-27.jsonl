While recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has advanced FVV due to its superior rendering speed, Streaming Free-Viewpoint Video (SFVV) introduces additional demands for rapid optimization, high-fidelity reconstruction under sparse constraints, and minimal storage footprints. To bridge this gap, we propose StreamLoD-GS, an LoD-based Gaussian Splatting framework designed specifically for SFVV. Our approach integrates three core innovations: 1) an Anchor- and Octree-based LoD-structured 3DGS with a hierarchical Gaussian dropout technique to ensure efficient and stable optimization while maintaining high-quality rendering; 2) a GMM-based motion partitioning mechanism that separates dynamic and static content, refining dynamic regions while preserving background stability; and 3) a quantized residual refinement framework that significantly reduces storage requirements without compromising visual fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StreamLoD-GS achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance in terms of quality, efficiency, and storage."}

The loss is constructed to control not only the mean ROI color but also the tail of the pixelwise error distribution through CVaR-style and soft-maximum penalties, with a late-start gate and a time-dependent schedule to stabilize guidance across denoising steps. We show that mean-only baselines can satisfy average color constraints while producing perceptually salient local failures, motivating our distribution-aware objective. The resulting method provides a practical, training-free mechanism for targeted color adherence that can be integrated into standard Stable Diffusion inpainting pipelines."}

While recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods achieve impressive real-time modeling performance, they rely on resource-unconstrained training assumptions that fail on mobile devices, which are limited by minute-scale training budgets and hardware-available peak-memory. We present PocketGS, a mobile scene modeling paradigm that enables on-device 3DGS training under these tightly coupled constraints while preserving high perceptual fidelity. Our method resolves the fundamental contradictions of standard 3DGS through three co-designed operators: G builds geometry-faithful point-cloud priors; I injects local surface statistics to seed anisotropic Gaussians, thereby reducing early conditioning gaps; and T unrolls alpha compositing with cached intermediates and index-mapped gradient scattering for stable mobile backpropagation. Collectively, these operators satisfy the competing requirements of training efficiency, memory compactness, and modeling fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PocketGS is able to outperform the powerful mainstream workstation 3DGS baseline to deliver high-quality reconstructions, enabling a fully on-device, practical capture-to-rendering workflow."}

These models can act as surrogates for volume data, enabling efficient storage and on-demand reconstruction via model predictions. However, conventional deterministic INRs only provide value predictions without insights into the model's prediction uncertainty or the impact of inherent noisiness in the data. This limitation can lead to unreliable data interpretation and visualization due to prediction inaccuracies in the reconstructed volume. Identifying erroneous results extracted from model-predicted data may be infeasible, as raw data may be unavailable due to its large size. To address this challenge, we introduce REV-INR, Regularized Evidential Implicit Neural Representation, which learns to predict data values accurately along with the associated coordinate-level data uncertainty and model uncertainty using only a single forward pass of the trained REV-INR during inference. By comprehensively comparing and contrasting REV-INR with existing well-established deep uncertainty estimation methods, we show that REV-INR achieves the best volume reconstruction quality with robust data (aleatoric) and model (epistemic) uncertainty estimates using the fastest inference time. Consequently, we demonstrate that REV-INR facilitates assessment of the reliability and trustworthiness of the extracted isosurfaces and volume visualization results, enabling analyses to be solely driven by model-predicted data."}

Unlike traditional generation tasks where all tokens are uniformly important, CoT emphasizes the final answer, rendering conventional KV compression strategies ineffective. In this paper, we present Crystal-KV, an efficient KV cache management framework tailored for CoT reasoning. Our key insight is the answer-first principle. By mapping answer preferences into think-stage attention map, we distinguish between SlipKV, which mainly maintains the reasoning flow but may occasionally introduce misleading context, and CrystalKV, which truly contributes to the correctness of the final answer. Next, we propose an attention-based Least Recently Frequently Used algorithm. It precisely identifies when a SlipKV entry's utility expires and evicts it, retaining CrystalKV without disrupting reasoning flow. Finally, we introduce an adaptive cache budget allocation algorithm. Based on the dynamic proportion of CrystalKV, it estimates the importance of each layer/head and adjusts the KV cache budget during inference, amplifying critical components to improve budget utilization. Results show that Crystal-KV achieves state-of-the-art KV cache compression, significantly improves throughput, and enables faster response time, while maintaining, or even improving, answer accuracy for CoT reasoning."}

Though advantages over traditional discretizations like spatial adaptivity and continuous differentiability of these spatial representations are leveraged by fluid solvers, solving the time-dependent PDEs that governs the fluid dynamics remain challenging, especially in incompressible fluids where the divergence-free constraint is enforced. In this paper, we propose a grid-free solver Dynamic Divergence-Free Kernels (DDFKs) for incompressible flows based on divergence-free kernels (DFKs). Each DFK is incorporated with a matrix-valued radial basis function and a vector-valued weight, yielding a divergence-free vector field. We model the continuous flow velocity as the sum of multiple DFKs, thus enforcing incompressibility while being able to preserve different level of details. Quantitative and qualitative results show that our method achieves comparable accuracy, robustness, ability to preserve vortices, time and memory efficiency and generality across diverse phenomena to state-of-the-art methods using memory-efficient spatial representations, while excels at maintaining incompressibility. Though our first-order solver are slower than fluid solvers with traditional discretizations, our approach exhibits significantly lower numerical dissipation due to reduced discretization error. We demonstrate our method on diverse incompressible flow examples with rich vortices and various solid boundary conditions."}

We introduce Pairwise Maximum Discrepancy Competition (PMDC), a dynamic and annotation-efficient framework for evaluating RM generalization using a large, unlabeled, open-domain prompt pool. PMDC actively selects prompt--response pairs that maximize disagreement between two RMs, yielding a compact set of highly contentious test cases. These cases are adjudicated by an oracle, and the resulting outcomes are aggregated via a Bradley--Terry model to produce a global ranking and pairwise win-rate landscape of RMs. We apply PMDC to re-evaluate 10 representative RMs and observe substantial rank reshuffling compared with conventional benchmarks. Qualitative analyses further uncover systematic generalization failures, providing valuable insights for improving reward modeling."}

However, generative modeling of B-Reps remains a formidable challenge due to their inherent heterogeneity as geometric cell complexes, which entangles topology with geometry across cells of varying orders (i.e., $k$-cells such as vertices, edges, faces). Previous methods typically rely on cascaded sequences to handle this hierarchy, which fails to fully exploit the geometric relationships between cells, such as adjacency and sharing, limiting context awareness and error recovery. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel paradigm that reformulates B-Reps into sets of compositional $k$-cell particles. Our approach encodes each topological entity as a composition of particles, where adjacent cells share identical latents at their interfaces, thereby promoting geometric coupling along shared boundaries. By decoupling the rigid hierarchy, our representation unifies vertices, edges, and faces, enabling the joint generation of topology and geometry with global context awareness.\n  We synthesize these particle sets using a multi-modal flow matching framework to handle unconditional generation as well as precise conditional tasks, such as 3D reconstruction from single-view or point cloud. Furthermore, the explicit and localized nature of our representation naturally extends to downstream tasks like local in-painting and enables the direct synthesis of non-manifold structures (e.g., wireframes). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method produces high-fidelity CAD models with superior validity and editability compared to state-of-the-art methods."}

These prediction sets are collections of full-sentence labelings that are guaranteed to contain the correct labeling with a user-specified confidence level. This approach serves a role analogous to confidence intervals in classical statistics by providing formal guarantees about the reliability of model predictions. Our method builds on conformal prediction, which offers finite-sample coverage guarantees under minimal assumptions. We design efficient nonconformity scoring functions to construct efficient, well-calibrated prediction sets that support both unconditional and class-conditional coverage. This framework accounts for heterogeneity across sentence length, language, entity type, and number of entities within a sentence. Empirical experiments on four NER models across three benchmark datasets demonstrate the broad applicability, validity, and efficiency of the proposed methods."}

We represent each panel using a signed distance field that defines its boundary and an unsigned distance field that identifies seam endpoints, and encode these fields into a continuous latent space that enables differentiable meshing. A latent flow matching model learns distributions over panel combinations in this representation, and a stitching prediction module recovers seam relations from extracted edge segments. This formulation allows accurate modeling and generation of sewing patterns with complex structures. We further show that it can be used to estimate sewing patterns from images with improved accuracy relative to existing approaches, and supports applications such as pattern completion and refitting, providing a practical tool for digital fashion design."}

These demands range from modeling contextual expectation violations to requiring external knowledge grounding or recognizing specific rhetorical patterns. To address this limitation, we introduce RAM-SD, a Retrieval-Augmented Multi-Agent framework for Sarcasm Detection. The framework operates through four stages: (1) contextual retrieval grounds the query in both sarcastic and non-sarcastic exemplars; (2) a meta-planner classifies the sarcasm type and selects an optimal reasoning plan from a predefined set; (3) an ensemble of specialized agents performs complementary, multi-view analysis; and (4) an integrator synthesizes these analyses into a final, interpretable judgment with a natural language explanation. Evaluated on four standard benchmarks, RAM-SD achieves a state-of-the-art Macro-F1 of 77.74%, outperforming the strong GPT-4o+CoC baseline by 7.01 points. Our framework not only sets a new performance benchmark but also provides transparent and interpretable reasoning traces, illuminating the cognitive processes behind sarcasm comprehension."}

In this work, we propose and address the challenging Multi-View S2V (MV-S2V) task, which synthesizes videos from multiple reference views to enforce 3D-level subject consistency. Regarding the scarcity of training data, we first develop a synthetic data curation pipeline to generate highly customized synthetic data, complemented by a small-scale real-world captured dataset to boost the training of MV-S2V.

In computational linguistics, fear is primarily studied as an emotion, but not as a distinct form of speech. Fear speech content is widespread and growing, and often outperforms hate-speech content in reach and engagement because it appears \"civiler\" and evades moderation. Yet the computational study of fear speech remains fragmented and under-resourced. This can be understood by recognizing that fear speech is a phenomenon shaped by contributions from multiple disciplines. In this paper, we bridge cross-disciplinary perspectives by comparing theories of fear from Psychology, Political science, Communication science, and Linguistics. Building on this, we review existing definitions. We follow up with a survey of datasets from related research areas and propose a taxonomy that consolidates different dimensions of fear for studying fear speech.

By interpreting sentences as trajectories in the hidden state space, we first show that on the balanced SNIPS dataset, the network learns an ideal solution: the state space, constrained to a low-dimensional manifold, is partitioned into distinct clusters corresponding to each intent. The application of this framework to the imbalanced ATIS dataset then reveals how this ideal geometric solution is distorted by class imbalance, causing the clusters for low-frequency intents to degrade. Our framework decouples geometric separation from readout alignment, providing a novel, mechanistic explanation for real world performance disparities. These findings provide new insights into RNN dynamics, offering a geometric interpretation of how dataset properties directly shape a network's computational solution."}

We introduce a controlled evaluation framework using three leading models -- GPT-4o, Llama-3.3, and Mistral-Large 2.1 -- across two generation settings: Standalone Generation, which isolates intrinsic demographic effects, and Context-Rich Generation, which incorporates thematic and regional context to emulate realistic targeting. We evaluate generated messages along three dimensions: lexical content, language style, and persuasive framing. We instantiate this framework on climate communication and find consistent age- and gender-based asymmetries across models: male- and youth-targeted messages emphasize agency, innovation, and assertiveness, while female- and senior-targeted messages stress warmth, care, and tradition. Contextual prompts systematically amplify these disparities, with persuasion scores significantly higher for messages tailored to younger or male audiences. Our findings demonstrate how demographic stereotypes can surface and intensify in LLM-generated targeted communication, underscoring the need for bias-aware generation pipelines and transparent auditing frameworks that explicitly account for demographic conditioning in socially sensitive applications."}

Consistent with prior work, we find that verb and pronoun forms are shaped by competing communicative pressures for simplicity (minimizing the inventory of grammatical distinctions) and accuracy (enabling recovery of intended meanings).

In multimodal settings, accompanying images can amplify or invert textual meaning, demanding models that reason across modalities and account for subjectivity. We propose a three-step framework for developing efficient multimodal reasoning models that can (i) interpret multimodal figurative language, (ii) provide transparent reasoning traces, and (iii) generalize across multiple figurative styles. Experiments across four styles show that (1) incorporating reasoning traces substantially improves multimodal figurative understanding, (2) reasoning learned in one style can transfer to others, especially between related styles like sarcasm and humor, and (3) training jointly across styles yields a generalized reasoning VLM that outperforms much larger open- and closed-source models.

Presented at the First Workshop on Gender Bias in Natural Language Processing (GeBNLP 2019)", "summary": "Modern models for common NLP tasks often employ machine learning techniques and train on journalistic, social media, or other culturally-derived text. These have recently been scrutinized for racial and gender biases, rooting from inherent bias in their training text. These biases are often sub-optimal and recent work poses methods to rectify them; however, these biases may shed light on actual racial or gender gaps in the culture(s) that produced the training text, thereby helping us understand cultural context through big data. This paper presents an approach for quantifying gender bias in word embeddings, and then using them to characterize statistical gender gaps in education, politics, economics, and health. We validate these metrics on 2018 Twitter data spanning 51 U.S. regions and 99 countries. We correlate state and country word embedding biases with 18 international and 5 U.S.-based statistical gender gaps, characterizing regularities and predictive strength."}

However, RAG is often challenged by reasoning-intensive question-answering (QA), since common retrieval methods like cosine similarity maximize relevance at the cost of introducing redundant content, which can reduce information recall. To address this, we introduce Diversity-Focused Retrieval-Augmented Generation (DF-RAG), which systematically incorporates diversity into the retrieval step to improve performance on complex, reasoning-intensive QA benchmarks. DF-RAG builds upon the Maximal Marginal Relevance framework to select information chunks that are both relevant to the query and maximally dissimilar from each other. A key innovation of DF-RAG is its ability to optimize the level of diversity for each query dynamically at test time without requiring any additional fine-tuning or prior information. We show that DF-RAG improves F1 performance on reasoning-intensive QA benchmarks by 4-10 percent over vanilla RAG using cosine similarity and also outperforms other established baselines. Furthermore, we estimate an Oracle ceiling of up to 18 percent absolute F1 gains over vanilla RAG, of which DF-RAG captures up to 91.3 percent."}

To address this gap, we introduce Verifiable Process Reward Models (VPRMs), a reinforcement-learning framework in which intermediate reasoning steps are checked by deterministic, rule-based verifiers. We apply VPRMs to risk-of-bias assessment for medical evidence synthesis, a domain where guideline-defined criteria and rule-based decision paths enable programmatic verification of reasoning traces. Across multiple datasets, we find that VPRMs generate reasoning that adheres closely to domain rules and achieve substantially higher coherence between step-level decisions and final labels. Results show that VPRMs achieve up to 20% higher F1 than state-of-the-art models and 6.5% higher than verifiable outcome rewards, with substantial gains in evidence grounding and logical coherence."}

We propose a novel, frame-guided methodology where algorithms programmatically select significant data points based on six semantic frames to generate realistic claims in English, Chinese, Spanish, and Hindi.

In this paper, we formalize this challenge by linking input ambiguity to aleatoric uncertainty (AU), which is the irreducible uncertainty arising from underspecified input. To facilitate research in this direction, we construct CV-MedBench, the first benchmark designed for studying input ambiguity in Medical QA. Using this benchmark, we analyze AU from a representation engineering perspective, revealing that AU is linearly encoded in LLM's internal activation patterns. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a novel AU-guided \"Clarify-Before-Answer\" framework, which incorporates AU-Probe - a lightweight module that detects input ambiguity directly from hidden states. Unlike existing uncertainty estimation methods, AU-Probe requires neither LLM fine-tuning nor multiple forward passes, enabling an efficient mechanism to proactively request user clarification and significantly enhance safety. Extensive experiments across four open LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our QA framework, with an average accuracy improvement of 9.48% over baselines. Our framework provides an efficient and robust solution for safe Medical QA, strengthening the reliability of health-related applications.

These limitations motivated the development of a more robust paradigm, dubbed LLM-as-a-Meta-Judge. This survey reviews recent advances in meta-judging and organizes the literature, by introducing a framework along six key perspectives: (i) Conceptual Foundations, (ii) Mechanisms of Meta-Judging, (iii) Alignment Training Methods, (iv) Evaluation, (v) Limitations and Failure Modes, and (vi) Future Directions.

In particular, an LLM agent may pursue objectives that deviate from human values and ethical norms, a risk known as value misalignment. Existing evaluations primarily focus on responses to explicit harmful input or robustness against system failure, while value misalignment in realistic, fully benign, and agentic settings remains largely underexplored. To fill this gap, we first formalize the Loss-of-Control risk and identify the previously underexamined Intrinsic Value Misalignment (Intrinsic VM). We then introduce IMPRESS (Intrinsic Value Misalignment Probes in REalistic Scenario Set), a scenario-driven framework for systematically assessing this risk. Following our framework, we construct benchmarks composed of realistic, fully benign, and contextualized scenarios, using a multi-stage LLM generation pipeline with rigorous quality control. We evaluate Intrinsic VM on 21 state-of-the-art LLM agents and find that it is a common and broadly observed safety risk across models. Moreover, the misalignment rates vary by motives, risk types, model scales, and architectures. While decoding strategies and hyperparameters exhibit only marginal influence, contextualization and framing mechanisms significantly shape misalignment behaviors. Finally, we conduct human verification to validate our automated judgments and assess existing mitigation strategies, such as safety prompting and guardrails, which show instability or limited effectiveness. We further demonstrate key use cases of IMPRESS across the AI Ecosystem. Our code and benchmark will be publicly released upon acceptance."}

While hybrid attention strategies that combine sparse and full attention within a single model offer a viable solution, they typically employ static computation ratios (i.e., fixed proportions of sparse versus full attention) and fail to adapt to the varying sparsity sensitivities of downstream tasks during inference. To address this issue, we propose Elastic Attention, which allows the model to dynamically adjust its overall sparsity based on the input. This is achieved by integrating a lightweight Attention Router into the existing pretrained model, which dynamically assigns each attention head to different computation modes. Within only 12 hours of training on 8xA800 GPUs, our method enables models to achieve both strong performance and efficient inference. Experiments across three long-context benchmarks on widely-used LLMs demonstrate the superiority of our method."}

The use of language models to reduce the human cost of peer review has been actively explored as a potential solution to this challenge. A method has been proposed to evaluate the level of substantiation in scientific reviews in a manner that is interpretable by humans. This method extracts the core components of an argument, claims and evidence, and assesses the level of substantiation based on the proportion of claims supported by evidence. The level of substantiation refers to the extent to which claims are based on objective facts. However, when assessing the level of substantiation, simply detecting the presence or absence of supporting evidence for a claim is insufficient; it is also necessary to accurately assess the logical inference between a claim and its evidence. We propose a new evaluation metric for scientific review comments that assesses the logical inference between claims and evidence. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a higher correlation with human scores than conventional methods, indicating its potential to better support the efficiency of the peer-review process."}

We identify language- and modality-selective neurons using average-precision ranking, investigate their functional role via median-replacement interventions at inference time, and analyze activation-magnitude inequality across languages and modalities. Across experiments, we find evidence of incomplete modality invariance. Although encoder representations become increasingly language-agnostic, this compression makes it more difficult for the shared decoder to recover the language of origin when constructing modality-agnostic representations, particularly when adapting from speech to text. We further observe sharply localized modality-selective structure in cross-attention key and value projections. Finally, speech-conditioned decoding and non-dominant scripts exhibit higher activation concentration, indicating heavier reliance on a small subset of neurons, which may underlie increased brittleness across modalities and languages."}

We observe that existing MKE benchmarks are typically constructed by mechanically translating English-centric datasets into target languages (e.g., English-to-Chinese). This approach introduces translation artifacts and neglects culturally specific entities native to the target language, failing to reflect the true knowledge distribution of LLMs. To address this, we propose CLM-Bench, a culture-aware benchmark constructed using a native Chinese-first methodology. We curate 1,010 high-quality CounterFact pairs rooted in Chinese cultural contexts and align them with English counterparts. Using CLM-Bench, we conduct extensive experiments on representative LLMs (e.g., Llama-3, Qwen2) and reveal a significant Cross-lingual Misalignment: edits in one language function independently and fail to propagate to the other. We further provide a geometric explanation via layer-wise representation analysis, demonstrating that edit vectors for Chinese and English are nearly orthogonal -- residing in disjoint subspaces -- while mixed-lingual editing exhibits linear additivity of these vectors. Our findings challenge the effectiveness of current methods in cross-lingual transfer and underscore the importance of culturally native benchmarks."}

To address these, we propose ConLLM (Contrastive Learning with Large Language Models), a hybrid framework for robust multimodal deepfake detection. ConLLM employs a two-stage architecture: stage 1 uses Pre-Trained Models (PTMs) to extract modality-specific embeddings; stage 2 aligns these embeddings via contrastive learning to mitigate modality fragmentation, and refines them using LLM-based reasoning to address shallow inter-modal reasoning by capturing semantic inconsistencies. ConLLM demonstrates strong performance across audio, video, and audio-visual modalities. It reduces audio deepfake EER by up to 50%, improves video accuracy by up to 8%, and achieves approximately 9% accuracy gains in audio-visual tasks.

State-of-the-art solutions are based on retrieval augmentation, where relevant context from a user profile is retrieved for LLM consumption.

We introduce $P^3$, an interactive framework for high-quality personalization without revealing private profiles to server-side LLMs. In $P^3$, a large server-side model generates a sequence of $k$ draft tokens based solely on the user query, while a small client-side model, with retrieval access to the user's private profile, evaluates and modifies these drafts to better reflect user preferences. This process repeats until an end token is generated. Experiments on LaMP-QA, a recent benchmark consisting of three personalized question answering datasets, show that $P^3$ consistently outperforms both non-personalized server-side and personalized client-side baselines, achieving statistically significant improvements of $7.4%$ to $9%$ on average. Importantly, $P^3$ recovers $90.3%$ to $95.7%$ of the utility of a ``leaky'' upper-bound scenario in which the full profile is exposed to the large server-side model. Privacy analyses, including linkability and attribute inference attacks, indicate that $P^3$ preserves the privacy of a non-personalized server-side model, introducing only marginal additional leakage ($1.5%$--$3.5%$) compared to submitting a query without any personal context.

In contrast, sequence labeling (SL) tasks assign labels to each individual input token, naturally benefiting from bidirectional context. This discrepancy has historically led SL to rely on inherently bidirectional encoder-only models. However, the rapid development of decoder-only models has raised the question of whether they can be adapted to SL. While causal mask removal has emerged as a viable technique for adapting decoder-only models to leverage the full context for SL, it requires considerable changes to the base model functionality. In this work, we explore sequence repetition (SR) as a less invasive alternative for enabling bidirectionality in decoder-only models. Through fine-tuning experiments, we show that SR inherently makes decoders bidirectional, improving the quality of token-level embeddings and surpassing encoders and unmasked decoders. Contrary to earlier claims, we find that increasing the number of repetitions does not degrade SL performance. Finally, we demonstrate that embeddings from intermediate layers are highly effective for SR, comparable to those from final layers, while being significantly more efficient to compute. Our findings underscore that SR alleviates the structural limitations of decoders, enabling more efficient and adaptable LMs and broadening their applicability to other token-level tasks."}

While much prior work treats reasoning as a linear chain of steps, many reasoning problems are more naturally structured as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where intermediate conclusions may depend on multiple premises, branch into parallel sub-derivations, and later merge or be reused. Understanding whether such graph-structured reasoning is reflected in model internals remains an open question.\n  In this work, we introduce Reasoning DAG Probing, a framework that directly asks whether LLM hidden states encode the geometry of a reasoning DAG in a linearly accessible form, and where this structure emerges across layers. Within this framework, we associate each reasoning node with a textual realization and train lightweight probes to predict two graph-theoretic properties from hidden states: node depth and pairwise node distance. We use these probes to analyze the layerwise emergence of DAG structure and evaluate controls that disrupt reasoning-relevant structure while preserving superficial textual properties. Our results provide evidence that reasoning DAG geometry is meaningfully encoded in intermediate layers, with recoverability varying systematically by node depth and model scale, suggesting that LLM reasoning is not only sequential but exhibits measurable internal graph structure."}

Large language models contain extensive knowledge from years of research across these domains. We propose LoID (Logit-Informed Distributions), a deterministic method for extracting informative prior distributions for Bayesian logistic regression by directly accessing their token-level predictions. Rather than relying on generated text, we probe the model's confidence in opposing semantic directions (positive vs. negative impact) through carefully constructed sentences. By measuring how consistently the LLM favors one direction across diverse phrasings, we extract the strength and reliability of the model's belief about each feature's influence. We evaluate LoID on ten real-world tabular datasets under synthetic out-of-distribution (OOD) settings characterized by covariate shift, where the training data represents only a subset of the population. We compare our approach against (1) standard uninformative priors, (2) AutoElicit, a recent method that prompts LLMs to generate priors via text completions, (3) LLMProcesses, a method that uses LLMs to generate numerical predictions through in-context learning and (4) an oracle-style upper bound derived from fitting logistic regression on the full dataset. We assess performance using Area Under the Curve (AUC). Across datasets, LoID significantly improves performance over logistic regression trained on OOD data, recovering up to \\textbf{59\\%} of the performance gap relative to the oracle model.

Beyond this public impact lies a deeply personal toll on the friends and families of conspiracy believers, a dimension often overlooked in large-scale computational research. This study fills this gap by systematically mapping radicalization journeys and quantifying the associated emotional toll inflicted on loved ones. We use the prominent case of QAnon as a case study, analyzing 12747 narratives from the r/QAnonCasualties support community through a novel mixed-methods approach. First, we use topic modeling (BERTopic) to map the radicalization trajectories, identifying key pre-existing conditions, triggers, and post-radicalization characteristics. From this, we apply an LDA-based graphical model to uncover six recurring archetypes of QAnon adherents, which we term \"radicalization personas.\" Finally, using LLM-assisted emotion detection and regression modeling, we link these personas to the specific emotional toll reported by narrators. Our findings reveal that these personas are not just descriptive; they are powerful predictors of the specific emotional harms experienced by narrators. Radicalization perceived as a deliberate ideological choice is associated with narrator anger and disgust, while those marked by personal and cognitive collapse are linked to fear and sadness. This work provides the first empirical framework for understanding radicalization as a relational phenomenon, offering a vital roadmap for researchers and practitioners to navigate its interpersonal fallout."}

During training, the model first translates questions into the pivot language to facilitate better alignment of reasoning patterns. The reasoning process in the target language is then supervised by the pivot language's reasoning answers, thereby establishing a cross-lingual self-feedback mechanism without relying on external correct answers or reward models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method enhances both the model's understanding of questions and its reasoning capabilities, leading to notable task improvements."}

S3-Attention decodes transient key and query projections into top-k sparse feature identifiers using lightweight sparse autoencoders, and constructs a CPU-based inverted index mapping features to token positions or spans during a single streaming scan.

We evaluate the performance of DDR in experiments designed as a series of perturbations applied to sentences drawn from a sentence dataset. For each sentence, we generate variants by replacing one, two, or three words with either synonyms, which constitute semantically similar text, or randomly chosen words, which constitute semantically dissimilar text.

Prior work suggests that language models (LMs) exhibit limited inherent moral reasoning, leading to calls for explicit moral teaching. However, constructing ground truth data for moral evaluation is difficult given plural frameworks and pervasive biases. We investigate unsupervised elicitation as an alternative, asking whether pretrained (base) LMs possess intrinsic moral reasoning capability that can be surfaced without human supervision. Using the Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM) algorithm across three benchmark datasets and four LMs, we test whether ICM can reliably label moral judgments, generalize across moral frameworks, and mitigate social bias. Results show that ICM outperforms all pre-trained and chatbot baselines on the Norm Bank and ETHICS benchmarks, while fine-tuning on ICM labels performs on par with or surpasses those of human labels. Across theoretically motivated moral frameworks, ICM yields its largest relative gains on Justice and Commonsense morality. Furthermore, although chatbot LMs exhibit social bias failure rates comparable to their pretrained ones, ICM reduces such errors by more than half, with the largest improvements in race, socioeconomic status, and politics. These findings suggest that pretrained LMs possess latent moral reasoning capacities that can be elicited through unsupervised methods like ICM, providing a scalable path for AI alignment."}

It enables large language models (LLMs) to perform complex reasoning beyond text-chunk retrieval. Recent works have employed reinforcement learning (RL) to train agentic GraphRAG frameworks that perform iterative interactions between LLMs and knowledge graphs. However, existing RL-based frameworks such as Graph-R1 suffer from two key limitations: (1) they primarily depend on semantic similarity for retrieval, often overlooking the underlying graph structure, and (2) they rely on sparse, outcome-level rewards, failing to capture the quality of intermediate retrieval steps and their dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose ProGraph-R1, a progress-aware agentic framework for graph-based retrieval and multi-step reasoning. ProGraph-R1 introduces a structure-aware hypergraph retrieval mechanism that jointly considers semantic relevance and graph connectivity, encouraging coherent traversal along multi-hop reasoning paths. We also design a progress-based step-wise policy optimization, which provides dense learning signals by modulating advantages according to intermediate reasoning progress within a graph, rather than relying solely on final outcomes. Experiments on multi-hop question answering benchmarks demonstrate that ProGraph-R1 consistently improves reasoning accuracy and generation quality over existing GraphRAG methods."}

We use several methods to extract gender-biased utterances, including lexicon-based mining, computational classification models, translation-based comparison analysis, and GPT-based bias creation. Our research indicates that the straight application of English-centric bias detection frameworks to Bengali is severely constrained by language disparities and socio-cultural factors that impact implicit biases. To tackle these difficulties, we executed two field investigations inside rural and low-income areas, gathering authentic insights on gender bias. The findings demonstrate that gender bias in Bengali presents distinct characteristics relative to English, requiring a more localized and context-sensitive methodology. Additionally, our research emphasizes the need of integrating community-driven research approaches to identify culturally relevant biases often neglected by automated systems. Our research enhances the ongoing discussion around gender bias in AI by illustrating the need to create linguistic tools specifically designed for underrepresented languages.

In this paper, we propose a principled approach to disentangle and isolate task-specific parameter regions, motivated by the hypothesis that parameter heterogeneity underlies cross-task interference. Specifically, we first independently fine-tune LLMs on diverse SFT tasks and identify each task's core parameter region as the subset of parameters exhibiting the largest updates. Tasks with highly overlapping core parameter regions are merged for joint training, while disjoint tasks are organized into different stages. During multi-stage SFT, core parameters acquired in prior tasks are frozen, thereby preventing overwriting by subsequent tasks. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we conducted intensive experiments on multiple public datasets. The results showed that our dynamic parameter isolation strategy consistently reduced data conflicts and achieved consistent performance improvements compared to multi-stage and multi-task tuning baselines."}

Through controlled distribution-sampling simulations, we uncover a striking dichotomy in LLM behavior, distinguishing two model types: D-models (e.g. Qwen-2.5), whose P_token exhibits large step-to-step variability and poor alignment with P_task; and E-models (e.g. Mistral-Small), whose P_token is more stable and better aligned with P_task. We further evaluate these two model types in downstream tasks such as code generation and recommendation, revealing systematic trade-offs between diversity and stability that shape task outcomes. Finally, we analyze the internal properties of both model families to probe their underlying mechanisms. These findings offer foundational insights into the probabilistic sampling behavior of LLMs and provide practical guidance on when to favor D- versus E-models. For web-scale applications, including recommendation, search, and conversational agents, our results inform model selection and configuration to balance diversity with reliability under real-world uncertainty, providing a better level of interpretation."}

We empirically show that the emergence of learning structural information correlates with complex reasoning tasks, and that the ability to perform test-time compositional generation remains limited."}

When handling such complex tasks, existing agents manage context at the subtask level to overcome linear context accumulation and information loss. However, they still adhere to a single context window and sequential execution paradigm, which results in mutual interference and blocking behavior, restricting scalability and adaptability. To address this issue, this paper introduces Self-Manager, a parallel agent loop that enables asynchronous and concurrent execution. The main thread can create multiple subthreads, each with its own isolated context, and manage them iteratively through Thread Control Blocks, allowing for more focused and flexible parallel agent execution. To assess its effectiveness, we benchmark Self-Manager on DeepResearch Bench, where it consistently outperforms existing single-agent loop baselines across all metrics. Furthermore, we conduct extensive analytical experiments to demonstrate the necessity of Self-Manager's design choices, as well as its advantages in contextual capacity, efficiency, and generalization."}

We conduct a systematic evaluation of open-source LLMs on both flat and nested NER tasks. We investigate several research questions including the performance gap between generative NER and traditional NER models, the impact of output formats, whether LLMs rely on memorization, and the preservation of general capabilities after fine-tuning. Through experiments across eight LLMs of varying scales and four standard NER datasets, we find that: (1) With parameter-efficient fine-tuning and structured formats like inline bracketed or XML, open-source LLMs achieve performance competitive with traditional encoder-based models and surpass closed-source LLMs like GPT-3; (2) The NER capability of LLMs stems from instruction-following and generative power, not mere memorization of entity-label pairs; and (3) Applying NER instruction tuning has minimal impact on general capabilities of LLMs, even improving performance on datasets like DROP due to enhanced entity understanding. These findings demonstrate that generative NER with LLMs is a promising, user-friendly alternative to traditional methods. We release the data and code at https://github.com/szu-tera/LLMs4NER."}

The vanilla LoRA is implemented with uniform ranks, and the recent literature have found that properly allocating ranks on the LLM backbones results in performance boosts. However, the previous rank allocation methods have limitations since they rely on inexplanable and unreliable importance measures for the LoRA ranks. To address the above issues, we propose the ShapLoRA framework. Inspired by the explanable attribution measure Shapley Value, we combine the sensitivity-based measures with the idea of coalitions in the collaborative games among LoRA ranks, and propose a more explainable importance measure called Shapley sensitivity. In addition, we optimize the workflow of the existing works by: (a) calculating Shapley sensitivity on a separate validation set; (b) Setting up the allocating-retraining procedures for fair comparisons. We have conducted experiments on various challenging tasks, and the experimental results demonstrate that our ShapLoRA method can outperform the recent baselines with comparable tunable parameters.\\footnote{Codes and fine-tuned models will be open-sourced to facilitate future research."}

We introduce a unified interpretability framework that integrates attributional and mechanistic perspectives through monosemantic feature extraction. By constructing a monosemantic embedding space at the level of an LLM layer and optimizing the framework to explicitly reduce inter-method variability, our approach produces stable input-level importance scores and highlights salient features via a decompressed representation of the layer of interest, advancing the safe and trustworthy application of LLMs in cognitive health and neurodegenerative disease."}

We present an iterative, prompt-based framework for constructing a Cultural Commonsense Knowledge Graph (CCKG) that treats LLMs as cultural archives, systematically eliciting culture-specific entities, relations, and practices and composing them into multi-step inferential chains across languages. We evaluate CCKG on five countries with human judgments of cultural relevance, correctness, and path coherence. We find that the cultural knowledge graphs are better realized in English, even when the target culture is non-English (e.g., Chinese, Indonesian, Arabic), indicating uneven cultural encoding in current LLMs. Augmenting smaller LLMs with CCKG improves performance on cultural reasoning and story generation, with the largest gains from English chains. Our results show both the promise and limits of LLMs as cultural technologies and that chain-structured cultural knowledge is a practical substrate for culturally grounded NLP."}

We introduce Semantic Diversity-Exploration-Exploitation (SD-E$^2$), a reinforcement learning framework that makes exploration explicit by optimizing semantic diversity in generated reasoning trajectories.

This diversity reward is combined with outcome correctness and solution efficiency in a z-score-normalized multi-objective objective that stabilizes training.

In addition, we elicit token-level concreteness ratings from models and evaluate alignment to human norm distributions, testing whether multimodal training yields more human-consistent judgments.

To this end, we identify two core requirements: (1) adoptability, the ability to transform a base model into a general-purpose assistant, and (2) sovereign capability, the ability to perform high-stakes, region-specific tasks (e.g., legal reasoning in local languages and cultural knowledge). We investigate whether these requirements can be achieved without scaling massive instruction corpora or relying on complex preference tuning pipelines and large-scale reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). We present Typhoon S, a minimal and open post-training recipe that combines supervised fine-tuning, on-policy distillation, and small-scale RFT. Using Thai as a representative case study, we demonstrate that our approach transforms both sovereign-adapted and general-purpose base models into instruction-tuned models with strong general performance. We further show that small-scale RFT with InK-GRPO -- an extension of GRPO that augments the GRPO loss with a next-word prediction loss -- improves Thai legal reasoning and Thai-specific knowledge while preserving general capabilities. Our results suggest that a carefully designed post-training strategy can reduce the required scale of instruction data and computation, providing a practical path toward high-quality sovereign LLMs under academic-scale resources."}

In this work, we benchmark three modeling families on the GoEmotions dataset: a TF-IDF-based logistic regression system trained with binary relevance, a BiLSTM with attention, and a BERT model fine-tuned for multi-label classification. Experiments follow the official train/validation/test split, and imbalance is mitigated using inverse-frequency class weights. Across several metrics, namely Micro-F1, Macro-F1, Hamming Loss, and Subset Accuracy, we observe that logistic regression attains the highest Micro-F1 of 0.51, while BERT achieves the best overall balance surpassing the official paper's reported results, reaching Macro-F1 0.49, Hamming Loss 0.036, and Subset Accuracy 0.36.

MemWeaver employs a dual-channel retrieval strategy that jointly retrieves structured knowledge and supporting evidence to construct compact yet information-dense contexts for reasoning.

One way to overcome this problem is to fine-tune on real world hand-drawn images, but it is not practically possible to generate large number of such images. In this paper, we introduce a large synthetically generated corpus (reflective of real world images) for training VLMs and subsequently evaluate VLMs on a smaller corpus of hand-drawn images (with the help of humans). We introduce several new self-supervision tasks for training and perform extensive experiments with various baseline models and fine-tune Llama 3.2 11B-instruct model on synthetic images on these tasks to obtain LLama-VL-TUG, which significantly improves the ROUGE-L performance of Llama 3.2 11B-instruct by 2.14x and achieves the best all-round performance across all baseline models.

It employs a polarization-index-based bootstrapping mechanism to automate rubric generation and utilizes Partial Least Squares (PLS) to map hidden states to continuous scores. Experiments on industrial datasets show that BoRP (Qwen3-8B/14B) significantly outperforms generative baselines (even Qwen3-Max) in alignment with human judgments.

Such reliance is fundamentally limited for modeling complex empathy, as there is no single \"correct\" response and a simple numerical score cannot fully capture the nuances of emotional expression or the appropriateness of empathetic behavior. To address these limitations, we sequentially introduce EmpathyEval, a descriptive natural-language-based evaluation model for assessing empathetic quality in spoken dialogues. Building upon EmpathyEval, we propose ReEmpathy, an end-to-end SLM that enhances empathetic dialogue through a novel Empathetic Self-Reflective Alternating Inference mechanism, which interleaves spoken response generation with free-form, empathy-related reflective reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReEmpathy substantially improves empathy-sensitive spoken dialogue by enabling reflective reasoning, offering a promising approach toward more emotionally intelligent and empathy-aware human-computer interactions."}

Existing context-folding methods mitigate this issue by summarizing past interactions, yet they are typically designed for single-query or single-intent scenarios.

To address these limitations, we propose U-Fold, a dynamic context-folding framework tailored to user-centric tasks. U-Fold retains the full user--agent dialogue and tool-call history but, at each turn, uses two core components to produce an intent-aware, evolving dialogue summary and a compact, task-relevant tool log. Extensive experiments on $τ$-bench, $τ^2$-bench, VitaBench, and harder context-inflated settings show that U-Fold consistently outperforms ReAct (achieving a 71.4% win rate in long-context settings) and prior folding baselines (with improvements of up to 27.0%), particularly on long, noisy, multi-turn tasks. Our study demonstrates that U-Fold is a promising step toward transferring context-management techniques from single-query benchmarks to realistic user-centric applications."}

Many recent pre-trained models have been reported to exhibit only slight changes in the angular distance between the input and output hidden state vectors in the middle Transformer layers, despite a disproportionately large ``jump'' in the angular distance occurring in or around the final Transformer layer. To characterize this, we first introduce a quantitative metric for the jump strength around the final layer, and then demonstrate its prevalence across many open-weight models, as well as its amplification throughout pre-training. Assuming such jumps indicate an undesirable property, we propose the jump-suppressing regularizer (JREG) which penalizes this jump during pre-training, thereby encouraging more balanced capability usage across the middle layers. Empirical evaluations of three model sizes of Llama-based models, trained with the proposed JREG method, reveal improved task performance compared to the baseline without altering the model architecture."}

Existing post-training quantization methods typically use small, English-only calibration sets; however, their impact on multilingual models remains underexplored. We systematically evaluate eight calibration settings (five single-language and three multilingual mixes) on two quantizers (GPTQ, AWQ) on data from 10 languages. Our findings reveal a consistent trend: non-English and multilingual calibration sets significantly improve perplexity compared to English-only baselines. Specifically, we observe notable average perplexity gains across both quantizers on Llama3.1 8B and Qwen2.5 7B, with multilingual mixes achieving the largest overall reductions of up to 3.52 points in perplexity. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that tailoring calibration sets to the evaluation language yields the largest improvements for individual languages, underscoring the importance of linguistic alignment. We also identify specific failure cases where certain language-quantizer combinations degrade performance, which we trace to differences in activation range distributions across languages. These results highlight that static one-size-fits-all calibration is suboptimal and that tailoring calibration data, both in language and diversity, plays a crucial role in robustly quantizing multilingual LLMs."}

To address this gap, we propose MultiVis-Agent, a logic rule-enhanced multi-agent framework for reliable multi-modal and multi-scenario visualization generation. Our approach introduces a four-layer logic rule framework that provides mathematical guarantees for system reliability while maintaining flexibility.

Through an extensive scaling analysis of the Qwen-3 and Llama-3 families, we identify a clear scaling trajectory for resilience. Furthermore, we reveal a counter-intuitive vulnerability in reasoning-optimized \"Thinking\" models: while they demonstrate high vanilla accuracy, their internal reasoning traces frequently rationalize incorrect user suggestions under authoritative pressure. Our results across frontier models suggest that benchmark performance is not a proxy for clinical reliability, and that simplified reasoning structures may offer superior robustness against expert-driven sycophancy."}

We probe this phenomenon using Baba Is You, where physical laws are mutable text rules, enabling precise evaluation of models' ability to override learned priors when rules change. We quantatively observe that larger models can exhibit inverse scaling: they perform worse than smaller models when natural language reasoning requires suppressing pre-trained associations (e.g., accepting \"Lava is Safe\"). Our analysis attributes this to natural language encoding, which entangles descriptive semantics and logical rules, leading to persistent hallucinations of familiar physics despite explicit contradictory rules. Here we show that representing dynamics as executable code, rather than descriptive text, reverses this trend and enables effective prior inhibition. We introduce Code-Grounded Vistas (LCV), which fine-tunes models on counterfactual pairs and identifies states with contradictory rules, thereby forcing attention to logical constraints rather than visual semantics. This training-time approach outperforms expensive inference-time search methods in both efficiency and accuracy. Our results demonstrate that representation fundamentally determines whether scaling improves or impairs contextual reasoning. This challenges the assumption that larger models are universally better, with implications for domains that require dynamic overriding of learned priors."}

Unlike prior work, our method revises the full hierarchy to better match the semantics encoded by LMs. Experiments across three HTC benchmarks show that LLM-refined taxonomies consistently outperform human-curated ones in various settings up to +2.9pp. in F1. To better understand these improvements, we compare how well LMs can assign leaf nodes to parent nodes and vice versa across human-curated and LLM-refined taxonomies. We find that human-curated taxonomies lead to more easily separable clusters in embedding space. However, the LLM-refined taxonomies align more closely with the model's actual confusion patterns during classification. In other words, even though they are harder to separate, they better reflect the model's inductive biases. These findings suggest that LLM-guided refinement creates taxonomies that are more compatible with how models learn, improving HTC performance."}

But these research works focus more on well-resourced languages such as English, Japanese, German, French, Russian, Mandarin Chinese, etc. Over 95% of the world's 7000 languages are low-resourced for NLP, i.e. they have little or no data, tools, and techniques for NLP work.\n  In this thesis, we present an overview of diacritic ambiguity and a review of previous diacritic disambiguation approaches on other languages. Focusing on the Igbo language, we report the steps taken to develop a flexible framework for generating datasets for diacritic restoration. Three main approaches, the standard n-gram model, the classification models and the embedding models were proposed. The standard n-gram models use a sequence of previous words to the target stripped word as key predictors of the correct variants. For the classification models, a window of words on both sides of the target stripped word was used. The embedding models compare the similarity scores of the combined context word embeddings and the embeddings of each of the candidate variant vectors."}

We fine tuned Llama 3.1 8B Instruct to learn ontology term identifier mappings from the Human Phenotype Ontology (800 pairs) and the Gene Ontology (400 training pairs), withholding 400 GO pairs to test generalization. Treating learning as a time to event process across 20 epochs, we used stochastic decoding to detect latent knowledge at baseline and Cox proportional hazards models to identify predictors of acquisition, generalization, and degradation. Baseline deterministic recall for HPO was 2.8%, rising to 71.9% after fine-tuning. Latent knowledge was the strongest predictor of faster fact acquisition (HR 2.6) and was associated with earlier, higher peak learning rates and faster convergence; identifier frequency and curated annotation counts had smaller effects. Generalization to withheld GO facts was uncommon (5.8%) but more likely when latent knowledge was present. Previously correct GO mappings degraded more often for withheld (unseen) terms than for trained (seen) terms, suggesting a protective effect of reinforcement during training. These results show that latent knowledge predicts both the speed of factual learning during fine-tuning and the limited generalization of unseen ontology facts, while resistance to degradation depends on whether facts are reinforced."}

We introduce an evaluation framework for fine-grained controllability for both single- and dual-concept scenarios, focusing on linguistically distinct concept pairs (e.g., persuasiveness vs.~humor). Surprisingly, across multiple LLMs and generative tasks, we find that performance often drops in the dual-concept setting, even though the chosen concepts should in principle be separable.

Our framework provides systematic evidence of this gap and offers a principled approach for measuring the ability of future methods for multi-concept control."}

This approach typically uses a single demographic cue in isolation (e.g., a name or dialect) as a signal for group membership, implicitly assuming strong construct validity: that such cues are interchangeable operationalizations of the same underlying, demographically conditioned behavior. We test this assumption in realistic advice-seeking interactions, focusing on race and gender in a U.S. context. We find that cues intended to represent the same demographic group induce only partially overlapping changes in model behavior, while differentiation between groups within a given cue is weak and uneven. Consequently, estimated disparities are unstable, with both magnitude and direction varying across cues. We further show that these inconsistencies partly arise from variation in how strongly cues encode demographic attributes and from linguistic confounders that independently shape model behavior. Together, our findings suggest that demographic probing lacks construct validity: it does not yield a single, stable characterization of how LLMs condition on demographic information, which may reflect a misspecified or fragmented construct. We conclude by recommending the use of multiple, ecologically valid cues and explicit control of confounders to support more defensible claims about demographic effects in LLMs."}

In this paper, we present SWITCH, the Social Work Interactive Training Chatbot. SWITCH integrates realistic client simulation, real-time counseling skill classification, and a Motivational Interviewing (MI) progression system into the training workflow. To model a client, SWITCH uses a cognitively grounded profile comprising static fields (e.g., background, beliefs) and dynamic fields (e.g., emotions, automatic thoughts, openness), allowing the agent's behavior to evolve throughout a session realistically. The skill classification module identifies the counseling skills from the user utterances, and feeds the result to the MI controller that regulates the MI stage transitions. To enhance classification accuracy, we study in-context learning with retrieval over annotated transcripts, and a fine-tuned BERT multi-label classifier. In the experiments, we demonstrated that both BERT-based approach and in-context learning outperforms the baseline with big margin. SWITCH thereby offers a scalable, low-cost, and consistent training workflow that complements field education, and allows supervisors to focus on higher-level mentorship."}

However, extending this paradigm to open-ended generation is challenging because there is no unambiguous ground truth. Relying on single-dot supervision often leads to inefficiency and reward hacking. To address these issues, we propose reinforcement learning with verifiable reference-based rewards (RLVRR). Instead of checking the final answer, RLVRR extracts an ordered linguistic signal from high-quality references (i.e, reward chain). Specifically, RLVRR decomposes rewards into two dimensions: content, which preserves deterministic core concepts (e.g., keywords), and style, which evaluates adherence to stylistic properties through LLM-based verification. In this way, RLVRR combines the exploratory strength of RL with the efficiency and reliability of supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Extensive experiments on more than 10 benchmarks with Qwen and Llama models confirm the advantages of our approach. RLVRR (1) substantially outperforms SFT trained with ten times more data and advanced reward models, (2) unifies the training of structured reasoning and open-ended generation, and (3) generalizes more effectively while preserving output diversity. These results establish RLVRR as a principled and efficient path toward verifiable reinforcement learning for general-purpose LLM alignment. We release our code and data at https://github.com/YJiangcm/RLVRR."}

We refer to these covert, goal-directed behaviours as hidden intentions, which may arise from training and optimisation artefacts, or be deliberately induced by an adversarial developer, yet remain difficult to detect in practice. We introduce a taxonomy of ten categories of hidden intentions, grounded in social science research and organised by intent, mechanism, context, and impact, shifting attention from surface-level behaviours to design-level strategies of influence. We show how hidden intentions can be easily induced in controlled models, providing both testbeds for evaluation and demonstrations of potential misuse. We systematically assess detection methods, including reasoning and non-reasoning LLM judges, and find that detection collapses in realistic open-world settings, particularly under low-prevalence conditions, where false positives overwhelm precision and false negatives conceal true risks. Stress tests on precision-prevalence and precision-FNR trade-offs reveal why auditing fails without vanishingly small false positive rates or strong priors on manipulation types. Finally, a qualitative case study shows that all ten categories manifest in deployed, state-of-the-art LLMs, emphasising the urgent need for robust frameworks. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of detectability failures of hidden intentions in LLMs under open-world settings, offering a foundation for understanding, inducing, and stress-testing such behaviours, and establishing a flexible taxonomy for anticipating evolving threats and informing governance."}

Prior work has employed so-called personas, sociodemographic user attributes conveyed to a model, to study bias in LLMs by relying on a single cue to prompt a persona, such as user names or explicit attribute mentions. This disregards LLM sensitivity to prompt variations (robustness) and the rarity of some cues in real interactions (external validity). We compare six commonly used persona cues across seven open and proprietary LLMs on four writing and advice tasks. While cues are overall highly correlated, they produce substantial variance in responses across personas. We therefore caution against claims from a single persona cue and recommend future personalization research to evaluate multiple externally valid cues."}

The advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer novel perspectives for personality detection tasks. Existing approaches enhance personality trait analysis by leveraging LLMs to extract semantic information from textual posts as prompts, followed by training classifiers for categorization. However, accurately classifying personality traits remains challenging due to the inherent complexity of human personality and subtle inter-trait distinctions. Moreover, prompt-based methods often exhibit excessive dependency on expert-crafted knowledge without autonomous pattern-learning capacity. To address these limitations, we view personality detection as a ranking task rather than a classification and propose a corresponding reinforcement learning training paradigm. First, we employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to establish personality trait ranking capabilities while enforcing standardized output formats, creating a robust initialization. Subsequently, we introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a specialized ranking-based reward function. Unlike verification tasks with definitive solutions, personality assessment involves subjective interpretations and blurred boundaries between trait categories. Our reward function explicitly addresses this challenge by training LLMs to learn optimal answer rankings. Comprehensive experiments have demonstrated that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple personality detection benchmarks."}

However, these approaches are computationally demanding, require careful engineering and tuning, and often require difficult-to-obtain human annotation data. We propose \\textsc{reflect}, an inference-time framework for constitutional alignment that does not require any training or data, providing a plug-and-play approach for aligning an instruction-tuned model to a set of principles. \\textsc{reflect} operates entirely in-context, combining a (i) constitution-conditioned base response with post-generation (ii) self-evaluation, (iii)(a) self-critique, and (iii)(b) final revision. \\textsc{reflect}'s technique of explicit in-context reasoning over principles during post-generation outperforms standard few-shot prompting and provides transparent reasoning traces. Our results demonstrate that \\textsc{reflect} significantly improves LLM conformance to diverse and complex principles, including principles quite distinct from those emphasized in the model's original parameter fine-tuning, without sacrificing factual reasoning. \\textsc{reflect} is particularly effective at reducing the rate of rare but significant violations of principles, thereby improving safety and robustness in the tail end of the distribution of generations. Finally, we show that \\textsc{reflect} naturally generates useful training data for traditional parameter fine-tuning techniques, allowing for efficient scaling and the reduction of inference-time computational overhead in long-term deployment scenarios."}

This relies on personalized reward models that capture user-specific preferences and automatically provide individualized feedback. However, developing these models faces two critical challenges: the scarcity of feedback from individual users and the need for efficient adaptation to unseen users. We argue that addressing these constraints requires a paradigm shift from fitting data to learn user preferences to learn the process of preference adaptation. To realize this, we propose Meta Reward Modeling (MRM), which reformulates personalized reward modeling as a meta-learning problem. Specifically, we represent each user's reward model as a weighted combination of base reward functions, and optimize the initialization of these weights using a Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)-style framework to support fast adaptation under limited feedback. To ensure robustness, we introduce the Robust Personalization Objective (RPO), which places greater emphasis on hard-to-learn users during meta optimization. Extensive experiments on personalized preference datasets validate that MRM enhances few-shot personalization, improves user robustness, and consistently outperforms baselines."}

However, existing search frameworks still rely heavily on implicit natural language reasoning to determine search strategies and how to leverage retrieved information across reasoning steps. This reliance on implicit reasoning creates fundamental challenges for managing dependencies between sub-questions, efficiently reusing previously retrieved knowledge, and learning optimal search strategies through reinforcement learning. To address these limitations, we propose Dep-Search, a dependency-aware search framework that advances beyond existing search frameworks by integrating structured reasoning, retrieval, and persistent memory through GRPO. Dep-Search introduces explicit control mechanisms that enable the model to decompose questions with dependency relationships, retrieve information when needed, access previously stored knowledge from memory, and summarize long reasoning contexts into reusable memory entries. Through extensive experiments on seven diverse question answering datasets, we demonstrate that Dep-Search significantly enhances LLMs' ability to tackle complex multi-hop reasoning tasks, achieving substantial improvements over strong baselines across different model scales."}

In contrast, specialized reasoning models (like Qwen-3-32b and GPT-5-nano) often ignore the emergency entirely, maintaining over 95 percent task completion rates while the user describes dying. Furthermore, the computational time required for reasoning introduces dangerous delays: up to 15 seconds before any potential help is offered.

We developed two transformer-based architectures, SpeechCARE-AGF and Whisper-LWF-LoRA, on the multilingual NIA PREPARE Challenge dataset.

In this study, we present replications of four published safety test sets targeting suicide risk assessment, harmful content generation, refusal robustness, and adversarial jailbreaks for a leading frontier generic AI model alongside an AI purpose built for mental health support. We then propose and conduct an ecological audit on over 20,000 real-world user conversations with the purpose-built AI designed with layered suicide and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) safeguards to compare test set performance to real world performance. While the purpose-built AI was significantly less likely than general-purpose LLMs to produce enabling or harmful content across suicide/NSSI (.4-11.27% vs 29.0-54.4%), eating disorder (8.4% vs 54.0%), and substance use (9.9% vs 45.0%) benchmark prompts, test set failure rates for suicide/NSSI were far higher than in real-world deployment. Clinician review of flagged conversations from the ecological audit identified zero cases of suicide risk that failed to receive crisis resources. Across all 20,000 conversations, three mentions of NSSI risk (.015%) did not trigger a crisis intervention; among sessions flagged by the LLM judge, this corresponds to an end-to-end system false negative rate of .38%, providing a lower bound on real-world safety failures. These findings support a shift toward continuous, deployment-relevant safety assurance for AI mental-health systems rather than limited set benchmark certification."}

Existing computational approaches, such as affiliation diversity, keywords, and citation patterns, do not account for how individual citations are used to advance the citing work. Although, in line with addressing this gap, prior studies have proposed taxonomies to classify citation purpose, these frameworks are not well-suited to interdisciplinary research and do not provide quantitative measures of citation engagement quality. To address these limitations, we propose a framework for the evaluation of citation engagement in interdisciplinary Natural Language Processing (NLP) publications. Our approach introduces a citation purpose taxonomy tailored to interdisciplinary work, supported by an annotation study. We demonstrate the utility of this framework through a thorough analysis of publications at the intersection of NLP and Computational Social Science."}

Using two high-quality detection methods, we find a substantial increase in LLM-generated content across both review and non-review papers, with a higher prevalence in review papers.

Driven by (i) rising demands for application-ready data (e.g., for analytics, visualization, decision-making), (ii) increasingly powerful LLM techniques, and (iii) the emergence of infrastructures that facilitate flexible agent construction (e.g., using Databricks Unity Catalog), LLM-enhanced methods are rapidly becoming a transformative and potentially dominant paradigm for data preparation.\n  By investigating hundreds of recent literature works, this paper presents a systematic review of this evolving landscape, focusing on the use of LLM techniques to prepare data for diverse downstream tasks. First, we characterize the fundamental paradigm shift, from rule-based, model-specific pipelines to prompt-driven, context-aware, and agentic preparation workflows. Next, we introduce a task-centric taxonomy that organizes the field into three major tasks: data cleaning (e.g., standardization, error processing, imputation), data integration (e.g., entity matching, schema matching), and data enrichment (e.g., data annotation, profiling). For each task, we survey representative techniques, and highlight their respective strengths (e.g., improved generalization, semantic understanding) and limitations (e.g., the prohibitive cost of scaling LLMs, persistent hallucinations even in advanced agents, the mismatch between advanced methods and weak evaluation). Moreover, we analyze commonly used datasets and evaluation metrics (the empirical part). Finally, we discuss open research challenges and outline a forward-looking roadmap that emphasizes scalable LLM-data systems, principled designs for reliable agentic workflows, and robust evaluation protocols."}

This work studies moral robustness in VLMs, defined as the ability to preserve moral judgments under textual and visual perturbations that do not alter the underlying moral context. We systematically probe VLMs with a diverse set of model-agnostic multimodal perturbations and find that their moral stances are highly fragile, frequently flipping under simple manipulations. Our analysis reveals systematic vulnerabilities across perturbation types, moral domains, and model scales, including a sycophancy trade-off where stronger instruction-following models are more susceptible to persuasion. We further show that lightweight inference-time interventions can partially restore moral stability. These results demonstrate that moral alignment alone is insufficient and that moral robustness is a necessary criterion for the responsible deployment of VLMs."}

We propose an architectural principle, the mouth is not the brain, that explicitly separates world models from language models. Our architecture comprises three components: a Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM) that captures domain structure as an energy-based world model, an adapter that projects latent belief states into embedding space, and a frozen GPT-2 that provides linguistic competence without domain knowledge. We instantiate this framework in the consumer review domain using Amazon smartphone reviews. Experiments demonstrate that (1) conditioning through the world model yields significantly higher sentiment correlation, lower perplexity, and greater semantic similarity compared to prompt-based generation alone; (2) the DBM's energy function distinguishes coherent from incoherent market configurations, assigning higher energy to implausible brand-price combinations; and (3) interventions on specific attributes propagate causally to generated text with intervened outputs exhibiting distributions statistically consistent with naturally occurring samples sharing the target configuration. These findings suggest that even small-scale language models can achieve consistent, controllable generation when connected to an appropriate world model, providing empirical support for separating linguistic competence from world understanding."}

We employed a 2 (Model Origin: US vs. China) $\\times$ 2 (Prompt Language: English vs. Chinese) factorial design across eight multimodal tasks, uniquely incorporating image generation and interpretation to extend analysis beyond textual boundaries. Results revealed inconsistencies with both dominant paradigms: Model origin did not predict cultural alignment, with US models frequently exhibiting ``holistic'' traits typically associated with East Asian data. Similarly, prompt language did not trigger stable cultural frame-switching; instead, we observed \\textbf{Cultural Reversal}, where English prompts paradoxically elicited higher contextual attention than Chinese prompts. Crucially, we identified a novel phenomenon termed \\textbf{Service Persona Camouflage}: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) collapsed cultural variance in affective tasks into a hyper-positive, zero-variance ``helpful assistant'' persona.

Conventional fine-tuning, however, can cause syntactic inconsistencies and produce inefficient queries. To overcome this, we introduce Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)-Masking, a structure-aware fine-tuning method that uses SQL ASTs to assign weights to key components and enforce syntax-aware learning without adding inference overhead. Experiments show that AST-Masking significantly improves SQL generation accuracy across multiple language models. FLAN-T5 reaches an Execution Accuracy (EA) of 99.6%, while Gemma achieves the largest absolute gain from 7.5% to 72.0%.

Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we design controlled extraction probes to quantify unintended PII memorization and study how factors such as language, PII frequency, task type, and model size influence memorization behavior. We further benchmark four privacy-preserving approaches including differential privacy, machine unlearning, regularization, and preference alignment, evaluating their trade-offs between privacy and task performance.

To address these challenges, we propose SpatialMath, a novel Spatial Comprehension-Infused Symbolic Reasoning Framework designed to integrate spatial representations into structured symbolic reasoning chains. SpatialMath employs a specialized perception module to extract spatially-grounded representations from visual diagrams, capturing critical geometric structures and spatial relationships. These representations are then methodically infused into symbolic reasoning chains, facilitating visual comprehension-aware structured reasoning. To this end, we introduce MATHVERSE-PLUS, a novel dataset containing structured visual interpretations and step-by-step reasoning paths for vision-intensive mathematical problems. SpatialMath significantly outperforms strong multimodal baselines, achieving up to 10 percentage points improvement over supervised fine-tuning with data augmentation in vision-intensive settings. Robustness analysis reveals that enhanced spatial representations directly improve reasoning accuracy, reinforcing the need for structured perception-to-reasoning pipelines in MSLMs."}

When these systems fail, the problem is often not the language model itself, but that the nearest neighbors in the embedding space correspond to the wrong cases. Modern machine learning systems increasingly rely on fixed, high-dimensional embeddings produced by large pretrained models and sentence encoders. In real-world deployments, labels are scarce, domains shift over time, and retraining the base encoder is expensive or infeasible. As a result, downstream performance depends heavily on embedding geometry. Yet raw embeddings are often poorly aligned with the local neighborhood structure required by nearest-neighbor retrieval, similarity search, and lightweight classifiers that operate directly on embeddings. We propose PEARL (Prototype-Enhanced Aligned Representation Learning), a label-efficient approach that uses limited supervision to softly align embeddings toward class prototypes. The method reshapes local neighborhood geometry while preserving dimensionality and avoiding aggressive projection or collapse. Its aim is to bridge the gap between purely unsupervised post-processing, which offers limited and inconsistent gains, and fully supervised projections that require substantial labeled data. We evaluate PEARL under controlled label regimes ranging from extreme label scarcity to higher-label settings. In the label-scarce condition, PEARL substantially improves local neighborhood quality, yielding 25.7% gains over raw embeddings and more than 21.1% gains relative to strong unsupervised post-processing, precisely in the regime where similarity-based systems are most brittle."}

Existing LSR approaches have relied almost exclusively on uncased backbone models, whose vocabularies exclude case-sensitive distinctions, thereby reducing vocabulary mismatch.

Despite this shift, the impact of backbone model casing on LSR has not been studied, potentially posing a risk to the viability of the method going forward. To fill this gap, we systematically evaluate paired cased and uncased versions of the same backbone models across multiple datasets to assess their suitability for LSR. Our findings show that LSR models with cased backbone models by default perform substantially worse than their uncased counterparts; however, this gap can be eliminated by pre-processing the text to lowercase. Moreover, our token-level analysis reveals that, under lowercasing, cased models almost entirely suppress cased vocabulary items and behave effectively as uncased models, explaining their restored performance. This result broadens the applicability of recent cased models to the LSR setting and facilitates the integration of stronger backbone architectures into sparse retrieval.

Language models trained on human-generated text inevitably encounter these hierarchical patterns embedded in language, raising the question of whether they might reproduce such dynamics in multi-agent settings. This thesis investigates when and how language models form status hierarchies by adapting Berger et al.'s (1972) expectation states framework. I create multi-agent scenarios where separate language model instances complete sentiment classification tasks, are introduced with varying status characteristics (e.g., credentials, expertise), then have opportunities to revise their initial judgments after observing their partner's responses. The dependent variable is deference, the rate at which models shift their ratings toward their partner's position based on status cues rather than task information. Results show that language models form significant status hierarchies when capability is equal (35 percentage point asymmetry, p < .001), but capability differences dominate status cues, with the most striking effect being that high-status assignments reduce higher-capability models' deference rather than increasing lower-capability models' deference. The implications for AI safety are significant: status-seeking behavior could introduce deceptive strategies, amplify discriminatory biases, and scale across distributed deployments far faster than human hierarchies form organically. This work identifies emergent social behaviors in AI systems and highlights a previously underexplored dimension of the alignment challenge."}

This paper presents a large-scale log analysis of agentic search based on 14.44M search requests (3.97M sessions) collected from DeepResearchGym, i.e. an open-source search API accessed by external agentic clients. We sessionize the logs, assign session-level intents and step-wise query-reformulation labels using LLM-based annotation, and propose Context-driven Term Adoption Rate (CTAR) to quantify whether newly introduced query terms are traceable to previously retrieved evidence. Our analyses reveal distinctive behavioral patterns. First, over 90% of multi-turn sessions contain at most ten steps, and 89% of inter-step intervals fall under one minute. Second, behavior varies by intent. Fact-seeking sessions exhibit high repetition that increases over time, while sessions requiring reasoning sustain broader exploration. Third, agents reuse evidence across steps. On average, 54% of newly introduced query terms appear in the accumulated evidence context, with contributions from earlier steps beyond the most recent retrieval. The findings suggest that agentic search may benefit from repetition-aware early stopping, intent-adaptive retrieval budgets, and explicit cross-step context tracking.

By storing these \"memories,\" Memento discovers connections between users' recurring interests and the contexts that trigger them. Upon detection of similar or identical spatiotemporal activity, Memento proactively recalls user interests and delivers up-to-date responses through AR, seamlessly integrating AR experience into their daily routine. Unlike prior work, each interaction in Memento is not a transient event, but a connected series of interactions with coherent long--term perspective, tailored to the user's broader multimodal (visual, spatial, temporal, and embodied) context. We conduct preliminary evaluation through user feedbacks with participants of diverse expertise in immersive apps, and explore the value of proactive context-aware AR assistant in everyday settings. We share our findings and challenges in designing a proactive, context-aware AR system."}

To examine whether AI models can understand such signals in human cultural contexts, we introduce AVMeme Exam, a human-curated benchmark of over one thousand iconic Internet sounds and videos spanning speech, songs, music, and sound effects. Each meme is paired with a unique Q&A assessing levels of understanding from surface content to context and emotion to usage and world knowledge, along with metadata such as original year, transcript, summary, and sensitivity. We systematically evaluate state-of-the-art multimodal large language models (MLLMs) alongside human participants using this benchmark. Our results reveal a consistent limitation: current models perform poorly on textless music and sound effects, and struggle to think in context and in culture compared to surface content.

Our approach introduces lightweight sink-attention gating modules to identify and retain critical KV pairs, and integrates seamlessly into both the prefill and decoding stages. The proposed gate training algorithm relies on forward passes of an LLM, avoiding expensive backpropagation, while achieving strong task generalization through a task-agnostic reconstruction objective.

To stabilize training while increasing the number of experts, we propose $\\infty$-MoE that selects a portion of the parameters of large FFNs based on continuous values sampled for each token. By considering experts in a continuous space, this approach allows for an infinite number of experts while maintaining computational efficiency.

These characteristics make it difficult for conventional retrieval-augmented generation pipelines to recover the statutory elements required for accurate retrieval. Dense retrievers focus primarily on the literal surface form of the query, whereas lightweight rerankers lack the legal-reasoning capacity needed to assess statutory applicability. We present LegalMALR, a retrieval framework that integrates a Multi-Agent Query Understanding System (MAS) with a zero-shot large-language-model-based reranking module (LLM Reranker). MAS generates diverse, legally grounded reformulations and conducts iterative dense retrieval to broaden candidate coverage. To stabilise the stochastic behaviour of LLM-generated rewrites, we optimise a unified MAS policy using Generalized Reinforcement Policy Optimization(GRPO). The accumulated candidate set is subsequently evaluated by the LLM Reranker, which performs natural-language legal reasoning to produce the final ranking. We further construct CSAID, a dataset of 118 difficult Chinese legal queries annotated with multiple statutory labels, and evaluate LegalMALR on both CSAID and the public STARD benchmark. Experiments show that LegalMALR substantially outperforms strong Retrieval-augmented generation(RAG) baselines in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining multi-perspective query interpretation, reinforcement-based policy optimisation, and large-model reranking for statute retrieval."}

We argue this gap stems largely from the prevailing single-pass paradigm, which lacks the iterative reasoning, schema exploration, and error-correction behaviors that humans naturally employ. To address this limitation, we introduce SQL-Trail, a multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) agentic framework for Text-to-SQL. Rather than producing a query in one shot, SQL-Trail interacts with the database environment and uses execution feedback to iteratively refine its predictions. Our approach centers on two key ideas: (i) an adaptive turn-budget allocation mechanism that scales the agent's interaction depth to match question difficulty, and (ii) a composite reward panel that jointly incentivizes SQL correctness and efficient exploration. Across benchmarks, SQL-Trail sets a new state of the art and delivers strong data efficiency--up to 18x higher than prior single-pass RL state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our 7B and 14B models outperform substantially larger proprietary systems by 5% on average, underscoring the effectiveness of interactive, agentic workflows for robust Text-to-SQL generation."}

While a sequence of omni MLLMs has emerged, most existing systems still rely on additional expert components to achieve multimodal generation, limiting the simplicity of unified training and inference. Autoregressive (AR) modeling, with a single token stream, a single next-token objective, and a single decoder, is an elegant and scalable foundation in the text domain. Motivated by this, we present AR-Omni, a unified any-to-any model in the autoregressive paradigm without any expert decoders. AR-Omni supports autoregressive text and image generation, as well as streaming speech generation, all under a single Transformer decoder. We further address three practical issues in unified AR modeling: modality imbalance via task-aware loss reweighting, visual fidelity via a lightweight token-level perceptual alignment loss for image tokens, and stability-creativity trade-offs via a finite-state decoding mechanism. Empirically, AR-Omni achieves strong quality across three modalities while remaining real-time, achieving a 0.88 real-time factor for speech generation."}

Specifically, they suffer from spatial redundancy by modeling informative-sparse suffix regions uniformly and temporal inefficiency by applying fixed denoising schedules across all the decoding process. To address this, we propose Streaming-dLLM, a training-free framework that streamlines inference across both spatial and temporal dimensions. Spatially, we introduce attenuation guided suffix modeling to approximate the full context by pruning redundant mask tokens. Temporally, we employ a dynamic confidence aware strategy with an early exit mechanism, allowing the model to skip unnecessary iterations for converged tokens.

To bridge this gap, we present the first comprehensive examination of diverse DPO variants within the medical domain, evaluating nine distinct formulations across two medical LVLMs: LLaVA-Med and HuatuoGPT-Vision. Our results reveal several critical limitations: current DPO approaches often yield inconsistent gains over supervised fine-tuning, with their efficacy varying significantly across different tasks and backbones. Furthermore, they frequently fail to resolve fundamental visual misinterpretation errors. Building on these insights, we present a targeted preference construction strategy as a proof-of-concept that explicitly addresses visual misinterpretation errors frequently observed in existing DPO models. This design yields a 3.6% improvement over the strongest existing DPO baseline on visual question-answering tasks.

Gains are model-dependent: believability increases for higher-capacity models but can drop for smaller ones, and emotion-awareness can mildly reduce adherence to social norms, reflecting a human-like tension between emotion-driven behavior and rule compliance in social simulation.

To address this, we introduce DeepPlanning, a challenging benchmark for practical long-horizon agent planning. It features multi-day travel planning and multi-product shopping tasks that require proactive information acquisition, local constrained reasoning, and global constrained optimization. Evaluations on DeepPlanning show that even frontier agentic LLMs struggle with these problems, highlighting the importance of reliable explicit reasoning patterns and parallel tool use for achieving better effectiveness-efficiency trade-offs. Error analysis further points to promising directions for improving agentic LLMs over long planning horizons. We open-source the code and data to support future research."}

This article introduces a shared dataset of 1446 short texts, each of which describes a research quality score on the UK scale of 1* to 4*. This is a messy collection, with some texts not containing scores and others including invalid scores or strange formats. With this dataset there is also a description of what constitutes a valid score and a \"gold standard\" of the correct scores for these texts (including missing values). The challenge is to design a prompt for Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract the scores from these texts as accurately as possible. The format for the response should be a number and no other text so there are two aspects to the challenge: ensuring that the LLM returns only a number, and instructing it to deduce the correct number for the text. As part of this, the LLM prompt needs to explain when to return the missing value code, -1, instead of a number when the text does not clearly contain one. The article also provides an example of a simple prompt. The purpose of the challenge is twofold: to get an effective solution to this problem, and to increase understanding of prompt design and LLM capabilities for complex numerical tasks.

To address these limitations, we propose Think-Augmented Function Calling (TAFC), a novel framework that enhances function calling accuracy through explicit reasoning at both function and parameter levels. Our method introduces a universal \"think\" parameter augmentation that enables models to articulate their decision-making process, with dynamic optimization for parameter descriptions to improve reasoning quality.

Beyond simple label prediction, robust affective reasoning must synthesize fine-grained signals such as facial micro-expressions and prosodic which shifts to decode the latent causality within complex social contexts. However, current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) face significant limitations in fine-grained perception, primarily due to data scarcity and insufficient cross-modal fusion. As a result, these models often exhibit unimodal dominance which leads to hallucinations in complex multimodal interactions, particularly when visual and acoustic cues are subtle, ambiguous, or even contradictory (e.g., in sarcastic scenery). To address this, we introduce SABER-LLM, a framework designed for robust multimodal reasoning. First, we construct SABER, a large-scale emotion reasoning dataset comprising 600K video clips, annotated with a novel six-dimensional schema that jointly captures audiovisual cues and causal logic. Second, we propose the structured evidence decomposition paradigm, which enforces a \"perceive-then-reason\" separation between evidence extraction and reasoning to alleviate unimodal dominance. The ability to perceive complex scenes is further reinforced by consistency-aware direct preference optimization, which explicitly encourages alignment among modalities under ambiguous or conflicting perceptual conditions. Experiments on EMER, EmoBench-M, and SABER-Test demonstrate that SABER-LLM significantly outperforms open-source baselines and achieves robustness competitive with closed-source models in decoding complex emotional dynamics. The dataset and model are available at https://github.com/zxzhao0/SABER-LLM."}

Based on blind pairwise comparisons by 28 expert judges and 131 lay judges, we find that experts preferred human writing in 82.7% of cases under the in-context prompting condition but this reversed to 62% preference for AI after fine-tuning on authors' complete works. Lay judges, however, consistently preferred AI writing. Debrief interviews with expert writers revealed that their preference for AI writing triggered an identity crisis, eroding aesthetic confidence and questioning what constitutes \"good writing.\" These findings challenge discourse about AI's creative limitations and raise fundamental questions about the future of creative labor."}

In this work, we analyze how stabilizing training dynamics affects the induced generation distribution. We show that under standard maximum likelihood training, stable parameter trajectories lead stationary solutions to approximately minimize the forward KL divergence to the empirical distribution, while implicitly reducing generative entropy. As a consequence, the learned model can concentrate probability mass on a limited subset of empirical modes, exhibiting systematic degeneration despite smooth loss convergence. We empirically validate this effect using a controlled feedback-based training framework that stabilizes internal generation statistics, observing consistent low-entropy outputs and repetitive behavior across architectures and random seeds. It indicates that optimization stability and generative expressivity are not inherently aligned, and that stability alone is an insufficient indicator of generative quality."}

Our results show that both speech- and text-based models follow a sequence of learning stages: during training, their neural activations successively build subspaces, where the geometry of the neural activations represents phonemic, lexical, and syntactic structure. While this developmental trajectory qualitatively relates to children's, it is quantitatively different: These algorithms indeed require two to four orders of magnitude more data for these neural representations to emerge. Together, these results show conditions under which major stages of language acquisition spontaneously emerge, and hence delineate a promising path to understand the computations underpinning language acquisition."}

Effective reasoning, therefore, hinges on knowing which tools to use, when to invoke them, and how to compose them over multiple steps, even when faced with new tools or new tasks. We introduce \\textbf{AdaReasoner}, a family of multimodal models that learn tool use as a general reasoning skill rather than as tool-specific or explicitly supervised behavior. AdaReasoner is enabled by (i) a scalable data curation pipeline exposing models to long-horizon, multi-step tool interactions; (ii) Tool-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that optimizes tool selection and sequencing based on end-task success; and (iii) an adaptive learning mechanism that dynamically regulates tool usage. Together, these components allow models to infer tool utility from task context and intermediate outcomes, enabling coordination of multiple tools and generalization to unseen tools. Empirically, AdaReasoner exhibits strong tool-adaptive and generalization behaviors: it autonomously adopts beneficial tools, suppresses irrelevant ones, and adjusts tool usage frequency based on task demands, despite never being explicitly trained to do so. These capabilities translate into state-of-the-art performance across challenging benchmarks, improving the 7B base model by +24.9\\% on average and surpassing strong proprietary systems such as GPT-5 on multiple tasks, including VSP and Jigsaw."}

Here, we present a comprehensive mechanistic analysis of catastrophic forgetting in transformer-based LLMs during sequential fine-tuning. Through systematic experiments across multiple model scales (109B to 400B total parameters) and task sequences, we identify three primary mechanisms driving forgetting: gradient interference in attention weights, representational drift in intermediate layers, and loss landscape flattening. We demonstrate that forgetting severity correlates strongly with task similarity (Pearson r = 0.87) and gradient alignment metrics. Our analysis reveals that approximately 15 to 23 percent of attention heads undergo severe disruption during fine-tuning, with lower layers showing greater susceptibility.

However, on-policy distillation typically requires a separate, often larger, teacher LLM and does not explicitly leverage ground-truth solutions available in reasoning datasets. Inspired by the intuition that a sufficiently capable LLM can rationalize external privileged reasoning traces and teach its weaker self (i.e., the version without access to privileged information), we introduce On-Policy Self-Distillation (OPSD), a framework where a single model acts as both teacher and student by conditioning on different contexts. The teacher policy conditions on privileged information (e.g., verified reasoning traces) while the student policy sees only the question; training minimizes the per-token divergence between these distributions over the student's own rollouts. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, achieving 4-8x token efficiency compared to reinforcement learning methods such as GRPO and superior performance over off-policy distillation methods."}

We extend the Inverse Constitutional AI (ICAI) approach to generate contextual principles from human preference annotation data by leveraging human-provided \\textit{reasons} for their preferences. We supplement these contextual principles with general principles surfaced from user statements of \\textit{values} regarding AI.

Our method requires as few as 100 human-annotated queries and 10,000 unlabeled examples, reducing annotation requirements significantly compared to traditional approaches.

Reinforcement learning methods for finetuning large reasoning models stall on datasets with low initial success rates, and thus little training signal.

To explore this, we design SOAR: A self-improvement framework designed to surface these pedagogical signals through meta-RL. A teacher copy of the model proposes synthetic problems for a student copy, and is rewarded with its improvement on a small subset of hard problems. Critically, SOAR grounds the curriculum in measured student progress rather than intrinsic proxy rewards. Our study on the hardest subsets of mathematical benchmarks (0/128 success) reveals three core findings. First, we show that it is possible to realize bi-level meta-RL that unlocks learning under sparse, binary rewards by sharpening a latent capacity of pretrained models to generate useful stepping stones. Second, grounded rewards outperform intrinsic reward schemes used in prior LLM self-play, reliably avoiding the instability and diversity collapse modes they typically exhibit. Third, analyzing the generated questions reveals that structural quality and well-posedness are more critical for learning progress than solution correctness. Our results suggest that the ability to generate useful stepping stones does not require the preexisting ability to actually solve the hard problems, paving a principled path to escape reasoning plateaus without additional curated data."}

On hard problems, on-policy RL rarely explores even a single correct rollout, yielding zero reward and no learning signal for driving improvement. We find that natural solutions to remedy this exploration problem from classical RL, such as entropy bonuses, more permissive clipping of the importance ratio, or direct optimization of pass@k objectives, do not resolve this issue and often destabilize optimization without improving solvability. A natural alternative is to leverage transfer from easier problems. However, we show that mixing easy and hard problems during RL training is counterproductive due to ray interference, where optimization focuses on already-solvable problems in a way that actively inhibits progress on harder ones. To address this challenge, we introduce Privileged On-Policy Exploration (POPE), an approach that leverages human- or other oracle solutions as privileged information to guide exploration on hard problems, unlike methods that use oracle solutions as training targets (e.g., off-policy RL methods or warmstarting from SFT). POPE augments hard problems with prefixes of oracle solutions, enabling RL to obtain non-zero rewards during guided rollouts. Crucially, the resulting behaviors transfer back to the original, unguided problems through a synergy between instruction-following and reasoning. Empirically, POPE expands the set of solvable problems and substantially improves performance on challenging reasoning benchmarks."}

To bootstrap more efficient RL, we consider reusing old sampling FLOPs (from prior inference or RL training) in the form of off-policy traces. Standard off-policy methods supervise against off-policy data, causing instabilities during RL optimization. We introduce PrefixRL, where we condition on the prefix of successful off-policy traces and run on-policy RL to complete them, side-stepping off-policy instabilities. PrefixRL boosts the learning signal on hard problems by modulating the difficulty of the problem through the off-policy prefix length. We prove that the PrefixRL objective is not only consistent with the standard RL objective but also more sample efficient. Empirically, we discover back-generalization: training only on prefixed problems generalizes to out-of-distribution unprefixed performance, with learned strategies often differing from those in the prefix. In our experiments, we source the off-policy traces by rejection sampling with the base model, creating a self-improvement loop. On hard reasoning problems, PrefixRL reaches the same training reward 2x faster than the strongest baseline (SFT on off-policy data then RL), even after accounting for the compute spent on the initial rejection sampling, and increases the final reward by 3x. The gains transfer to held-out benchmarks, and PrefixRL is still effective when off-policy traces are derived from a different model family, validating its flexibility in practical settings."}
