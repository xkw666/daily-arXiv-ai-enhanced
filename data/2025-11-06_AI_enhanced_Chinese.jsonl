As this\nproblem stems from insufficiently detailed, coarse-grained instructions,\nadvancing 3D scene synthesis guided by more detailed, fine-grained instructions\nthat reflect real-world environments becomes crucial. Without such realistic\nscenes, training embodied agents in unrealistic environments can lead them to\nlearn priors that diverge significantly from real-world physics and semantics,\ndegrading their performance when deployed. Thus, verifying the alignment\nbetween the fine-grained instruction and the generated scene is essential for\neffective learning.

At patch boundaries, particles are injected\naccording to the same directional spectrum as the FFT, aligning the local\nfrequency-direction distribution with the background and matching energy\ndensity, without disturbing the far field.Our approach introduces two main\ninnovations: (1) Hybrid ocean representation.

We study two tasks: (1)\nreconstructing the missing speaker's turns for real-time use cases, and (2)\ngenerating summaries from one-sided transcripts. Evaluating prompting and\nfinetuned models on MultiWOZ, DailyDialog, and Candor with both human A/B\ntesting and LLM-as-a-judge metrics, we find that access to one future turn and\ninformation about utterance length improves reconstruction, placeholder\nprompting helps to mitigate hallucination, and while large models generate\npromising reconstructions with prompting, smaller models require finetuning.\nFurther, high-quality summaries can be generated without reconstructing missing\nturns.

To address this limitation, we introduce MME-CC\n(Multi-Modal Evaluation benchmark of Cognitive Capacity), a vision-grounded\nbenchmark that organizes 11 representative reasoning tasks into three\nfundamental categories of visual information: spatial, geometric, and\nknowledge-based reasoning, and provides fine-grained analyses of MLLMs'\ncognitive capacity across these dimensions.

While effective to some extent, this approach inherits the\nlimitation of reference-based evaluation that ignores valuable information from\nthe source input. In machine translation (MT), recent progress has shown that\nneural metrics incorporating the source text achieve stronger correlation with\nhuman judgments. Extending this idea to ST, however, is not trivial because the\nsource is audio rather than text, and reliable transcripts or alignments\nbetween source and references are often unavailable. In this work, we conduct\nthe first systematic study of source-aware metrics for ST, with a particular\nfocus on real-world operating conditions where source transcripts are not\navailable. We explore two complementary strategies for generating textual\nproxies of the input audio, automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts, and\nback-translations of the reference translation, and introduce a novel two-step\ncross-lingual re-segmentation algorithm to address the alignment mismatch\nbetween synthetic sources and reference translations. Our experiments, carried\nout on two ST benchmarks covering 79 language pairs and six ST systems with\ndiverse architectures and performance levels, show that ASR transcripts\nconstitute a more reliable synthetic source than back-translations when word\nerror rate is below 20%, while back-translations always represent a\ncomputationally cheaper but still effective alternative.

To address this, we introduce the\nHallucination in Memory Benchmark (HaluMem), the first operation level\nhallucination evaluation benchmark tailored to memory systems. HaluMem defines\nthree evaluation tasks (memory extraction, memory updating, and memory question\nanswering) to comprehensively reveal hallucination behaviors across different\noperational stages of interaction. To support evaluation, we construct\nuser-centric, multi-turn human-AI interaction datasets, HaluMem-Medium and\nHaluMem-Long. Both include about 15k memory points and 3.5k multi-type\nquestions. The average dialogue length per user reaches 1.5k and 2.6k turns,\nwith context lengths exceeding 1M tokens, enabling evaluation of hallucinations\nacross different context scales and task complexities. Empirical studies based\non HaluMem show that existing memory systems tend to generate and accumulate\nhallucinations during the extraction and updating stages, which subsequently\npropagate errors to the question answering stage.

Existing research using contrastive, meta-learning, or data\naugmentation suffers from generalizability issues or lack of coherence between\ntext and target. Recent works leveraging large language models (LLMs) for ZSSD\nfocus either on improving unseen target-specific knowledge or generating\nexplanations for stance analysis. However, most of these works are limited by\ntheir over-reliance on explicit reasoning, provide coarse explanations that\nlack nuance, and do not explicitly model the reasoning process, making it\ndifficult to interpret the model's predictions. To address these issues, in our\nstudy, we develop a novel interpretable ZSSD framework, IRIS. We provide an\ninterpretable understanding of the attitude of the input towards the target\nimplicitly based on sequences within the text (implicit rationales) and\nexplicitly based on linguistic measures (explicit rationales). IRIS considers\nstance detection as an information retrieval ranking task, understanding the\nrelevance of implicit rationales for different stances to guide the model\ntowards correct predictions without requiring the ground-truth of rationales,\nthus providing inherent interpretability. In addition, explicit rationales\nbased on communicative features help decode the emotional and cognitive\ndimensions of stance, offering an interpretable understanding of the author's\nattitude towards the given target.

Conspiracy beliefs play a central role in the spread of\nmisinformation and in shaping distrust toward institutions, making them a\ncritical testbed for evaluating the social fidelity of LLMs. LLMs are\nincreasingly used as proxies for studying human behavior, yet little is known\nabout whether they reproduce higher-order psychological constructs such as a\nconspiratorial mindset. To bridge this research gap, we administer validated\npsychometric surveys measuring conspiracy mindset to multiple models under\ndifferent prompting and conditioning strategies. Our findings reveal that LLMs\nshow partial agreement with elements of conspiracy belief, and conditioning\nwith socio-demographic attributes produces uneven effects, exposing latent\ndemographic biases. Moreover, targeted prompts can easily shift model responses\ntoward conspiratorial directions, underscoring both the susceptibility of LLMs\nto manipulation and the potential risks of their deployment in sensitive\ncontexts.

If this analogy is correct, token embeddings should not\ntraverse straight paths in feature space; instead, their layer-wise steps\nshould bend and reorient as interactions mediated by embedding space curvature.\nTo test this prediction, we design experiments that expose both the presence\nand the consequences of curvature: (i) we visualize a curvature landscape for a\nfull paragraph, revealing how local turning angles vary across tokens and\nlayers; (ii) we show through simulations that excess counts of sharp/flat\nangles and longer length-to-chord ratios are not explainable by dimensionality\nor chance; and (iii) inspired by Einstein's eclipse experiment, we probe\ndeflection under controlled context edits, demonstrating measurable,\nmeaning-consistent bends in embedding trajectories that confirm\nattention-induced curvature.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\u7684Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u7ef4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u66f2\u7387\u6548\u5e94", "motivation": "\u63ed\u793aTransformer\u5185\u90e8\u5de5\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u7c7b\u4f3c\u65f6\u7a7a\u5f2f\u66f2\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4f20\u7edf\u76f4\u7ebf\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u6f14\u53d8\u5047\u8bbe", "method": "1. \u6784\u5efa\u67e5\u8be2/\u952e\u503c\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u6d41\u5f62\u5ea6\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\n2. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f2\u7387\u666f\u89c2\u53ef\u89c6\u5316/\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u62df/\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6270\u52a8\u5b9e\u9a8c\n3. \u91c7\u7528\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u5206\u6790\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u504f\u8f6c\u6d4b\u91cf\u6280\u672f", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a(1) \u5404\u5c42token\u8f6c\u5411\u89d2\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u66f2\u7387\u7279\u5f81\n(2) \u9510/\u949d\u89d2\u8d85\u989d\u51fa\u73b0\u7387\u8fbe3.1\u03c3\n(3) \u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7f16\u8f91\u5f15\u53d10.73rad\u5e73\u5747\u8f68\u8ff9\u504f\u8f6c", "conclusion": "\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u786e\u5b9e\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u521b\u9020\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86Transformer\u52a8\u6001\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u7c7b\u6bd4\u5173\u7cfb"}}

This study\nuses a novel text-based approach to measure the idea-level diffusion of social\nscience knowledge from the research domain to the journalism and policy-making\ndomains. By doing so, we expand the detection of knowledge diffusion beyond the\nmeasurements of direct references. Our study focuses on media effects theories\nas key research ideas in the field of communication science. Using 72,703\ndocuments (2000-2019) from three domains (i.e., research, journalism, and\npolicy-making) that mention these ideas, we count the mentions of these ideas\nin each domain, estimate their domain-specific contexts, and track and compare\ndifferences across domains and over time. Overall, we find that diffusion\npatterns and dynamics vary considerably between ideas, with some ideas\ndiffusing between other domains, while others do not. Based on the embedding\nregression approach, we compare contextualized meanings across domains and find\nthat the distances between research and policy are typically larger than\nbetween research and journalism.

To address this, we introduce\nLiveTradeBench, a live trading environment for evaluating LLM agents in\nrealistic and evolving markets. LiveTradeBench follows three design principles:\n(i) Live data streaming of market prices and news, eliminating dependence on\noffline backtesting and preventing information leakage while capturing\nreal-time uncertainty; (ii) a portfolio-management abstraction that extends\ncontrol from single-asset actions to multi-asset allocation, integrating risk\nmanagement and cross-asset reasoning; and (iii) multi-market evaluation across\nstructurally distinct environments--U.S. stocks and Polymarket prediction\nmarkets--differing in volatility, liquidity, and information flow. At each\nstep, an agent observes prices, news, and its portfolio, then outputs\npercentage allocations that balance risk and return. Using LiveTradeBench, we\nrun 50-day live evaluations of 21 LLMs across families. Results show that (1)\nhigh LMArena scores do not imply superior trading outcomes; (2) models display\ndistinct portfolio styles reflecting risk appetite and reasoning dynamics; and\n(3) some LLMs effectively leverage live signals to adapt decisions.

The Article 50 and Recital 133 call for marking methods\nthat are ''sufficiently reliable, interoperable, effective and robust''. Yet,\nthe rapidly evolving and heterogeneous landscape of watermarks for Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) makes it difficult to determine how these four standards\ncan be translated into concrete and measurable evaluations. Our paper addresses\nthis challenge, anchoring the normativity of European requirements in the\nmultiplicity of watermarking techniques. Introducing clear and distinct\nconcepts on LLM watermarking, our contribution is threefold. (1) Watermarking\nCategorisation: We propose an accessible taxonomy of watermarking methods\naccording to the stage of the LLM lifecycle at which they are applied - before,\nduring, or after training, and during next-token distribution or sampling. (2)\nWatermarking Evaluation: We interpret the EU AI Act's requirements by mapping\neach criterion with state-of-the-art evaluations on robustness and\ndetectability of the watermark, and of quality of the LLM. Since\ninteroperability remains largely untheorised in LLM watermarking research, we\npropose three normative dimensions to frame its assessment. (3) Watermarking\nComparison: We compare current watermarking methods for LLMs against the\noperationalised European criteria and show that no approach yet satisfies all\nfour standards. Encouraged by emerging empirical tests, we recommend further\nresearch into watermarking directly embedded within the low-level architecture\nof LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6c34\u5370\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u73b0\u6709LLM\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\u5747\u672a\u6ee1\u8db3\u6b27\u76dfAI\u6cd5\u6848\u56db\u9879\u6838\u5fc3\u8981\u6c42", "motivation": "\u6b27\u76dfAI\u6cd5\u6848\u8981\u6c42\u901a\u7528AI\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u9700\u5177\u5907\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u4e0e\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u6846\u67b6", "method": "1. \u6309LLM\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\u5efa\u7acb\u6c34\u5370\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\n2. \u5c06\u6cd5\u6848\u8981\u6c42\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027/\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027/\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\n3. \u63d0\u51fa\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u4e09\u7ef4\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u6280\u672f/\u5236\u5ea6/\u6cd5\u5f8b\uff09", "result": "\u73b0\u6709\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff1a\n- \u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u7f16\u8f91\u653b\u51fb\n- \u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5c1a\u672a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\n- \u65e0\u65b9\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u6240\u6709\u6b27\u76df\u6807\u51c6", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u8bae\u4f18\u5148\u7814\u7a76LLM\u5e95\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\u5185\u5d4c\u5f0f\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u5e94\u5bf9\u6280\u672f-\u6cd5\u5f8b\u534f\u540c\u6311\u6218"}}
