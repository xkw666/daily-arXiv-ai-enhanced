We investigate this gap with an\nextensive suite of controlled experiments and identify a consistent principle:\n\\textit{policy optimization consistently follows the path of least resistance}.\nWhen afforded the flexibility to interleave reasoning and response, policy\noptimization consistently learns to discard explicit reasoning, causing the\npolicy to degenerate to a direct \\texttt{<answer>}-only format. This outcome\nholds true across various models and algorithms. We find that this collapse in\nformat is persistent even when the complex \\texttt{<think><answer>} format is\nassigned up to 4x larger reward weights. We formalize this principle through a\nseries of controlled reward decomposition experiments, demonstrating a clear\nhierarchy: PO systematically optimizes for the simplest reward component first,\na preference that holds even when faced with mutually exclusive choices or\nstrong incentives for more complex behaviors.

Diffusion modeling starts by defining a\nforward process that gradually corrupts data into noise, linking the data\ndistribution to a simple prior through a continuum of intermediate\ndistributions. The goal is to learn a reverse process that transforms noise\nback into data while recovering the same intermediates. We describe three\ncomplementary views. The variational view, inspired by variational\nautoencoders, sees diffusion as learning to remove noise step by step. The\nscore-based view, rooted in energy-based modeling, learns the gradient of the\nevolving data distribution, indicating how to nudge samples toward more likely\nregions. The flow-based view, related to normalizing flows, treats generation\nas following a smooth path that moves samples from noise to data under a\nlearned velocity field. These perspectives share a common backbone: a\ntime-dependent velocity field whose flow transports a simple prior to the data.\nSampling then amounts to solving a differential equation that evolves noise\ninto data along a continuous trajectory.

A critical factor in building such\nassistants is personalizing LLMs, as user preferences and needs vary widely.\nActivation steering, which directly leverages directions representing user\npreference in the LLM activation space to adjust its behavior, offers a\ncost-effective way to align the model's outputs with individual users. However,\nexisting methods rely on all historical data to compute the steering vector,\nignoring that not all content reflects true user preferences, which undermines\nthe personalization signal. To address this, we propose SteerX, a disentangled\nsteering method that isolates preference-driven components from\npreference-agnostic components. Grounded in causal inference theory, SteerX\nestimates token-level causal effects to identify preference-driven tokens,\ntransforms these discrete signals into a coherent description, and then\nleverages them to steer personalized LLM generation. By focusing on the truly\npreference-driven information, SteerX produces more accurate activation\nsteering vectors and enhances personalization.

While Large Language\nModels (LLMs) show great potential in creative writing, direct end-to-end\ngeneration approaches often fail to produce well-crafted screenplays. We argue\nthis failure stems from forcing a single model to simultaneously master two\ndisparate capabilities: creative narrative construction and rigid format\nadherence. The resulting outputs may mimic superficial style but lack the deep\nstructural integrity and storytelling substance required for professional use.\nTo enable LLMs to generate high-quality screenplays, we introduce Dual-Stage\nRefinement (DSR), a decomposed framework that decouples creative narrative\ngeneration from format conversion. The first stage transforms a brief outline\ninto rich, novel-style prose. The second stage refines this narrative into a\nprofessionally formatted screenplay. This separation enables the model to\nspecialize in one distinct capability at each stage. A key challenge in\nimplementing DSR is the scarcity of paired outline-to-novel training data. We\naddress this through hybrid data synthesis: reverse synthesis deconstructs\nexisting screenplays into structured inputs, while forward synthesis leverages\nthese inputs to generate high-quality narrative texts as training targets.\nBlind evaluations by professional screenwriters show that DSR achieves a 75%\nwin rate against strong baselines like Gemini-2.5-Pro and reaches 82.7% of\nhuman-level performance.

Larger UAV platforms introduce distinct\nchallenges, including stringent requirements for airport-based take-off and\nlanding procedures, adherence to complex regulatory frameworks, and specialized\noperational capabilities with elevated mission expectations. This position\npaper presents the Next-Generation LLM for UAV (NeLV) system -- a comprehensive\ndemonstration and automation roadmap for integrating LLMs into multi-scale UAV\noperations. The NeLV system processes natural language instructions to\norchestrate short-, medium-, and long-range UAV missions through five key\ntechnical components: (i) LLM-as-Parser for instruction interpretation, (ii)\nRoute Planner for Points of Interest (POI) determination, (iii) Path Planner\nfor waypoint generation, (iv) Control Platform for executable trajectory\nimplementation, and (v) UAV monitoring. We demonstrate the system's feasibility\nthrough three representative use cases spanning different operational scales:\nmulti-UAV patrol, multi-POI delivery, and multi-hop relocation. Beyond the\ncurrent implementation, we establish a five-level automation taxonomy that\ncharts the evolution from current LLM-as-Parser capabilities (Level 1) to fully\nautonomous LLM-as-Autopilot systems (Level 5), identifying technical\nprerequisites and research challenges at each stage."}

Current vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle on basic data\nvisualization understanding tasks, but the causes of failure remain unclear.\nAre VLM failures attributable to limitations in how visual information in the\ndata visualization is encoded, how information is transferred between the\nvision and language modules, or how information is processed within the\nlanguage module? We developed FUGU, a suite of data visualization understanding\ntasks, to precisely characterize potential sources of difficulty (e.g.,\nextracting the position of data points, distances between them, and other\nsummary statistics). We used FUGU to investigate three widely used VLMs. To\ndiagnose the sources of errors produced by these models, we used activation\npatching and linear probes to trace information flow through models across a\nvariety of prompting strategies. We found that some models fail to generate the\ncoordinates of individual data points correctly, and these initial errors often\nlead to erroneous final responses. When these models are provided with the\ncorrect coordinates, performance improves substantially. Moreover, even when\nthe model generates an incorrect response, the correct coordinates can be\nsuccessfully read out from the latent representations in the vision encoder,\nsuggesting that the source of these errors lies in the vision-language handoff.\nWe further found that while providing correct coordinates helps with tasks\ninvolving one or a small number of data points, it generally worsens\nperformance for tasks that require extracting statistical relationships across\nmany data points. Fine-tuning models on FUGU also fails to yield ceiling\nperformance.

To facilitate the development of MLLMs unlearning and\nalleviate the aforementioned limitations, we introduce OFFSIDE, a novel\nbenchmark for evaluating misinformation unlearning in MLLMs based on football\ntransfer rumors.

OFFSIDE supports\nadvanced settings like selective unlearning and corrective relearning, and\ncrucially, unimodal unlearning (forgetting only text data). Our extensive\nevaluation of multiple baselines reveals key findings: (1) Unimodal methods\n(erasing text-based knowledge) fail on multimodal rumors; (2) Unlearning\nefficacy is largely driven by catastrophic forgetting; (3) All methods struggle\nwith \"visual rumors\" (rumors appear in the image); (4) The unlearned rumors can\nbe easily recovered and (5) All methods are vulnerable to prompt attacks.

Yet, no existing benchmarks offer a systematic and comprehensive\nevaluation of this sensitivity. We introduce ISA-Bench, a dynamic benchmark\nevaluating instruction sensitivity for LALMs along three axes: instruction\ndescription, output format, and task composition. We assess recent open-source\nand proprietary LALMs using ISA-Bench, profiling both compliance and accuracy\nunder controlled instruction variations. Experimental results reveal that even\nstate-of-the-art LALMs suffer significant instruction sensitivity, leading to\ndegraded performance on fundamental audio understanding tasks. To mitigate this\nissue, we fine-tune Qwen2-Audio on a specifically constructed complex\ninstruction-variant dataset, achieving a marked improvement in\ninstruction-following performance.

This limitation stems from existing\nparadigms that enforce a rigid separation between high-level planning and\nlow-level action, which impairs dynamic adaptability and limits generalization.\nWe propose ReCode (Recursive Code Generation), a novel paradigm that addresses\nthis limitation by unifying planning and action within a single code\nrepresentation.
