Our approach produces nested-dissection-style permutations while significantly reducing permutation runtime overhead. Rather than enforcing strict balance and separator optimality, the algorithm deliberately relaxes these design decisions to favor fast partitioning and efficient elimination-tree construction. Our method decomposes permutation into patch-level local orderings and a compact quotient-graph ordering of separators, preserving the essential structure required by sparse Cholesky factorization while avoiding its most expensive components. We integrate our algorithm into vendor-maintained sparse Cholesky solvers on both CPUs and GPUs. Across a range of graphics applications, including single factorizations, repeated factorizations, our method reduces permutation time and improves the sparse Cholesky solve performance by up to 6.27x."}

For a genus-0 closed surface, many efficient algorithms can map the surface to the sphere; consequently, a broad class of task-driven genus-0 mapping problems can be reduced to constructing a high-quality spherical self-map. However, existing approaches often face a trade-off between satisfying task objectives (e.g., landmark or feature alignment), maintaining bijectivity, and controlling geometric distortion. We introduce the Spherical Beltrami Differential (SBD), a two-chart representation of quasiconformal self-maps of the sphere, and establish its correspondence with spherical homeomorphisms up to conformal automorphisms. Building on the Spectral Beltrami Network (SBN), we propose a neural optimization framework BOOST that optimizes two Beltrami fields on hemispherical stereographic charts and enforces global consistency through explicit seam-aware constraints. Experiments on large-deformation landmark matching and intensity-based spherical registration demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. We further apply the method to brain cortical surface registration, aligning sulcal landmarks and jointly matching cortical sulci depth maps, showing improved task fidelity with controlled distortion and robust bijective behavior."}

Existing approaches attempt to recover occluded facial expressions using additional sensors or internal cameras, but sensor-based methods increase device weight and discomfort, while camera-based methods raise privacy concerns and suffer from limited access to raw data. To overcome these limitations, we leverage the blendshape signals provided by commercial VR headsets as expression inputs. Our framework consists of three key components: (1) Blendshape Distribution Alignment (BDA), which applies linear regression to align the headset-provided blendshape distribution to a canonical input space; (2) an Expression Parameter Mapper (EPM) that maps the aligned blendshape signals into an expression parameter space for controlling Gaussian head avatars; and (3) a Mapper-integrated Avatar (MiA) that incorporates EPM into the avatar learning process to ensure distributional consistency. Furthermore, OFERA establishes an end-to-end pipeline that senses and maps expressions, updates Gaussian avatars, and renders them in real-time within VR environments. We show that EPM outperforms existing mapping methods on quantitative metrics, and we demonstrate through a user study that the full OFERA framework enhances expression fidelity while preserving avatar realism. By enabling real-time and photorealistic avatar expression control, OFERA significantly improves telepresence in VR communication.

However, existing approaches are fundamentally constrained by the ``Memory Wall,'' restricting practical deployments to low resolutions (e.g., $64 \\times 64$). This paper bridges the gap between generative models and high-resolution neural simulations by introducing a scalable \\textit{Hardware-Algorithm Co-Design} framework. We identify that high-resolution generation suffers from a critical resource mismatch: the World Model is compute-bound while the Decoder is memory-bound. To address this, we propose a heterogeneous architecture that intelligently decouples these components across a cluster of AI accelerators. Our system features three core innovations: (1) an asymmetric resource allocation strategy that optimizes throughput under sequence parallelism constraints; (2) a memory-centric operator fusion scheme that minimizes off-chip bandwidth usage; and (3) a manifold-aware latent extrapolation mechanism that exploits temporal redundancy to mask latency. We validate our approach on a cluster of programmable AI accelerators, enabling real-time generation at $720 \\times 480$ resolution -- a $50\\times$ increase in pixel throughput over prior baselines. Evaluated on both continuous 3D racing and discrete 2D platformer benchmarks, our system delivers fluid 26.4 FPS and 48.3 FPS respectively, with an amortized effective latency of 2.7 ms. This work demonstrates that resolving the ``Memory Wall'' via architectural co-design is not merely an optimization, but a prerequisite for enabling high-fidelity, responsive neural gameplay."}

To address this, we propose PPoGA (Predictive Plan-on-Graph with Action), a novel KGQA framework inspired by human cognitive control and problem-solving. PPoGA incorporates a Planner-Executor architecture to separate high-level strategy from low-level execution and leverages a Predictive Processing mechanism to anticipate outcomes. The core innovation of our work is a self-correction mechanism that empowers the agent to perform not only Path Correction for local execution errors but also Plan Correction by identifying, discarding, and reformulating the entire plan when it proves ineffective. We conduct extensive experiments on three challenging multi-hop KGQA benchmarks: GrailQA, CWQ, and WebQSP. The results demonstrate that PPoGA achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing methods.

We present Iconix, a human-AI co-creative system that organizes icon generation along two axes: semantic richness (what is depicted) and visual complexity (how much detail). Given a user-specified concept, Iconix constructs a semantic scaffold of related analytical perspectives and employs chained, image-conditioned generation to produce a coherent style of exemplars. Each exemplar is then automatically distilled into a progressive sequence, from detailed and elaborate to abstract and simple. The resulting two-dimensional grid exposes a navigable space, helping designers reason jointly about figurative content and visual abstraction. A within-subjects study (N = 32) found that compared to a baseline workflow, participants produced icon grids more creatively, reported lower workload, and explored a coherent range of design variations. We discuss implications for human-machine co-creative approaches that couple semantic scaffolding with progressive simplification to support visual abstraction."}

This work presents MediGRAF (Medical Graph Retrieval Augmented Framework), a novel hybrid Graph RAG system that bridges this gap. By uniquely combining Neo4j Text2Cypher capabilities for structured relationship traversal with vector embeddings for unstructured narrative retrieval, MediGRAF enables natural language querying of the complete patient journey. Using 10 patients from the MIMIC-IV dataset (generating 5,973 nodes and 5,963 relationships), we generated enough nodes and data for patient level question answering (QA), and we evaluated this architecture across varying query complexities. The system demonstrated 100\\% recall for factual queries which means all relevant information was retrieved and in the output, while complex inference tasks achieved a mean expert quality score of 4.25/5 with zero safety violations.

Our analysis reveals a commonly overlooked limitation of standard RAG systems: they underutilize retrieved context diversity, such that increasing retrieval diversity alone does not yield diverse generations. To address this limitation, we propose DIVERGE, a plug-and-play agentic RAG framework with novel reflection-guided generation and memory-augmented iterative refinement, which promotes diverse viewpoints while preserving answer quality.

We introduce the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating UQ metrics in reasoning-demanding QA studying calibration of UQ methods, providing an extensible open-source framework to reproducibly assess calibration. Our study spans up to 20 large language models of base, instruction-tuned and reasoning variants. Our analysis covers seven scientific QA datasets, including both multiple-choice and arithmetic question answering tasks, using prompting to emulate an open question answering setting. We evaluate and compare methods representative of prominent approaches on a total of 685,000 long-form responses, spanning different reasoning complexities representative of domain-specific tasks. At the token level, we find that instruction tuning induces strong probability mass polarization, reducing the reliability of token-level confidences as estimates of uncertainty. Models further fine-tuned for reasoning are exposed to the same effect, but the reasoning process appears to mitigate it depending on the provider. At the sequence level, we show that verbalized approaches are systematically biased and poorly correlated with correctness, while answer frequency (consistency across samples) yields the most reliable calibration. In the wake of our analysis, we study and report the misleading effect of relying exclusively on ECE as a sole measure for judging performance of UQ methods on benchmark datasets.

However, our work shows that LLMs tend to rely on inherent linguistic patterns, which can override contextual information encoded in the hidden representations during decoding. For example, even when a hidden representation encodes the contextual attribute \"purple\" for \"broccoli\", LLMs still generate \"green\" in their explanations, reflecting a strong prior association. This behavior reveals a systematic unfaithfulness in Patchscopes. To systematically study this issue, we first designed a dataset to evaluate the faithfulness of Patchscopes under biased cases, and our results show that there is an 18.84\\% faithfulness decrease on average. We then propose Bias Alignment through Logit Recalibration (BALOR), which treats the output logits from an unpatched prompt as capturing model bias and contrasts them with logits obtained under patched contextual information. By recalibrating the logit distribution through this contrast, BALOR suppresses model bias and amplifies contextual information during generation. Experiments across multiple LLMs demonstrate that BALOR consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving up to 33\\% relative performance improvement."}

In this paper, we propose a two-stage pipeline for metadata extraction from municipal minutes. First, a question answering (QA) model identifies the opening and closing text segments containing metadata. Transformer-based models (BERTimbau and XLM-RoBERTa with and without a CRF layer) are then applied for fine-grained entity extraction and enhanced through deslexicalization. To evaluate our proposed pipeline, we benchmark both open-weight (Phi) and closed-weight (Gemini) LLMs, assessing predictive performance, inference cost, and carbon footprint. Our results demonstrate strong in-domain performance, better than larger general-purpose LLMs. However, cross-municipality evaluation reveals reduced generalization reflecting the variability and linguistic complexity of municipal records.

We construct a balanced set of 100 sentences that pit local against non-local antecedents for the reflexives kendi and kendisi, and test two contrasting systems: an OpenAI chain-of-thought model designed for multi-step reasoning and Trendyol-LLM-7B-base-v0.1, a LLaMA-2-derived model extensively fine-tuned on Turkish data. Antecedent choice is assessed using a combined sentence-level perplexity and forced-choice paradigm. Trendyol-LLM favours local bindings in approximately 70% of trials, exhibiting a strong locality bias, whereas o1 Mini distributes its choices almost evenly between local and long-distance readings, revealing a marked contrast in binding behaviour across the two systems."}

Such output redundancy is further propagated after supervised finetuning (SFT), as models learn to imitate verbose but uninformative patterns, which can degrade performance. To this end, we incorporate integrated gradient attribution to quantify each token's influence on final answers and aggregate them into two segment-level metrics: (1) \\textit{attribution strength} measures the overall attribution magnitude; and (2) \\textit{direction consistency} captures whether tokens' attributions within a segment are uniformly positive or negative (high consistency), or a mixture of both (moderate consistency). Based on these two metrics, we propose a segment-level selective learning framework to identify important segments with high attribution strength but moderate consistency that indicate reflective rather than shallow reasoning. The framework then applies selective SFT on these important segments while masking loss for unimportant ones. Experiments across multiple models and datasets show that our approach improves accuracy and output efficiency, enabling more effective learning from long reasoning traces~\\footnote{Code and data are available at https://github.com/SiyuanWangw/SegmentSelectiveSFT}."}

However, within these multi-agent systems, the susceptibility of agents to collective cognitive biases remains an underexplored issue. A compelling example is the Mandela effect, a phenomenon where groups collectively misremember past events as a result of false details reinforced through social influence and internalized misinformation. This vulnerability limits our understanding of memory bias in multi-agent systems and raises ethical concerns about the potential spread of misinformation. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on the Mandela effect in LLM-based multi-agent systems, focusing on its existence, causing factors, and mitigation strategies. We propose MANBENCH, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate agent behaviors across four common task types that are susceptible to the Mandela effect, using five interaction protocols that vary in agent roles and memory timescales. We evaluate agents powered by several LLMs on MANBENCH to quantify the Mandela effect and analyze how different factors affect it. Moreover, we propose strategies to mitigate this effect, including prompt-level defenses (e.g., cognitive anchoring and source scrutiny) and model-level alignment-based defense, achieving an average 74.40% reduction in the Mandela effect compared to the baseline. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing more resilient and ethically aligned collaborative multi-agent systems."}

These reveal that LLMs converge on consistent importance patterns, sharply different from pre-LLM baselines, and that LLMs cluster more by family than by size. Computationally, we identify that certain attention heads align well with empirical importance distributions, and that middle-to-late layers are strongly predictive of importance. Together, these results provide initial insights into what LLMs prioritize in summarization and how this priority is internally represented, opening a path toward interpreting and ultimately controlling information selection in these models."}

One such example is revision generation, which requires the generated text to explicitly reflect the writer's actual intentions. Identifying intentions and generating desirable revisions are challenging due to their complex and diverse nature. Although prior work has employed LLMs to generate revisions with few-shot learning, they struggle with handling entangled multi-intent scenarios. While fine-tuning LLMs using intention-based instructions appears promising, it demands large amounts of annotated data, which is expensive and scarce in the revision community. To address these challenges, we propose Intention-Tuning, an intention-adaptive layer-wise LLM fine-tuning framework that dynamically selects a subset of LLM layers to learn the intentions and subsequently transfers their representations to revision generation. Experimental results suggest that Intention-Tuning is effective and efficient on small revision corpora, outperforming several PEFT baselines."}

This creates systematic risks for low-resource languages and culturally marginalized communities, where data practices, model behavior, and accountability mechanisms often fail to align with local norms, rights, and expectations. Drawing on cross-cultural perspectives in human-centered computing and AI governance, this paper synthesizes existing evidence on multilingual model behavior, data asymmetries, and sociotechnical harm, and articulates a culturally grounded governance framework for MLLMs. We identify three interrelated governance challenges: cultural and linguistic inequities in training data and evaluation practices, misalignment between global deployment and locally situated norms, values, and power structures, and limited accountability mechanisms for addressing harms experienced by marginalized language communities. Rather than proposing new technical benchmarks, we contribute a conceptual agenda that reframes multilingual AI governance as a sociocultural and rights based problem. We outline design and policy implications for data stewardship, transparency, and participatory accountability, and argue that culturally grounded governance is essential for ensuring that multilingual language models do not reproduce existing global inequalities under the guise of scale and neutrality."}

However, as probabilistic models, they still struggle to generate syntactically valid outputs reliably. A natural and promising direction to address this issue is to adapt constrained decoding techniques to enforce grammatical correctness during generation. However, applying these techniques faces two primary obstacles. On the one hand, the non-autoregressive nature of dLLMs renders most existing constrained decoding approaches inapplicable. On the other hand, current approaches specifically designed for dLLMs may allow intermediate outputs that are impossible to complete into valid sentences, which significantly limits their reliability in practice.\n  To address these challenges, we present LAVE, a constrained decoding approach specifically designed for dLLMs. Our approach leverages a key property of dLLMs, namely their ability to predict token distributions for all positions in parallel during each forward pass. Whenever a new token is proposed by model, LAVE performs lookahead using these distributions to efficiently and reliably verify the validity of the proposed token. This design ensures reliable constraints by reliably preserving the potential for intermediate outputs to be extended into valid sentences. Extensive experiments across four widely used dLLMs and three representative benchmarks demonstrate that LAVE consistently outperforms existing baselines and achieves substantial improvements in syntactic correctness, while incurring negligible runtime overhead."}

LegalOne is developed through a comprehensive three-phase pipeline designed to master legal reasoning. First, during mid-training phase, we propose Plasticity-Adjusted Sampling (PAS) to address the challenge of domain adaptation. This perplexity-based scheduler strikes a balance between the acquisition of new knowledge and the retention of original capabilities, effectively establishing a robust legal foundation.

To address this, we propose Decouple Searching from Training Mix (DeMix), a novel framework that leverages model merging to predict optimal data ratios. Instead of training proxy models for every sampled mixture, DeMix trains component models on candidate datasets at scale and derives data mixture proxies via weighted model merging. This paradigm decouples search from training costs, enabling evaluation of unlimited sampled mixtures without extra training burden and thus facilitating better mixture discovery through more search trials. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeMix breaks the trade-off between sufficiency, accuracy and efficiency, obtaining the optimal mixture with higher benchmark performance at lower search cost. Additionally, we release the DeMix Corpora, a comprehensive 22T-token dataset comprising high-quality pre-training data with validated mixtures to facilitate open research.

To provide additional information for the RLVR process without relying on a teacher model, we propose A$^2$D, an Adaptive Ability Decomposing method for enhancing the effectiveness of RLVR. Specifically, we first train a decomposer via RLVR without distillation, enabling it to decompose complex questions into a set of simpler sub-questions. Next, we use this decomposer to annotate sub-questions for each question in the training dataset, and then train the reasoner under RLVR with sub-question guidance. To better understand A$^2$D, we first compare its performance with competitive baselines, showing its effectiveness. Next, we observe that our method functions as a plug-and-play module that can be applied to different RLVR algorithms.

We formally define this specific position where the answer first stabilizes as the Reasoning Anchor. By analyzing pre- and post-anchor reasoning behaviors, we uncover the structural redundancy fixed in LRMs: the meaningless repetitive verification after deriving the first complete answer, which we term the Answer-Stable Tail (AST). Motivated by this observation, we propose Anchor-based Process Reward (APR), a structure-aware reward shaping method that localizes the reasoning anchor and penalizes exclusively the post-anchor AST.

A fundamental challenge, however, is how to characterize the level of trust exhibited by an AI system itself. Here, we propose a novel elicitation method based on iterated in-context learning (Zhu and Griffiths, 2024a) and apply it to elicit trustworthiness priors using the Trust Game from behavioral game theory. The Trust Game is particularly well suited for this purpose because it operationalizes trust as voluntary exposure to risk based on beliefs about another agent, rather than self-reported attitudes. Using our method, we elicit trustworthiness priors from several leading large language models (LLMs) and find that GPT-4.1's trustworthiness priors closely track those observed in humans. Building on this result, we further examine how GPT-4.1 responds to different player personas in the Trust Game, providing an initial characterization of how such models differentiate trust across agent characteristics. Finally, we show that variation in elicited trustworthiness can be well predicted by a stereotype-based model grounded in perceived warmth and competence."}

To address this opacity, we introduce a representational perspective to investigate the dynamics of the model's internal states. Through comprehensive experiments across models at various training stages, we discover that post-training yields only limited improvement in static initial representation quality. Furthermore, we reveal that, distinct from non-reasoning tasks, reasoning involves a significant continuous distributional shift in representations during generation. Comparative analysis indicates that post-training empowers models to drive this transition toward a better distribution for task solving. To clarify the relationship between internal states and external outputs, statistical analysis confirms a high correlation between generation correctness and the final representations; while counterfactual experiments identify the semantics of the generated tokens, rather than additional computation during inference or intrinsic parameter differences, as the dominant driver of the transition. Collectively, we offer a novel understanding of the reasoning process and the effect of training on reasoning enhancement, providing valuable insights for future model analysis and optimization."}

Unlike open-ended generation, text scoring failures are directly testable: an attack succeeds when an irrelevant or rejected text outscores a relevant or chosen one. Using this principled lens of text scoring, we demonstrate that current adversarial training formulations for language models are often short-sighted, failing to effectively generalize across attacks. To address this, we introduce multiple adversarial training methods for text scoring models and show that combining complementary training methods can yield strong robustness while also improving task effectiveness. We also highlight the practical value of our approach for RLHF, showing that our adversarially trained reward models mitigate reward hacking and support the training of better-aligned LLMs. We provide our code and models for further study."}

While a few laypeople LSI datasets exist, there has been little research to explore the differences between court and laypeople data for LSI. In this work, we create ILSIC, a corpus of laypeople queries covering 500+ statutes from Indian law. Additionally, the corpus also contains court case judgements to enable researchers to effectively compare between court and laypeople data for LSI. We conducted extensive experiments on our corpus, including benchmarking over the laypeople dataset using zero and few-shot inference, retrieval-augmented generation and supervised fine-tuning.

Neural FOXP2 proceeds in three stages: (i) Localize: We train per-layer SAEs so each activation decomposes into a small set of active feature components. For every feature, we quantify English vs. Hindi/Spanish selectivity overall logit-mass lift toward the target-language token set. Tracing the top-ranked features back to their strongest contributing units yields a compact language-neuron set. (ii) Steering directions: We localize controllable language-shift geometry via a spectral low-rank analysis. For each layer, we build English to target activation-difference matrices and perform layerwise SVD to extract the dominant singular directions governing language change. The eigengap and effective-rank spectra identify a compact steering subspace and an empirically chosen intervention window (where these directions are strongest and most stable). (iii) Steer: We apply a signed, sparse activation shift targeted to the language neurons. Concretely, within low to mid layers we add a positive steering along the target-language dominant directions and a compensating negative shift toward the null space for the English neurons, yielding controllable target-language defaultness."}

Current approaches in this domain present a clear trade-off: PPO-style methods (e.g., GRPO/DAPO) offer training stability but exhibit slow learning trajectories due to their trust-region constraints on policy updates, while REINFORCE-style approaches (e.g., CISPO) demonstrate improved learning efficiency but suffer from performance instability as they clip importance sampling weights while still permitting non-zero gradients outside the trust-region. To address these limitations, we introduce DISPO, a simple yet effective REINFORCE-style algorithm that decouples the up-clipping and down-clipping of importance sampling weights for correct and incorrect responses, yielding four controllable policy update regimes. Through targeted ablations, we uncover how each regime impacts training: for correct responses, weights >1 increase the average token entropy (i.e., exploration) while weights <1 decrease it (i.e., distillation) -- both beneficial but causing gradual performance degradation when excessive. For incorrect responses, overly restrictive clipping triggers sudden performance collapse through repetitive outputs (when weights >1) or vanishing response lengths (when weights <1). By separately tuning these four clipping parameters, DISPO maintains the exploration-distillation balance while preventing catastrophic failures, achieving 61.04% on AIME'24 (vs. 55.42% CISPO and 50.21% DAPO) with similar gains across various benchmarks and models."}

Our experiments reveal that these value neurons are robust across diverse datasets, model scales, and architectures; furthermore, they exhibit significant transferability across different datasets and models fine-tuned from the same base model. By examining cases where value predictions and actual rewards diverge, we identify dopamine neurons within the reward subsystem which encode reward prediction errors (RPE). These neurons exhibit high activation when the reward is higher than expected and low activation when the reward is lower than expected."}

Our recipe follows a two-stage curriculum: (1) Progressive Knowledge Distillation, which aligns byte-level representations with the embeddings of the token-trained teacher model; and (2) Byte-Level Supervised Fine-Tuning, which enables end-to-end generation entirely in the byte space. We validate our approach across multiple model families, including Llama, Qwen, and OLMo, and demonstrate that the distilled BLMs retain most of the teacher models' performance using only approximately 125B bytes."}

Can they faithfully model novice reasoning and metacognitive judgments? Existing evaluations emphasize problem-solving accuracy, overlooking the fragmented and imperfect reasoning that characterizes human learning. We evaluate LLMs as novices using 630 think-aloud utterances from multi-step chemistry tutoring problems with problem-solving logs of student hint use, attempts, and problem context. We compare LLM-generated reasoning to human learner utterances under minimal and extended contextual prompting, and assess the models' ability to predict step-level learner success. Although GPT-4.1 generates fluent and contextually appropriate continuations, its reasoning is systematically over-coherent, verbose, and less variable than human think-alouds. These effects intensify with a richer problem-solving context during prompting. Learner performance was consistently overestimated. These findings highlight epistemic limitations of simulating learning with LLMs. We attribute these limitations to LLM training data, including expert-like solutions devoid of expressions of affect and working memory constraints during problem solving.

This raises an important question for LLM-based dialogue agents: whether such variations reflect inconsistency or context-sensitive adaptation akin to human behavior.

To investigate the effectiveness of knowledge purification, we further propose five purification methods from various perspectives. Our experiments demonstrate that these methods not only improve the performance of the distilled model but also effectively alleviate knowledge conflicts.

In each iteration, it optionally produces a high-level plan, selects a set of reasoning tools and a compute strategy together with an exploration parameter, and then generates a candidate reasoning trajectory. A process reward model (PRM) serves as a unified control signal: within each iteration, step-level PRM scores are aggregated to guide pruning and expansion during generation, and across iterations, aggregated trajectory rewards are used to select the final response. Across datasets, our dynamic, PRM-guided approach consistently outperforms direct test-time scaling, yielding large gains on MATH-500 and several-fold improvements on harder benchmarks such as AIME24 and AMO-Bench.

While recent advances have extended TPPs to handle textual information, existing approaches are limited in their ability to generate rich, multimodal content and reason about event dynamics. A key challenge is that incorporating multimodal data dramatically increases sequence length, hindering the ability of attention-based models to generate coherent, long-form textual descriptions that require long-range understanding. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that extends LLM-based TPPs to the visual modality, positioning text generation as a core capability alongside time and type prediction. Our approach addresses the long-context problem through an adaptive sequence compression mechanism based on temporal similarity, which reduces sequence length while preserving essential patterns. We employ a two-stage paradigm of pre-training on compressed sequences followed by supervised fine-tuning for downstream tasks. Extensive experiments, including on the challenging DanmakuTPP-QA benchmark, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both predictive accuracy and the quality of its generated textual analyses."}

We adopt a dataset-centric view of cultural alignment and ask which linguistic properties of fine-tuning data are associated with cultural performance, whether these properties are predictive prior to training, and how these effects vary across models. We compute lightweight linguistic, semantic, and structural metrics for Arabic, Chinese, and Japanese datasets and apply principal component analysis separately within each language. This design ensures that the resulting components capture variation among datasets written in the same language rather than differences between languages. The resulting components correspond to broadly interpretable axes related to semantic coherence, surface-level lexical and syntactic diversity, and lexical or structural richness, though their composition varies across languages. We fine-tune three major LLM families (LLaMA, Mistral, DeepSeek) and evaluate them on benchmarks of cultural knowledge, values, and norms. While PCA components correlate with downstream performance, these associations are strongly model-dependent. Through controlled subset interventions, we show that lexical-oriented components (PC3) are the most robust, yielding more consistent performance across models and benchmarks, whereas emphasizing semantic or diversity extremes (PC1-PC2) is often neutral or harmful."}

The review looks at developments from early multimodal fusion methods to new frameworks that use contrastive models like CLIP, diffusion-based text-to-image generation, and large language model (LLM) support. Studies from 2016 to 2025 are examined to show the growth of VWSD through feature-based, graph-based, and contrastive embedding techniques.

In this work, we provide both theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrating that the sink in Vanilla Attention and Sink Attention naturally construct a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism within attention layers. This insight explains the head collapse phenomenon observed in prior work, where only a fixed subset of attention heads contributes to generation. To mitigate head collapse, we propose a sink-aware training algorithm with an auxiliary load balancing loss designed for attention layers.

We systematically study three questions: (i) how cold-start SFT induces an agentic, tool-using behavioral prior, (ii) how the interaction density of cold-start trajectories shapes exploration and downstream RL outcomes, and (iii) how the RL interaction budget affects learning dynamics and generalization under varying inference-time budgets.

However, some questions require inference, i.e., deriving answers that are not explicitly stated but can be inferred from the available information. We introduce Inferential QA -- a new task that challenges models to infer answers from answer-supporting passages which provide only clues. To study this problem, we construct QUIT (QUestions requiring Inference from Texts) dataset, comprising 7,401 questions and 2.4M passages built from high-convergence human- and machine-authored hints, labeled across three relevance levels using LLM-based answerability and human verification. Through comprehensive evaluation of retrievers, rerankers, and LLM-based readers, we show that methods effective on traditional QA tasks struggle in inferential QA: retrievers underperform, rerankers offer limited gains, and fine-tuning provides inconsistent improvements. Even reasoning-oriented LLMs fail to outperform smaller general-purpose models. These findings reveal that current QA pipelines are not yet ready for inference-based reasoning. Inferential QA thus establishes a new class of QA tasks that move towards understanding and reasoning from indirect textual evidence."}

This variation suggests that using a fixed draft length limits the potential for further improvements in decoding speed. To address this challenge, we propose Pacer, a novel approach that dynamically controls draft length using a lightweight, trainable pre-verification layer. This layer pre-verifies draft tokens blockwise before they are sent to the target model, allowing the draft model to stop token generation if the blockwise pre-verification fails. We implement Pacer on multiple SD model pairs and evaluate its performance across various benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that Pacer achieves up to 2.66x Speedup over autoregressive decoding and consistently outperforms standard speculative decoding. Furthermore, when integrated with Ouroboros, Pacer attains up to 3.09x Speedup."}

To address this, we propose DreamOn, a novel diffusion framework that enables dynamic, variable-length generation. DreamOn augments the diffusion process with two length control states, allowing the model to autonomously expand or contract the output length based solely on its own predictions.

Recent work mainly focused on improving answer accuracy via fine-tuning and structured or reinforcement-based optimization. However, reliable reasoning in response generation faces three challenges: 1) Reasoning Collapse. Reasoning in multi-hop QA is inherently complex due to multi-hop composition and is further destabilized by noisy retrieval. 2) Reasoning-answer inconsistency. Due to the intrinsic uncertainty of LLM generation and exposure to evidence--distractor mixtures, models may produce correct answers that are not faithfully supported by their intermediate reasoning or evidence. 3) Loss of format control. Traditional chain-of-thought generation often deviates from required structured output formats, leading to incomplete or malformed structured content. To address these challenges, we propose CRAFT (Calibrated Reasoning with Answer-Faithful Traces), a Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based reinforcement learning framework that trains models to perform faithful reasoning during response generation. CRAFT employs dual reward mechanisms to optimize multi-hop reasoning: deterministic rewards ensure structural correctness while judge-based rewards verify semantic faithfulness. This optimization framework supports controllable trace variants that enable systematic analysis of how structure and scale affect reasoning performance and faithfulness. Experiments on three multi-hop QA benchmarks show that CRAFT improves both answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness across model scales, with the CRAFT 7B model achieving competitive performance with closed-source LLMs across multiple reasoning trace settings."}

XDLM offers two key contributions: (1) it provides a principled theoretical unification of MDLM and UDLM, recovering each paradigm as a special case; and (2) an alleviated memory bottleneck enabled by an algebraic simplification of the posterior probabilities.

A central component in this process is the reward model, which evaluates partial solutions and guides the allocation of computation during inference.\n  However, in practice, true reward models are never available. All deployed systems rely on approximate reward models, raising a fundamental question: Why and when do approximate reward models suffice for effective inference-time scaling? In this work, we provide a theoretical answer. We identify the Bellman error of the approximate reward model as the key quantity governing the effectiveness of SMC-based inference-time scaling. For a reasoning process of length $T$, we show that if the Bellman error of the approximate reward model is bounded by $O(1/T)$, then combining this reward model with SMC reduces the computational complexity of reasoning from exponential in $T$ to polynomial in $T$. This yields an exponential improvement in inference efficiency despite using only approximate rewards."}

In this work, we revisit where and how to distill in autoregressive LLMs. We disentangle selective KD along the position, class, and sample axes and systematically compare importance signals and selection policies. Then, guided by this analysis, we identify underexplored opportunities and introduce student-entropy-guided position selection (SE-KD). Across a suite of benchmarks, SE-KD often improves accuracy, downstream task adherence, and memory efficiency over dense distillation. Extending this approach across the class and sample axes (SE-KD 3X) yields complementary efficiency gains that make offline teacher caching feasible.

HLS offers faster iteration cycles, portability, and design permutability that make it a natural layer for agentic optimization.This position paper makes three contributions.

This phenomenon arises from multi-question contextual pressure during generation and consistently manifests across models and benchmarks. Building on this observation, we propose ConPress (Learning from Contextual Pressure), a lightweight self-supervised fine-tuning approach. ConPress constructs multi-question prompts to induce self-compression, samples the resulting model outputs, and parses and filters per-question traces to obtain concise yet correct reasoning trajectories.

AROA defines originality as rarity within a reference corpus and evaluates it through four complementary components: structural rarity, claim rarity, evidence rarity, and cognitive depth. The framework quantifies the rarity of each component using density estimation and integrates them with a quality adjustment mechanism, thereby treating quality and originality as independent evaluation axes. Experiments using human essays and AI-generated essays revealed a strong negative correlation between quality and claim rarity, demonstrating a quality-originality trade-off where higher-quality texts tend to rely on typical claim patterns.

Specifically, the attention scores of the last token function as the weights, while the output projection matrix ($W_O$) aligns these weighted value vectors with the common space of the LLM residual stream. This refined method, termed Aligned Weighted VA (AlignedWVA), achieves state-of-the-art performance among training-free LLM-based embeddings, outperforming the high-cost MetaEOL by a substantial margin. Finally, we highlight the potential of obtaining strong LLM embedding models through fine-tuning Value Aggregation."}

Yet SVs can be unreliable in practice. Some concepts are unsteerable, and even when steering helps on average it can backfire for a non-trivial fraction of inputs. Reliability also degrades in long-form generation and multi-attribute steering. We take a geometric view of these failures. A static SV applies the same update vector everywhere in representation space, implicitly assuming that the concept-improving direction is constant across contexts. When the locally effective direction varies with the current activation, a single global vector can become misaligned, which yields weak or reversed effects. Guided by this perspective, we propose Steering Vector Fields (SVF), which learns a differentiable concept scoring function whose local gradient defines the steering direction at each activation, making interventions explicitly context-dependent. This formulation supports coordinated multi-layer interventions in a shared, aligned concept space, and enables efficient long-form and multi-attribute control within a unified framework. Across multiple LLMs and steering tasks, SVF delivers stronger and more reliable control, improving the practicality of inference-time steering."}

Specifically, first, we identify a test-time scaling tendency (extended reasoning token budget boosts difficulty but reduces solvability) and the intrinsic properties defining the upper bound of a model's ability to generate valid, high-difficulty questions. Then, we develop CoDiQ-Generator from Qwen3-8B, which improves the upper bound of difficult question generation, making it particularly well-suited for challenging question construction.

We hypothesize that effective steering corresponds to structured entropy preservation and coherent KL alignment across decoding steps. Building on a reliability study demonstrating high inter-judge agreement between two architecturally distinct LLMs, we use LLM-generated annotations as ground truth and show that these mechanistic signals provide meaningful predictive power for identifying successful steering and estimating failure probability.

Most existing guardrails for CUAs adopt a reactive approach, constraining agent behavior only within the current observation space. While these guardrails can prevent immediate short-term risks (e.g., clicking on a phishing link), they cannot proactively avoid long-term risks: seemingly reasonable actions can lead to high-risk consequences that emerge with a delay (e.g., cleaning logs leads to future audits being untraceable), which reactive guardrails cannot identify within the current observation space. To address these limitations, we propose a predictive guardrail approach, with the core idea of aligning predicted future risks with current decisions. Based on this approach, we present SafePred, a predictive guardrail framework for CUAs that establishes a risk-to-decision loop to ensure safe agent behavior. SafePred supports two key abilities: (1) Short- and long-term risk prediction: by using safety policies as the basis for risk prediction, SafePred leverages the prediction capability of the world model to generate semantic representations of both short-term and long-term risks, thereby identifying and pruning actions that lead to high-risk states; (2) Decision optimization: translating predicted risks into actionable safe decision guidances through step-level interventions and task-level re-planning. Extensive experiments show that SafePred significantly reduces high-risk behaviors, achieving over 97.6% safety performance and improving task utility by up to 21.4% compared with reactive baselines."}

In this paper, we propose WorldCup, a multi-bit watermarking framework for LLMs that treats sampling as a natural communication channel and embeds message bits directly into token selection via a hierarchical competition mechanism guided by complementary signals. Moreover, WorldCup further adopts entropy-aware modulation to preserve generation quality and supports robust message recovery through confidence-aware decoding. Comprehensive experiments show that WorldCup achieves a strong balance across capacity, detectability, robustness, text quality, and decoding efficiency, consistently outperforming prior baselines and laying a solid foundation for future LLM watermarking studies."}

Existing approaches mainly either verbalize graphs into natural language, which leads to excessive token consumption and scattered attention, or transform graphs into trainable continuous embeddings (i.e., soft prompt), but exhibit severe misalignment with original text tokens. To solve this problem, we propose to incorporate one special token <SOG_k> to fully represent the Structure Of Graph within a unified token space, facilitating explicit topology input and structural information sharing. Specifically, we propose a topology-aware structural tokenizer that maps each graph topology into a highly selective single token. Afterwards, we construct a set of hybrid structure Question-Answering corpora to align new structural tokens with existing text tokens. With this approach, <SOG_k> empowers LLMs to understand, generate, and reason in a concise and accurate manner. Extensive experiments on five graph-level benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving a performance improvement of 9.9% to 41.4% compared to the baselines while exhibiting interpretability and consistency. Furthermore, our method provides a flexible extension to node-level tasks, enabling both global and local structural understanding.

Although recent advancements have widely adopted context compression to address these challenges, existing research only focus on model-side improvements, the impact of the data distribution itself on context compression remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we are the first to adopt a data-centric perspective to systematically investigate how data distribution impacts compression quality, including two dimensions: input data and intrinsic data (i.e., the model's internal pretrained knowledge). We evaluate the semantic integrity of compressed representations using an autoencoder-based framework to systematically investigate it. Our experimental results reveal that: (1) encoder-measured input entropy negatively correlates with compression quality, while decoder-measured entropy shows no significant relationship under a frozen-decoder setting; and (2) the gap between intrinsic data of the encoder and decoder significantly diminishes compression gains, which is hard to mitigate. Based on these findings, we further present practical guidelines to optimize compression gains."}

Currently, these models rely on a text-based paradigm that treats source code as a linear sequence of tokens, which leads to a linear increase in context length and associated computational costs. The rapid advancement of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) introduces an opportunity to optimize efficiency by representing source code as rendered images. Unlike text, which is difficult to compress without losing semantic meaning, the image modality is inherently suitable for compression. By adjusting resolution, images can be scaled to a fraction of their original token cost while remaining recognizable to vision-capable models. To explore the feasibility of this approach, we conduct the first systematic study on the effectiveness of MLLMs for code understanding. Our experiments reveal that: (1) MLLMs can effectively understand code with substantial token reduction, achieving up to 8x compression; (2) MLLMs can effectively leverage visual cues such as syntax highlighting, improving code completion performance under 4x compression; and (3) Code-understanding tasks like clone detection exhibit exceptional resilience to visual compression, with some compression ratios even slightly outperforming raw text inputs. Our findings highlight both the potential and current limitations of MLLMs in code understanding, which points out a shift toward image-modality code representation as a pathway to more efficient inference."}

We argue that such static embedding of the target word is insensitive to neighboring words, encouraging locally accurate word prediction while neglecting global structure across the target sentence. To address this limitation, we propose a continuous sentence representation, termed sentence curve, defined as a spline curve whose control points affect multiple words in the sentence. Based on this representation, we introduce sentence curve language model (SCLM), which extends DLMs to predict sentence curves instead of the static word embeddings. We theoretically show that sentence curve prediction induces a regularization effect that promotes global structure modeling, and characterize how different sentence curve types affect this behavior. Empirically, SCLM achieves SOTA performance among DLMs on IWSLT14 and WMT14, shows stable training without burdensome knowledge distillation, and demonstrates promising potential compared to discrete DLMs on LM1B."}

Inspired by human reading behavior (i.e., close reading important content while skimming less relevant content), RAM partitions the context into segments and encodes them with the input query in parallel. High-relevance segments are fully retained (close reading), while low-relevance ones are query-guided compressed into compact summary vectors (skimming). Both explicit textual segments and implicit summary vectors are concatenated and fed into decoder to achieve both superior performance and natural language format interpretability. To refine the decision boundary between close reading and skimming, we further introduce a contrastive learning objective based on positive and negative query-segment pairs. Experiments demonstrate that RAM outperforms existing baselines on multiple question answering and summarization benchmarks across two backbones, while delivering up to a 12x end-to-end speedup on long inputs (average length 16K; maximum length 32K)."}

Recent approaches, such as teaching models to say \"I don't know\" or post-hoc knowledge editing, either evade the problem or face catastrophic forgetting. To address this issue from its root, we propose \\textbf{PretrainRL}, a novel framework that integrates reinforcement learning into the pretraining phase to consolidate factual knowledge. The core principle of PretrainRL is \"\\textbf{debiasing then learning}.\" It actively reshapes the model's probability distribution by down-weighting high-probability falsehoods, thereby making \"room\" for low-probability truths to be learned effectively. To enable this, we design an efficient negative sampling strategy to discover these high-probability falsehoods and introduce novel metrics to evaluate the model's probabilistic state concerning factual knowledge. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks demonstrate that PretrainRL significantly alleviates factual hallucinations and outperforms state-of-the-art methods."}

To address this gap, we introduce ES-MemEval, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically evaluates five core memory capabilities: information extraction, temporal reasoning, conflict detection, abstention, and user modeling, in long-term emotional support settings, covering question answering, summarization, and dialogue generation tasks. To support the benchmark, we also propose EvoEmo, a multi-session dataset for personalized long-term emotional support that captures fragmented, implicit user disclosures and evolving user states. Extensive experiments on open-source long-context, commercial, and retrieval-augmented (RAG) LLMs show that explicit long-term memory is essential for reducing hallucinations and enabling effective personalization. At the same time, RAG improves factual consistency but struggles with temporal dynamics and evolving user states. These findings highlight both the potential and limitations of current paradigms and motivate more robust integration of memory and retrieval for long-term personalized dialogue systems."}

Analysis of end-of-course feedback from 19 students reveals high satisfaction (mean scores 4.4-4.6/5.0) across engagement, conceptual learning, and assessment fairness.

However, these methods suffer from a \"Static Graph Fallacy\": they rely on fixed transition probabilities determined during indexing. This rigidity ignores the query-dependent nature of edge relevance, causing semantic drift where random walks are diverted into high-degree \"hub\" nodes before reaching critical downstream evidence. Consequently, models often achieve high partial recall but fail to retrieve the complete evidence chain required for multi-hop queries. To address this, we propose CatRAG, Context-Aware Traversal for robust RAG, a framework that builds on the HippoRAG 2 architecture and transforms the static KG into a query-adaptive navigation structure. We introduce a multi-faceted framework to steer the random walk: (1) Symbolic Anchoring, which injects weak entity constraints to regularize the random walk; (2) Query-Aware Dynamic Edge Weighting, which dynamically modulates graph structure, to prune irrelevant paths while amplifying those aligned with the query's intent; and (3) Key-Fact Passage Weight Enhancement, a cost-efficient bias that structurally anchors the random walk to likely evidence. Experiments across four multi-hop benchmarks demonstrate that CatRAG consistently outperforms state of the art baselines. Our analysis reveals that while standard Recall metrics show modest gains, CatRAG achieves substantial improvements in reasoning completeness, the capacity to recover the entire evidence path without gaps. These results reveal that our approach effectively bridges the gap between retrieving partial context and enabling fully grounded reasoning.

We introduce Moe-Ctc, a Mixture-of-Experts architecture with intermediate CTC supervision that jointly promotes expert specialization and generalization. During training, accent-aware routing encourages experts to capture accent-specific patterns, which gradually transitions to label-free routing for inference. Each expert is equipped with its own CTC head to align routing with transcription quality, and a routing-augmented loss further stabilizes optimization.

To address this issue, we propose an Orthogonal Hierarchical Decomposition (OHD) framework that constructs structure-preserving input representations of complex tables for LLMs. OHD introduces an Orthogonal Tree Induction (OTI) method based on spatial--semantic co-constraints, which decomposes irregular tables into a column tree and a row tree to capture vertical and horizontal hierarchical dependencies, respectively. Building on this representation, we design a dual-pathway association protocol to symmetrically reconstruct semantic lineage of each cell, and incorporate an LLM as a semantic arbitrator to align multi-level semantic information. We evaluate OHD framework on two complex table question answering benchmarks, AITQA and HiTab.

To explore this, our study presents a self-sampling framework based on activation steering for efficient CoT learning.

We argue retrieval should move beyond similarity matching and instead operate over latent components, following decoupling to aggregation: disentangle memories into semantic components, organise them into a hierarchy, and use this structure to drive retrieval. We propose xMemory, which builds a hierarchy of intact units and maintains a searchable yet faithful high-level node organisation via a sparsity--semantics objective that guides memory split and merge. At inference, xMemory retrieves top-down, selecting a compact, diverse set of themes and semantics for multi-fact queries, and expanding to episodes and raw messages only when it reduces the reader's uncertainty.

We present LEC-KG, a bidirectional collaborative framework that integrates the semantic understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the structural reasoning of Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE). Our approach features three key components: (1) hierarchical coarse-to-fine relation extraction that mitigates long-tail bias, (2) evidence-guided Chain-of-Thought feedback that grounds structural suggestions in source text, and (3) semantic initialization that enables structural validation for unseen entities. The two modules enhance each other iteratively-KGE provides structure-aware feedback to refine LLM extractions, while validated triples progressively improve KGE representations. We evaluate LEC-KG on Chinese Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) reports, demonstrating substantial improvements over LLM baselines, particularly on low-frequency relations. Through iterative refinement, our framework reliably transforms unstructured policy text into validated knowledge graph triples."}

Moreover, naive length penalties in group-relative optimization can severely hurt accuracy. We attribute this failure to two structural issues: (i) Dilution of Length Baseline, where incorrect responses (with zero length reward) depress the group baseline and over-penalize correct solutions; and (ii) Difficulty-Penalty Mismatch, where a static penalty cannot adapt to problem difficulty, suppressing necessary reasoning on hard instances while leaving redundancy on easy ones. We propose Dynamic Decoupled Conditional Advantage (DDCA) to decouple efficiency optimization from correctness. DDCA computes length advantages conditionally within the correct-response cluster to eliminate baseline dilution, and dynamically scales the penalty strength using the group pass rate as a proxy for difficulty. Experiments on GSM8K, MATH500, AMC23, and AIME25 show that DDCA consistently improves the efficiency--accuracy trade-off relative to adaptive baselines, reducing generated tokens by approximately 60% on simpler tasks (e.g., GSM8K) versus over 20% on harder benchmarks (e.g., AIME25), thereby maintaining or improving accuracy.

The model is released in three sizes: 24B - adapted from the Mistral-Small-3.1 base model, 12B - adapted from the NVIDIA Nemotron Nano V2 model, and 1.7B - adapted from the Qwen3-1.7B base model. We are releasing multiple variants of each model, each with a native context length of 65k tokens; base model and chat model with tool-calling support.

The primary culprits are the activations, whose memory footprints scale linearly with sequence length. We introduce OOMB, a highly memory-efficient training system that directly confronts this barrier. Our approach employs a chunk-recurrent training framework with on-the-fly activation recomputation, which maintains a constant activation memory footprint (O(1)) and shifts the primary bottleneck to the growing KV cache. To manage the KV cache, OOMB integrates a suite of synergistic optimizations: a paged memory manager for both the KV cache and its gradients to eliminate fragmentation, asynchronous CPU offloading to hide data transfer latency, and page-level sparse attention to reduce both computational complexity and communication overhead. The synergy of these techniques yields exceptional efficiency. Our empirical results show that for every additional 10K tokens of context, the end-to-end training memory overhead increases by a mere 10MB for Qwen2.5-7B. This allows training Qwen2.5-7B with a 4M-token context on a single H200 GPU, a feat that would otherwise require a large cluster using context parallelism. This work represents a substantial advance in resource efficiency for long-context LLM training. The source code is available at https://github.com/wenhaoli-xmu/OOMB."}

Across eleven categories of refusal and non-compliance, including safety, incomplete or unsupported requests, anthropomorphization, and over-refusal, we find that these refusal behaviors correspond to geometrically distinct directions in activation space. Yet despite this diversity, linear steering along any refusal-related direction produces nearly identical refusal to over-refusal trade-offs, acting as a shared one-dimensional control knob. The primary effect of different directions is not whether the model refuses, but how it refuses."}

To investigate this question, we introduce GapEval, a bidirectional benchmark designed to quantify the gap between understanding and generation capabilities, and quantitatively measure the cognitive coherence of the two \"unified\" directions. Each question can be answered in both modalities (image and text), enabling a symmetric evaluation of a model's bidirectional inference capability and cross-modal consistency. Experiments reveal a persistent gap between the two directions across a wide range of UMMs with different architectures, suggesting that current models achieve only surface-level unification rather than deep cognitive convergence of the two. To further explore the underlying mechanism, we conduct an empirical study from the perspective of knowledge manipulation to illustrate the underlying limitations. Our findings indicate that knowledge within UMMs often remains disjoint. The capability emergence and knowledge across modalities are unsynchronized, paving the way for further exploration."}

In this paper, we present Focus-dLLM, a novel training-free attention sparsification framework tailored for accurate and efficient long-context dLLM inference. Based on the finding that token confidence strongly correlates across adjacent steps, we first design a past confidence-guided indicator to predict unmasked regions.

Existing linguistic benchmarks typically focus on narrow phenomena, emphasize high-resource languages, and rarely evaluate metalinguistic knowledge-explicit reasoning about language structure rather than language use. Using accuracy and macro F1, together with majority-class and chance baselines, we analyse overall performance and examine variation by linguistic domains and language-related factors. Our results show that metalinguistic knowledge in current LLMs is limited: GPT-4o performs best but achieves only moderate accuracy (0.367), while open-source models lag behind. All models perform above chance but fail to outperform the majority-class baseline, suggesting they capture cross-linguistic patterns but lack fine-grained grammatical distinctions. Performance varies across linguistic domains, with lexical features showing the highest accuracy and phonological features among the lowest, partially reflecting differences in online visibility. At the language level, accuracy shows a strong association with digital language status: languages with higher digital presence and resource availability are evaluated more accurately, while low-resource languages show substantially lower performance. Analyses of predictive factors confirm that resource-related indicators (Wikipedia size, corpus availability) are more informative predictors of accuracy than geographical, genealogical, or sociolinguistic factors. Together, these results suggest that LLMs' metalinguistic knowledge is fragmented and shaped by data availability rather than generalizable grammatical competence across the world's languages. We release our benchmark as an open-source dataset to support systematic evaluation and encourage greater global linguistic diversity in future LLMs."}

While prior works mainly focus on point-wise and pair-wise evaluation paradigms. Rubric-based evaluation, where LLMs select a score from multiple rubrics, has received less analysis. In this work, we show that rubric-based evaluation implicitly resembles a multi-choice setting and therefore has position bias: LLMs prefer score options appearing at specific positions in the rubric list. Through controlled experiments across multiple models and datasets, we demonstrate consistent position bias. To mitigate this bias, we propose a balanced permutation strategy that evenly distributes each score option across positions. We show that aggregating scores across balanced permutations not only reveals latent position bias, but also improves correlation between the LLM-as-a-Judge and human. Our results suggest that rubric-based LLM-as-a-Judge is not inherently point-wise and that simple permutation-based calibration can substantially improve its reliability."}

Despite the heuristic focus on regularity, it is often more an intuitive judgement than a quantified evaluation, and irregularity is more common than expected from the Neogrammarian model. Given the recent progress of computational methods in historical linguistics and the increased availability of standardized lexical data, we are now able to improve our workflows and provide such a quantitative evaluation. Here, we present the balanced average recurrence of correspondence patterns as a new measure of regularity. We also present a new computational method that uses this measure to identify cognate sets that lack regularity with respect to their correspondence patterns. We validate the method through two experiments, using simulated and real data. In the experiments, we employ leave-one-out validation to measure the regularity of cognate sets in which one word form has been replaced by an irregular one, checking how well our method identifies the forms causing the irregularity. Our method achieves an overall accuracy of 85\\% with the datasets based on real data. We also show the benefits of working with subsamples of large datasets and how increasing irregularity in the data influences our results.

We propose a multi-layered architecture that integrates specialized Natural Language Understanding (NLU) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), allowing for both structured service flows and dynamic, knowledge-intensive responses grounded in curated enterprise documentation.

With a small set of Estonian native speaker annotations as a reference point, we find systematic ranking instabilities: surface-level metrics (lexical diversity, surface and semantic similarity) maintain cross-language stability, but pragmatic judgments (coherence, instruction-following) exhibit rank inversions and near-zero correlations. Because generation is controlled, these inconsistencies reflect how judge scoring behaves differently across languages rather than true model differences.\n  This controlled design provides a diagnostic probe: evaluation methods that fail to maintain stability under identical generation conditions signal transfer failure before deployment. Our findings suggest that zero-shot judge transfer is unreliable for discourse-level assessment in morphologically rich languages, motivating language-specific calibration against targeted human baselines.

In this work, we propose a fully automated annotation framework for generating precise molecular structure descriptions at scale. Our approach builds upon and extends a rule-based chemical nomenclature parser to interpret IUPAC names and construct enriched, structured XML metadata that explicitly encodes molecular structure. This metadata is then used to guide LLMs in producing accurate natural-language descriptions. Using this framework, we curate a large-scale dataset of approximately $163$k molecule-description pairs. A rigorous validation protocol combining LLM-based and expert human evaluation on a subset of $2,000$ molecules demonstrates a high description precision of $98.6\\%$.

This disparity is particularly evident in in-context learning scenarios, where providing demonstrations in English but testing on non-English inputs leads to significant performance degradation. In this paper, we hypothesize that LLMs develop a universal semantic space for understanding languages, where different languages are encoded as distinct directions within this space. Based on this hypothesis, we propose language vectors -- a training-free language steering approach that leverages activation differences between source and target languages to guide model behavior. We steer the model generations by adding the vector to the intermediate model activations during inference. This is done to make the model's internal representations shift towards the target language space without any parameter updates. We evaluate our method across three datasets and test on a total of 19 languages on three different models. Our results show consistent improvements on multilingual in-context learning over baselines across all tasks and languages tested. Beyond performance gains, hierarchical clustering of steering vectors reveals meaningful linguistic structure aligned with language families. These vectors also successfully transfer across tasks, demonstrating that these representations are task-agnostic."}

Building on this view, we propose a unified preference-utility analysis that separates control effects into preference, defined as the tendency toward a target concept, and utility, defined as coherent and task-valid generation, and measures both on a shared log-odds scale using polarity-paired contrastive examples. Across methods, we observe a consistent trade-off between preference and utility: stronger control increases preference while predictably reducing utility. We further explain this behavior through an activation manifold perspective, in which control shifts representations along target-concept directions to enhance preference, while utility declines primarily when interventions push representations off the model's valid-generation manifold. Finally, we introduce a new steering approach SPLIT guided by this analysis that improves preference while better preserving utility.

Low-friction assistants can become sycophantic, baking in implicit assumptions and pushing verification costs onto experts, while outcomes arrive too late to serve as reward signals. In deep-uncertainty decisions (where objectives are contested and reversals are costly), scaling fluent agreement amplifies poor commitments faster than it builds expertise. We argue reliable human-AI partnership requires a shift from answer generation to collaborative premise governance over a knowledge substrate, negotiating only what is decision-critical. A discrepancy-driven control loop operates over this substrate: detecting conflicts, localizing misalignment via typed discrepancies (teleological, epistemic, procedural), and triggering bounded negotiation through decision slices. Commitment gating blocks action on uncommitted load-bearing premises unless overridden under logged risk; value-gated challenge allocates probing under interaction cost. Trust then attaches to auditable premises and evidence standards, not conversational fluency. We illustrate with tutoring and propose falsifiable evaluation criteria."}

Recent approaches propose mitigating this issue by increasing inference-time structural constraints, either by encouraging abstract intermediate representations or by intervening directly in the model's internal computations; however, reliably suppressing semantic interference remains an open challenge. To make formal deduction less sensitive to semantic content, we introduce a framework for abstraction-guided reasoning that explicitly separates structural inference from lexical semantics. We construct paired content-laden and abstract syllogisms and use the model's activations on abstract inputs to define an abstract reasoning space. We then learn lightweight Abstractors that, from content-conditioned residual-stream states, predict representations aligned with this space and integrate these predictions via multi-layer interventions during the forward pass. Using cross-lingual transfer as a test bed, we show that abstraction-aligned steering reduces content-driven errors and improves validity-sensitive performance.

We view beliefs as representations in the model's latent space that emerge in response to a given input, and introduce a metric to quantify their dominance during generation.

Although promising, our analysis reveals a fundamental misalignment between general-purpose post-training and DAC-style inference, which limits the model's capacity to fully leverage this potential. To bridge this gap and fully unlock LLMs' reasoning capabilities on the most challenging tasks, we propose an end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) framework to enhance their DAC-style reasoning capacity. At each step, the policy decomposes a problem into a group of subproblems, solves them sequentially, and addresses the original one conditioned on the subproblem solutions, with both decomposition and solution integrated into RL training.

The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we propose a Reward-free Alignment framework for Conflicted Objectives (RACO) that directly leverages pairwise preference data and resolves gradient conflicts via a novel clipped variant of conflict-averse gradient descent. We provide convergence guarantees to Pareto-critical points that respect user-specified objective weights, and further show that clipping can strictly improve convergence rate in the two-objective setting. Second, we improve our method using some heuristics and conduct experiments to demonstrate the compatibility of the proposed framework for LLM alignment. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on multi-objective summarization and safety alignment tasks across multiple LLM families (Qwen 3, Llama 3, Gemma 3) show that our method consistently achieves better Pareto trade-offs compared to existing multi-objective alignment baselines."}

To address this issue, we propose a novel \\textbf{C}ontextual-aware \\textbf{C}itation generation framework (\\textbf{C$^2$}-\\textbf{Cite}) that explicitly integrates the semantic relationships between citation markers and their referenced content. Specifically, a contextual citation alignment mechanism is adopted: it first encodes the retrieved document contexts into the symbol representation of citations, then aligns the marker numbers by decoding information from a citation router function. This mechanism enables the transformation of citation markers from generic placeholders into active knowledge pointers that link to the referenced source information. Experimental results on the ALCE benchmark across three datasets validate our framework C$^2$-Cite++: it outperforms the SOTA baseline by an average of 5.8\\% in citation quality and 17.4\\% in response correctness. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/BAI-LAB/c2cite"}

High quality parsing and chunking are critical as efficient data segmentation directly impacts downstream tasks, i.e. Information Retrieval and answer generation. In this paper, we introduce ChunkNorris, a novel heuristic-based technique designed to optimise the parsing and chunking of PDF documents. Our approach does not rely on machine learning and employs a suite of simple yet effective heuristics to achieve high performance with minimal computational overhead. We demonstrate the efficiency of ChunkNorris through a comprehensive benchmark against existing parsing and chunking methods, evaluating criteria such as execution time, energy consumption, and retrieval accuracy. We propose an open-access dataset to produce our results. ChunkNorris outperforms baseline and more advanced techniques, offering a practical and efficient alternative for Information Retrieval tasks.

Conventional manual approaches, although methodologically systematic, are resource-intensive and susceptible to subjectivity, whereas heuristic and automated techniques frequently under-perform in recall unless supplemented by extensive expert input. We introduce a Large Language Model (LLM)-based chained prompt engineering framework for the automated development of search strategies in systematic reviews. The framework replicates the procedural structure of manual search design while leveraging LLMs to decompose review objectives, extract and formalize PICO elements, generate conceptual representations, expand terminologies, and synthesize Boolean queries. In addition to query construction, the framework exhibits superior performance in generating well-structured PICO elements relative to existing methods, thereby strengthening the foundation for high-recall search strategies. Evaluation on a subset of the LEADSInstruct dataset demonstrates that the framework attains a 0.9 average recall. These results significantly exceed the performance of existing approaches. Error analysis further highlights the critical role of precise objective specification and terminological alignment in optimizing retrieval effectiveness. These findings confirm the capacity of LLM-based pipelines to yield transparent, reproducible, and high-performing search strategies, and highlight their potential as scalable instruments for supporting evidence synthesis and evidence-based practice."}

However, it remains unclear whether such diagnostics generalize across languages and cultural contexts. We extend the Beacon single-turn forced-choice sycophancy diagnostic to Hindi through a controlled three-condition design: English original, Hindi literal translation, and Hindi culturally adapted prompts. We evaluate four open-weight instruction-tuned models on 50 prompts per condition, enabling separation of language encoding effects from cultural adaptation effects. Across all models, sycophancy rates are consistently higher for culturally adapted Hindi prompts than for English, with absolute differences ranging from 12.0 to 16.0 percentage points. A decomposition on Qwen 2.5-Coder-7B shows that cultural adaptation (delta = 14.0%, 95% CI: [4.0%, 26.0%]) accounts for the majority of this gap, while language encoding contributes minimally (delta = 2.0%, 95% CI: [0.0%, 6.0%]). Category-level analysis reveals that advice prompts exhibit the largest cross-lingual differences (20-25 percentage points), achieving statistical significance in two of four models.

We compare the extraction accuracy of our clinical-trial-specific RAG process against that of publicly available (standalone) LLMs. We also assess the operational impact of AI-assistance on simulated extraction CRC workflows. Our RAG process was measured as more accurate (87.8%) than standalone LLMs with fine-tuned prompts (62.6%) against expert-supported reference annotations.

To this end, we propose Intent-Amplified Code Generation (IntentCoding), a novel decoding strategy that enhances an LLM's ability to follow user intent. IntentCoding captures the influence of user intent by masking out the intent, and applies a multi-strength ensemble mechanism to amplify the effect of user intent during generation. IntentCoding is model-agnostic, requires no additional training, and integrates seamlessly with existing decoding procedures. To enable systematic evaluation, we also construct CodeConstraints, a benchmark dataset specifically designed to test user intent compliance under varying numbers of constraints. Experiments on our constructed Constraints, as well as popular IFEvalCode, HumanEval and LiveCodeBench datasets, show that our IntentCoding model significantly improves both constraint satisfaction and functional correctness compared to standard decoding approaches. IntentCoding achieves up to 71.0% relative improvement on CodeConstraints, achieves up to 67.3% relative improvement on IFEvalCode and achieves up to 29.3% relative improvement in pass@1 on HumanEval and LiveCodeBench compared with greedy decoding."}

We address this gap with FoundationalASSIST, the first English educational dataset providing the complete information needed for research on LLMs in education: full question text, actual student responses (not just right/wrong), records of which wrong answers students chose, and alignment to Common Core K-12 standards. These 1.7 million interactions from 5,000 students enable research directions that were previously impossible to pursue, from fine-tuning student models to analyzing misconception patterns. To demonstrate the dataset's utility, we evaluate four frontier models (GPT-OSS-120B, Llama-3.3-70B, Qwen3-Next-80B variants) on two complementary task families: Knowledge Tracing, testing whether LLMs can predict student performance on questions, and the exact answer a student will give; and \\textbf{Pedagogical Grounding}, testing whether LLMs understand the properties that make assessment items effective. Our evaluation reveals significant gaps in current LLM capabilities. Every model barely achieves a trivial baseline on knowledge tracing. All models fall below random chance on item discrimination, indicating that LLMs do not understand what makes one problem more diagnostic than another. Models do show competence at judging relative difficulty (up to 68.6%), but this partial success only highlights the gaps elsewhere.

To address these limitations, we propose SPARC-RAG, a multi-agent framework that coordinates sequential and parallel inference-time scaling under a unified context management mechanism. SPARC-RAG employs specialized agents that maintain a shared global context and provide explicit control over the scaling process. It generates targeted, complementary sub-queries for each branch to enable diverse parallel exploration, and explicitly regulates exiting decisions based on answer correctness and evidence grounding. To optimize scaling behavior, we further introduce a lightweight fine-tuning method with process-level verifiable preferences, which improves the efficiency of sequential scaling and effectiveness of parallel scaling.

To resolve this tension, we introduce CARE-RFT (Confidence-Anchored Regularized Reinforcement Finetuning), a novel method that replaces standard reverse KL regularization with a skew reverse KL divergence. CARE-RFT provides a confidence-sensitive penalty: it is bounded for confident, consistently rewarded explorations to enable reasoning, while unbounded elsewhere to preserve calibration. Extensive experiments across multiple model scales and RFT algorithms show that CARE-RFT achieves a superior balance, matching the reasoning performance of unconstrained RFT while recovering the trustworthiness and calibration of the base model.

By systematically applying ACEs and observing the resulting effects on model behavior across various tasks, our framework learns a causal mapping from edits to predictable outcomes. This learned constitution provides deep, generalizable insights into the model. Empirically, we validate our approach across diverse tasks, including mathematical reasoning and text-to-image alignment, for controlling and understanding model behavior. We found that for text-to-image generation, GPT-Image tends to focus on grammatical adherence, while Imagen 4 prioritizes atmospheric coherence. In mathematical reasoning, distractor variables confuse GPT-5 but leave Gemini 2.5 models and o4-mini largely unaffected.

This formulation enables an efficient ranking of a large number of candidate block-removal configurations and yields many high-quality, non-trivial solutions beyond consecutive regions. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art block-removal methods across several benchmarks, with performance gains persisting after short retraining, and reaching improvements of up to 6 points on the MMLU benchmark. Our method requires only forward and backward passes for a few active parameters, together with an (at least approximate) Ising solver, and can be readily applied to any architecture.

While search-based methods mitigate this, they incur prohibitive computational costs ($O(K)$ forward passes per step). In this work, we propose Backward-on-Entropy (BoE) Steering, a gradient-guided inference framework that approximates infinite-horizon lookahead via a single backward pass. We formally derive the Token Influence Score (TIS) from a first-order expansion of the trajectory cost functional, proving that the gradient of future entropy with respect to input embeddings serves as an optimal control signal for minimizing uncertainty. To ensure scalability, we introduce \\texttt{ActiveQueryAttention}, a sparse adjoint primitive that exploits the structure of the masking objective to reduce backward pass complexity. BoE achieves a superior Pareto frontier for inference-time scaling compared to existing unmasking methods, demonstrating that gradient-guided steering offers a mathematically principled and efficient path to robust non-autoregressive generation.

When the retrieved context is sufficient (highly relevant or including the correct answer), the retrieved text suppresses the visual attention globally, and the attention on image tokens shifts away from question-relevant regions. This leads to failures on questions the model could originally answer correctly without the retrieved text. To mitigate this issue, we propose MAD-RAG, a training-free intervention that decouples visual grounding from context integration through a dual-question formulation, combined with attention mixing to preserve image-conditioned evidence.

Across eight instruction-tuned transformer models, we run two experimental paradigms -- similarity-based forced choice and free association -- over a shared 5,000-word vocabulary, collecting 17.5M+ trials to build behavior-based similarity matrices. Using representational similarity analysis, we compare behavioral geometries to layerwise hidden-state similarity and benchmark against FastText, BERT, and cross-model consensus. We find that forced-choice behavior aligns substantially more with hidden-state geometry than free association. In a held-out-words regression, behavioral similarity (especially forced choice) predicts unseen hidden-state similarities beyond lexical baselines and cross-model consensus, indicating that behavior-only measurements retain recoverable information about internal semantic geometry.

We present SpeechLess, a wearable AR assistant that introduces a speech-based intent granularity control paradigm grounded in personalized spatial memory. SpeechLess helps users \"speak less,\" while still obtaining the information they need, and supports gradual explicitation of intent when more complex expression is required. SpeechLess binds prior interactions to multimodal personal context-space, time, activity, and referents-to form spatial memories, and leverages them to extrapolate missing intent dimensions from under-specified user queries. This enables users to dynamically adjust how explicitly they express their informational needs, from full-utterance to micro/zero-utterance interaction. We motivate our design through a week-long formative study using a commercial smart glasses platform, revealing discomfort with public voice use, frustration with repetitive speech, and hardware constraints. Building on these insights, we design SpeechLess, and evaluate it through controlled lab and in-the-wild studies. Our results indicate that regulated speech-based interaction, can improve everyday information access, reduce articulation effort, and support socially acceptable use without substantially degrading perceived usability or intent resolution accuracy across diverse everyday environments."}

Our main result bounds the Price of Anarchy by $Γ(G)$, the off-diagonal mass of a head interaction matrix capturing weight and gradient coupling.

Despite this potential, existing pipelines largely train isolated task-specific models on raw CAN data, with only limited efforts exploring decoded signals. Such fragmentation prevents shared representation learning and limits cross-task generalization. By contrast, natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) have been transformed by the foundation model paradigm: large-scale pretraining followed by task-specific adaptation. In this work, we introduce the foundation CAN model that demonstrates multi-objective downstream generalization using a single pretrained backbone. Our approach treats CAN data as a language: we pretrain on large-scale, unlabeled decoded CAN signals and fine-tune across heterogeneous auto insurance tasks. To enable this, we propose a unified tokenization scheme for mixed discrete-continuous signals and address challenges of temporal complexity and trip-specific variability. Our results show that one pretrained CAN model can adapt effectively to diverse predictive tasks, validating that the foundation modeling paradigm, proven in NLP and CV, also holds for CAN data. This establishes a new direction for generalizable representation learning in automotive AI."}

However, most existing approaches operate at the level of output critique, patching surface errors while often failing to correct deeper reasoning flaws. We propose SELF-THOUGHT, a framework that introduces an intermediate step of task abstraction before solution refinement. Given an input and an initial response, the model first distills the task into a structured template that captures key variables, constraints, and problem structure. This abstraction then guides solution instantiation, grounding subsequent responses in a clearer understanding of the task and reducing error propagation. Crucially, we show that these abstractions can be transferred across models: templates generated by larger models can serve as structured guides for smaller LLMs, which typically struggle with intrinsic self-correction. By reusing distilled task structures, smaller models achieve more reliable refinements without heavy fine-tuning or reliance on external verifiers. Experiments across diverse reasoning tasks demonstrate that SELF-THOUGHT improves accuracy, robustness, and generalization for both large and small models, offering a scalable path toward more reliable self-correcting language systems."}

This theoretical framework provides a distinctive explanation for hallucination: even with optimal training, perfect data, and a simplified \"closed world\" setting, the information-theoretically optimal strategy under limited capacity is not to abstain or forget, but to assign high confidence to some non-facts, resulting in hallucination. We validate this theory empirically on synthetic data, showing that hallucinations persist as a natural consequence of lossy compression."}

To ensure the quality of extracted knowledge, we introduce a three-stage knowledge processing pipeline that combines vector-based filtering to remove exact duplicates, LLM-based adjudication to resolve ambiguous semantic overlaps, and domain-relevance auditing to retain valid knowledge units. Through extensive experiments, we find that recursive taxonomy is the most effective exploration strategy. We also observe a clear knowledge scaling law, where larger models consistently extract more knowledge. In addition, we identify a Pass@1-versus-Pass@k trade-off: domain-specialized models achieve higher initial accuracy but degrade rapidly, while general-purpose models maintain stable performance during extended extraction. Finally, our results show that differences in training data composition lead to distinct and measurable knowledge profiles across model families."}

Recently, natural language feedback derived from execution logs has shown promise as a way to identify how prompts can be improved. However, most prior approaches operate in a bottom-up manner, iteratively adjusting the prompt based on feedback from individual problems, which can cause them to lose the global perspective. In this work, we propose Error Taxonomy-Guided Prompt Optimization (ETGPO), a prompt optimization algorithm that adopts a top-down approach. ETGPO focuses on the global failure landscape by collecting model errors, categorizing them into a taxonomy, and augmenting the prompt with guidance targeting the most frequent failure modes. Across multiple benchmarks spanning mathematics, question answering, and logical reasoning, ETGPO achieves accuracy that is comparable to or better than state-of-the-art methods, while requiring roughly one third of the optimization-phase token usage and evaluation budget."}

Full-model fine-tuning is computationally expensive and prone to overfitting, while parameter-efficient methods like LoRA apply adaptation uniformly across layers, overlooking internal representations thus compromising effectiveness and efficiency. We analyze multilingual ASR models and reveal a U-shaped adaptability pattern: early and late layers are language-specific and require more adaptation, while intermediate layers retain shared semantics and need less. Building on this observation, we propose DAMA, a Depth-Aware Model Adaptation framework that allocates adaptation capacity according to each layer's role. DAMA also introduces Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based initialization to constrain adaptation and preserve the U-shaped pattern, as well as a frozen middle-layer basis for further efficiency. Evaluated on 18 low-resource languages across two benchmark datasets, DAMA matches or surpasses state-of-the-art accuracy with 80% fewer trainable parameters, achieves a 29% error reduction under extreme data scarcity, and significantly improves memory, training time, and computational efficiency over baselines.

We attribute this to a mismatch typical in current SFT-RL pipelines: the distribution that generates the offline SFT data can differ substantially from the policy optimized during online RL, which learns from its own rollouts.\n  We propose PEAR (Policy Evaluation-inspired Algorithm for Offline Learning Loss Re-weighting), an SFT-stage method that corrects this mismatch and better prepares the model for RL.

PEAR consistently improves post-RL performance over canonical SFT, with pass at 8 gains up to a 14.6 percent on AIME2025.

However, SAEs assume that features combine additively through linear reconstruction, an assumption that cannot capture compositional structure: linear models cannot distinguish whether \"Starbucks\" arises from the composition of \"star\" and \"coffee\" features or merely their co-occurrence. This forces SAEs to allocate monolithic features for compound concepts rather than decomposing them into interpretable constituents. We introduce PolySAE, which extends the SAE decoder with higher-order terms to model feature interactions while preserving the linear encoder essential for interpretability. Through low-rank tensor factorization on a shared projection subspace, PolySAE captures pairwise and triple feature interactions with small parameter overhead (3% on GPT2). Across four language models and three SAE variants, PolySAE achieves an average improvement of approximately 8% in probing F1 while maintaining comparable reconstruction error, and produces 2-10$\\times$ larger Wasserstein distances between class-conditional feature distributions. Critically, learned interaction weights exhibit negligible correlation with co-occurrence frequency ($r = 0.06$ vs. $r = 0.82$ for SAE feature covariance), suggesting that polynomial terms capture compositional structure, such as morphological binding and phrasal composition, largely independent of surface statistics."}

We study two debiasing strategies: adversarial training through gradient reversal and a causal bottleneck architecture that explicitly separates demographic and residual information. Demographic leakage is quantified using both linear and nonlinear probing classifiers, while speaker verification performance is evaluated using ROC-AUC and EER. Our results show that gender information is strongly and linearly encoded in baseline embeddings, whereas age and accent are weaker and primarily nonlinearly represented. Adversarial debiasing reduces gender leakage but has limited effect on age and accent and introduces a clear trade-off with verification accuracy. The causal bottleneck further suppresses demographic information, particularly in the residual representation, but incurs substantial performance degradation. These findings highlight fundamental limitations in mitigating demographic leakage in self-supervised speaker embeddings and clarify the trade-offs inherent in current debiasing approaches."}

We found (1) single-domain generalization is highly asymmetric: training on other domains improves math reasoning by approximately 25\\% accuracy, while yielding negligible transfer to logic and puzzle; (2) cross-domain interactions are highly order-dependent: training in the order math$\\rightarrow$science achieves 83\\% / 41\\% accuracy on math / science, while reversing the order to science$\\rightarrow$math degrades performance to 77\\% / 25\\%; (3) no single strategy is universally optimal in multi-domain training: sequential training favors math (up to 84\\%), mixed training favors science and logic, and poor ordering can incur large performance gaps (from 70\\% to 56\\%). Overall, our findings demonstrate that GRPO under multi-domain settings exhibits pronounced asymmetry, order sensitivity, and strategy dependence, highlighting the necessity of domain-aware and order-aware training design."}

In this work, we introduce Expected Harm, a metric that weights the severity of a jailbreak by its execution likelihood, modeled as a function of execution cost. Through empirical analysis of state-of-the-art models, we reveal a systematic Inverse Risk Calibration: models disproportionately exhibit stronger refusal behaviors for low-likelihood (high-cost) threats while remaining vulnerable to high-likelihood (low-cost) queries. We demonstrate that this miscalibration creates a structural vulnerability: by exploiting this property, we increase the attack success rate of existing jailbreaks by up to $2\\times$. Finally, we trace the root cause of this failure using linear probing, which reveals that while models encode severity in their latent space to drive refusal decisions, they possess no distinguishable internal representation of execution cost, making them \"blind\" to this critical dimension of risk."}

This study conducts a longitudinal analysis of outlier dynamics across architecture during NVFP4 pretraining, focusing on where they localize, why they occur, and how they evolve temporally. We find that, compared with Softmax Attention (SA), Linear Attention (LA) reduces per-tensor heavy tails but still exhibits persistent block-level spikes under block quantization. Our analysis attributes outliers to specific architectural components: Softmax in SA, gating in LA, and SwiGLU in FFN, with \"post-QK\" operations exhibiting higher sensitivity to quantization. Notably, outliers evolve from transient spikes early in training to a small set of persistent hot channels (i.e., channels with persistently large magnitudes) in later stages. Based on these findings, we introduce Hot-Channel Patch (HCP), an online compensation mechanism that identifies hot channels and reinjects residuals using hardware-efficient kernels. We then develop CHON, an NVFP4 training recipe integrating HCP with post-QK operation protection. On GLA-1.3B model trained for 60B tokens, CHON reduces the loss gap to BF16 from 0.94% to 0.58% while maintaining downstream accuracy."}

Our empirical results indicate that LLMs exhibit a myopic horizon, primarily conducting incremental transitions without precise global planning.

Masked diffusion-based language models (MDMs) exhibit this failure in a much weaker form, but the underlying reason has remained unclear. A common explanation attributes this mitigation to the any-order training objective. However, observing \"[MASK] is $B$\" during training does not necessarily teach the model to handle the reverse prompt \"$B$ is [MASK]\". We show that the mitigation arises from architectural structure and its interaction with training. In a one-layer Transformer encoder, weight sharing couples the two directions by making forward and reverse attention scores positively correlated. In the same setting, we further show that the corresponding gradients are aligned, so minimizing the forward loss also reduces the reverse loss. Experiments on both controlled toy tasks and large-scale diffusion language models support these mechanisms, explaining why MDMs partially overcome a failure mode that persists in strong ARMs."}

Additionally, there might not even exist a universally optimal loss function: differences in the structure and overlap of the forget and retain data can cause a loss to work well in one setting but over-unlearn or under-unlearn in another. Our approach EvoMU tackles these two challenges simultaneously. An evolutionary search procedure automatically finds task-specific losses in the vast space of possible unlearning loss functions.

However, popular coding benchmarks such as HumanEval and SWE-Bench focus on narrowly scoped tasks such as competition programming and patch generation. In reality, software engineers have to handle a broader set of tasks for real-world software development. To address this gap, we propose OmniCode, a novel software engineering benchmark that contains a broader and more diverse set of task categories beyond code or patch generation. Overall, OmniCode contains 1794 tasks spanning three programming languages (Python, Java, and C++) and four key categories: bug fixing, test generation, code review fixing, and style fixing. In contrast to prior software engineering benchmarks, the tasks in OmniCode are (1) manually validated to eliminate ill-defined problems, and (2) synthetically crafted or recently curated to avoid data leakage issues, presenting a new framework for synthetically generating diverse software tasks from limited real-world data. We evaluate OmniCode with popular agent frameworks such as SWE-Agent and show that while they may perform well on bug fixing for Python, they fall short on tasks such as Test Generation and in languages such as C++ and Java. For instance, SWE-Agent achieves a maximum of 20.9% with DeepSeek-V3.1 on Java Test Generation tasks. OmniCode aims to serve as a robust benchmark and spur the development of agents that can perform well across different aspects of software development.

However, their sophisticated capabilities also introduce severe safety concerns, particularly the generation of harmful content through jailbreak attacks. Current safety testing for LLMs often relies on static datasets and lacks systematic criteria to evaluate the quality and adequacy of these tests. While coverage criteria have been effective for smaller neural networks, they are not directly applicable to LLMs due to scalability issues and differing objectives. To address these challenges, this paper introduces RACA, a novel set of coverage criteria specifically designed for LLM safety testing. RACA leverages representation engineering to focus on safety-critical concepts within LLMs, thereby reducing dimensionality and filtering out irrelevant information. The framework operates in three stages: first, it identifies safety-critical representations using a small, expert-curated calibration set of jailbreak prompts. Second, it calculates conceptual activation scores for a given test suite based on these representations. Finally, it computes coverage results using six sub-criteria that assess both individual and compositional safety concepts. We conduct comprehensive experiments to validate RACA's effectiveness, applicability, and generalization, where the results demonstrate that RACA successfully identifies high-quality jailbreak prompts and is superior to traditional neuron-level criteria. We also showcase its practical application in real-world scenarios, such as test set prioritization and attack prompt sampling. Furthermore, our findings confirm RACA's generalization to various scenarios and its robustness across various configurations. Overall, RACA provides a new framework for evaluating the safety of LLMs, contributing a valuable technique to the field of testing for AI."}

Our end-to-end formal infrastructure implement the missing contents in latest Lean 4 Mathlib library, including a complete development of Gaussian Lipschitz concentration, the first formalization of Dudley's entropy integral theorem for sub-Gaussian processes, and an application to least-squares (sparse) regression with a sharp rate. The project was carried out using a human-AI collaborative workflow, in which humans design proof strategies and AI agents execute tactical proof construction, leading to the human-verified Lean 4 toolbox for SLT. Beyond implementation, the formalization process exposes and resolves implicit assumptions and missing details in standard SLT textbooks, enforcing a granular, line-by-line understanding of the theory. This work establishes a reusable formal foundation and opens the door for future developments in machine learning theory.

Yet, the internal mechanisms driving these complex reasoning behaviors remain opaque. Existing interpretability approaches targeting reasoning either identify components (e.g., neurons) correlated with special textual patterns, or rely on human-annotated contrastive pairs to derive control vectors. Consequently, current methods struggle to precisely localize complex reasoning mechanisms or capture sequential influence from model internal workings to the reasoning outputs. In this paper, built on outcome-oriented and sequential-influence-aware principles, we focus on identifying components that have sequential contribution to reasoning behavior where outcomes are cumulated by long-range effects. We propose Integrated Policy Gradient (IPG), a novel framework that attributes reasoning behaviors to model's inner components by propagating compound outcome-based signals such as post reasoning accuracy backward through model inference trajectories. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves more precise localization and enables reliable modulation of reasoning behaviors (e.g., reasoning capability, reasoning strength) across diverse reasoning models."}

Existing benchmarks typically assume well-specified instructions or restrict evaluation to text-only, single-turn clarification, and thus do not measure multi-turn disambiguation under grounded execution risk. We introduce \\textbf{Drift-Bench}, the first diagnostic benchmark that evaluates agentic pragmatics under input faults through multi-turn clarification across state-oriented and service-oriented execution environments. Grounded in classical theories of communication, \\textbf{Drift-Bench} provides a unified taxonomy of cooperative breakdowns and employs a persona-driven user simulator with the \\textbf{Rise} evaluation protocol. Experiments show substantial performance drops under these faults, with clarification effectiveness varying across user personas and fault types. \\MethodName bridges clarification research and agent safety evaluation, enabling systematic diagnosis of failures that can lead to unsafe executions."}

Existing agents often suffer from inaccurate element grounding, the absence of site-specific procedural knowledge, and unstable long-term task tracking and memory, particularly when operating over complex Document Object Model structures. To address these limitations, we introduce Avenir-Web, a web agent that achieves a new open-source state of the art on the Online-Mind2Web benchmark in real-world deployment. Avenir-Web leverages a Mixture of Grounding Experts, Experience-Imitation Planning for incorporating procedural priors, and a task-tracking checklist combined with adaptive memory to enable robust and seamless interaction across diverse user interface paradigms. We evaluate Avenir-Web on Online-Mind2Web, a rigorous benchmark of live and user-centered web tasks. Our results demonstrate that Avenir-Web significantly surpasses prior open-source agents and attains performance parity with top-tier proprietary models, thereby establishing a new open-source state of the art for reliable web agents on live websites."}

While prior work has extensively explored depth expansion, width expansion remains significantly understudied, with the few existing methods limited to the early stages of training. However, expanding width during the mid-stage is essential for maximizing computational savings, yet it remains a formidable challenge due to severe training instabilities. Empirically, we show that naive initialization at this stage disrupts activation statistics, triggering loss spikes, while copy-based initialization introduces gradient symmetry that hinders feature diversity. To address these issues, we propose SPARKLING (balancing {S}ignal {P}reservation {A}nd symmet{R}y brea{K}ing for width-progressive {L}earn{ING}), a novel framework for mid-stage width expansion. Our method achieves signal preservation via RMS-scale consistency, stabilizing activation statistics during expansion. Symmetry breaking is ensured through asymmetric optimizer state resetting and learning rate re-warmup. Extensive experiments on Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models demonstrate that, across multiple width axes and optimizer families, SPARKLING consistently outperforms training from scratch and reduces training cost by up to 35% under $2\\times$ width expansion."}

Moreover, our theory-motivated automatic environment adaptation improves training for both the reward and policy models by leveraging critic feedback from each, enabling learning from experience. Empirically, each added component consistently improves the overall system, and RLAnything yields substantial gains across various representative LLM and agentic tasks, boosting Qwen3-VL-8B-Thinking by 9.1% on OSWorld and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct by 18.7% and 11.9% on AlfWorld and LiveBench, respectively.
