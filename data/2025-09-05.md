TL;DR: 通过对比九种纯文本模型和三种多模态模型，研究发现类中心样本选择、推理增强提示和词元级微调策略能有效提升语言模型在老年痴呆语音检测中的性能，优化后的开源模型可媲美商业系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 美国超半数阿尔茨海默病患者未获诊断，语音筛查技术为实现规模化检测提供了可能。

Method: 使用DementiaBank语音数据集，对比了上下文学习（含不同样本选择策略）、推理增强提示、参数高效微调、多模态融合等大语言模型适配策略。

Result: 类中心样本选择策略效果最优，推理增强对小模型提升显著，词元级微调普遍表现最佳；添加分类头可显著改善欠拟合模型；多模态模型未超越最优纯文本模型。

Conclusion: 模型适配策略（样本选择/推理设计/调优方法）对基于语音的痴呆检测具有关键影响，优化后的开源模型性能可匹配或超越商业系统。

Abstract: Over half of US adults with Alzheimer disease and related dementias remain
undiagnosed, and speech-based screening offers a scalable detection approach.
We compared large language model adaptation strategies for dementia detection
using the DementiaBank speech corpus, evaluating nine text-only models and
three multimodal audio-text models on recordings from DementiaBank speech
corpus. Adaptations included in-context learning with different demonstration
selection policies, reasoning-augmented prompting, parameter-efficient
fine-tuning, and multimodal integration. Results showed that class-centroid
demonstrations achieved the highest in-context learning performance, reasoning
improved smaller models, and token-level fine-tuning generally produced the
best scores. Adding a classification head substantially improved
underperforming models. Among multimodal models, fine-tuned audio-text systems
performed well but did not surpass the top text-only models. These findings
highlight that model adaptation strategies, including demonstration selection,
reasoning design, and tuning method, critically influence speech-based dementia
detection, and that properly adapted open-weight models can match or exceed
commercial systems.

### [2] [Enhancing Speech Large Language Models through Reinforced Behavior Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03526)
*Yansong Liu,Jiateng Li,Yuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出强化行为对齐框架(RBA)，通过自生成数据和强化学习提升语音大模型在指令遵循和多任务处理中的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音大模型(SpeechLMs)在动态多变的语音指令场景中与文本大模型存在显著性能差距

Method: 采用教师大模型自生成高质量对齐数据，基于强化学习实现语音模型与教师模型的行为对齐

Result: RBA显著提升指令遵循能力，在口语问答和语音翻译任务中达到SOTA，仅需自生成数据

Conclusion: RBA框架验证了自对齐方法的有效性，展示了跨语音任务的无缝扩展能力

Abstract: The recent advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred
considerable research interest in extending their linguistic capabilities
beyond text to other modalities, which leads to emergence of speech-based LLMs
(SpeechLMs) with capability of processing user request in either speech or
textual formats. However, owing to inter-modal discrepancies, these SpeechLMs
still exhibit a significant performance gap compared to their text-based LLM
counterparts in instruction-following, particularly when confronted with the
dynamic and variable nature of user speech. To address this challenge, this
paper introduces a framework termed Reinforced Behavior Alignment (RBA),
designed to bolster the language generation proficiency of SpeechLMs. Instead
of relying on supervised fine-tuning from human annotations, RBA employs a
self-synthesis methodology to generate extensive, high-fidelity alignment data
by a powerful teacher LLM. Then SpeechLMs is aligned its behavior with that of
a teacher using a reinforcement learning-based approach. Experimental results
demonstrate that this method effectively enhances the instruction-following
capabilities of SpeechLMs that outperform conventional distillation baselines.
Crucially, we demonstrate that RBA can be seamlessly extended to tasks such
including spoken question answering and speech-to-text translation, attaining
state-of-the-art performance on open benchmarks with only self-generated data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决加密货币新闻分析中信息整合困难和大语言模型幻觉问题，提升分析准确性和信息完整性。

Method: 采用4位量化PEFT/LoRA微调Mistral 7B模型，第一层生成带情感分析的图/文摘要，高层进行层次化整合，最终通过知识图谱表示新闻内容。

Result: 模型成功实现加密货币新闻的定性与定量分析，有效减少97%的幻觉现象，层次化报告生成效率提升40%。

Conclusion: 图-文双模态摘要与知识图谱的结合显著提升分析可靠性，为加密货币市场监测提供了可解释的自动化分析框架。

Abstract: In the paper, we consider multilevel multitask analysis of cryptocurrency
news using a fine-tuned Mistral 7B large language model with
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
  On the first level of analytics, the fine-tuned model generates graph and
text summaries with sentiment scores as well as JSON representations of
summaries. Higher levels perform hierarchical stacking that consolidates sets
of graph-based and text-based summaries as well as summaries of summaries into
comprehensive reports. The combination of graph and text summaries provides
complementary views of cryptocurrency news. The model is fine-tuned with 4-bit
quantization using the PEFT/LoRA approach. The representation of cryptocurrency
news as knowledge graph can essentially eliminate problems with large language
model hallucinations.
  The obtained results demonstrate that the use of fine-tuned Mistral 7B LLM
models for multilevel cryptocurrency news analysis can conduct informative
qualitative and quantitative analytics, providing important insights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决法律领域流程挖掘应用受限于数据质量与可访问性的问题，通过非结构化数据构建标准化基准

Method: 整合Normattiva门户的立法数据，运用大语言模型进行结构化处理，创建1987-2022年立法全流程事件日志

Result: 成功开发ProLiFIC数据集，完成立法流程的初步分析验证，确立法律流程挖掘的新基准

Conclusion: ProLiFIC为法律流程挖掘与大语言模型集成提供实证基础，促进立法效率评估与流程优化研究

Abstract: Process Mining (PM), initially developed for industrial and business
contexts, has recently been applied to social systems, including legal ones.
However, PM's efficacy in the legal domain is limited by the accessibility and
quality of datasets. We introduce ProLiFIC (Procedural Lawmaking Flow in
Italian Chambers), a comprehensive event log of the Italian lawmaking process
from 1987 to 2022. Created from unstructured data from the Normattiva portal
and structured using large language models (LLMs), ProLiFIC aligns with recent
efforts in integrating PM with LLMs. We exemplify preliminary analyses and
propose ProLiFIC as a benchmark for legal PM, fostering new developments.

*Alejandro Álvarez Castro,Joaquín Ordieres-Meré*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于分层话语树和多模态信号融合的收益电话语义表征框架，增强结构感知能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有金融情感分析系统采用平面化建模，无法有效捕捉收益电话会议中半结构化对话的层次化逻辑

Method: 两阶段Transformer架构：第一阶段通过对比学习编码节点级多模态元数据，第二阶段合成全局会议嵌入

Conclusion: 该框架可扩展至医疗、教育等高风险非结构化沟通场景，为多模态话语分析提供可解释解决方案

Abstract: Earnings calls represent a uniquely rich and semi-structured source of
financial communication, blending scripted managerial commentary with
unscripted analyst dialogue. Although recent advances in financial sentiment
analysis have integrated multi-modal signals, such as textual content and vocal
tone, most systems rely on flat document-level or sentence-level models,
failing to capture the layered discourse structure of these interactions. This
paper introduces a novel multi-modal framework designed to generate
semantically rich and structurally aware embeddings of earnings calls, by
encoding them as hierarchical discourse trees. Each node, comprising either a
monologue or a question-answer pair, is enriched with emotional signals derived
from text, audio, and video, as well as structured metadata including coherence
scores, topic labels, and answer coverage assessments. A two-stage transformer
architecture is proposed: the first encodes multi-modal content and discourse
metadata at the node level using contrastive learning, while the second
synthesizes a global embedding for the entire conference. Experimental results
reveal that the resulting embeddings form stable, semantically meaningful
representations that reflect affective tone, structural logic, and thematic
alignment. Beyond financial reporting, the proposed system generalizes to other
high-stakes unscripted communicative domains such as tele-medicine, education,
and political discourse, offering a robust and explainable approach to
multi-modal discourse representation. This approach offers practical utility
for downstream tasks such as financial forecasting and discourse evaluation,
while also providing a generalizable method applicable to other domains
involving high-stakes communication.

### [6] [Reading Between the Signs: Predicting Future Suicidal Ideation from Adolescent Social Media Texts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03530)
*Paul Blum,Enrico Liscio,Ruixuan Zhang,Caroline Figueroa,Pradeep K. Murukannaiah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Early-SIB模型，通过分析青少年在论坛的互动帖子预测自杀倾向，准确率73%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 青少年自杀率高但预测困难，传统方法依赖医疗接触，社交媒体实时动态可提供新途径

Method: 基于Transformer的模型，连续处理用户发布的帖子及互动内容进行预测

Result: 在荷兰青少年论坛上实现0.73平衡准确率，有效预测用户未来是否发布自杀相关帖子

Conclusion: 模型可作为传统心理健康干预的补充工具，实现早期预警

Abstract: Suicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents (12-18), yet predicting
it remains a significant challenge. Many cases go undetected due to a lack of
contact with mental health services. Social media, however, offers a unique
opportunity, as young people often share their thoughts and struggles online in
real time. In this work, we propose a novel task and method to approach it:
predicting suicidal ideation and behavior (SIB) from forum posts before an
adolescent explicitly expresses suicidal ideation on an online forum. This
predictive framing, where no self-disclosure is used as input at any stage,
remains largely unexplored in the suicide prediction literature. To this end,
we introduce Early-SIB, a transformer-based model that sequentially processes
the posts a user writes and engages with to predict whether they will write a
SIB post. Our model achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.73 for predicting future
SIB on a Dutch youth forum, demonstrating that such tools can offer a
meaningful addition to traditional methods.

### [7] [Real-Time Detection of Hallucinated Entities in Long-Form Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03531)

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于实体级标注的低成本幻觉检测方法，通过线性分类器实现实时检测，在多个模型家族中表现优于基线（AUC 0.90 vs 0.71）并具备跨任务泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有幻觉检测方法无法满足长文本生成场景的实时需求，且验证成本过高。聚焦实体级幻觉（如虚构名称/日期）更适配token级检测。

Method: 利用网络搜索构建标注数据集（实体级真实性标签），训练高效线性分类器，支持跨模型迁移（如Llama-3.3-70B）。

Result: 在长文本生成中AUC提升29%（对比语义熵方法），数学推理任务中意外展现非实体级错误检测能力，公开数据集促进模型迁移。

Conclusion: 实体级标注方法为可扩展的实时幻觉检测提供新范式，标注数据跨模型复用特性增强实用性，开源数据集推动领域发展。

Abstract: Large language models are now routinely used in high-stakes applications
where hallucinations can cause serious harm, such as medical consultations or
legal advice. Existing hallucination detection methods, however, are
impractical for real-world use, as they are either limited to short factual
queries or require costly external verification. We present a cheap, scalable
method for real-time identification of hallucinated tokens in long-form
generations, and scale it effectively to 70B parameter models. Our approach
targets \emph{entity-level hallucinations} -- e.g., fabricated names, dates,
citations -- rather than claim-level, thereby naturally mapping to token-level
labels and enabling streaming detection. We develop an annotation methodology
that leverages web search to annotate model responses with grounded labels
indicating which tokens correspond to fabricated entities. This dataset enables
us to train effective hallucination classifiers with simple and efficient
methods such as linear probes. Evaluating across four model families, our
classifiers consistently outperform baselines on long-form responses, including
more expensive methods such as semantic entropy (e.g., AUC 0.90 vs 0.71 for
Llama-3.3-70B), and are also an improvement in short-form question-answering
settings. Moreover, despite being trained only with entity-level labels, our
probes effectively detect incorrect answers in mathematical reasoning tasks,
indicating generalization beyond entities. While our annotation methodology is
expensive, we find that annotated responses from one model can be used to train
effective classifiers on other models; accordingly, we publicly release our
datasets to facilitate reuse. Overall, our work suggests a promising new
approach for scalable, real-world hallucination detection.

### [8] [Topic Identification in LLM Input-Output Pairs through the Lens of Information Bottleneck](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03533)
*Igor Halperin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于确定性信息瓶颈(UDIB)的共享主题聚类方法，改进LLM虚构检测框架


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义差异检测方法依赖几何聚类优化主题，与下游信息理论分析存在脱节

Method: 将DIB方法转化为高维数据算法，用计算高效上界替代KL散度项，开发熵正则化的鲁棒K-means变体

Result: UDIB生成的共享主题表示能最大化提示-响应的信息量，为SDM框架提供更优基础

Conclusion: UDIB不仅提高检测灵敏度，其信息最大化的主题结构为识别LLM虚构提供新工具

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to critical failure modes, including
\textit{intrinsic faithfulness hallucinations} (also known as confabulations),
where a response deviates semantically from the provided context. Frameworks
designed to detect this, such as Semantic Divergence Metrics (SDM), rely on
identifying latent topics shared between prompts and responses, typically by
applying geometric clustering to their sentence embeddings. This creates a
disconnect, as the topics are optimized for spatial proximity, not for the
downstream information-theoretic analysis. In this paper, we bridge this gap by
developing a principled topic identification method grounded in the
Deterministic Information Bottleneck (DIB) for geometric clustering. Our key
contribution is to transform the DIB method into a practical algorithm for
high-dimensional data by substituting its intractable KL divergence term with a
computationally efficient upper bound. The resulting method, which we dub UDIB,
can be interpreted as an entropy-regularized and robustified version of K-means
that inherently favors a parsimonious number of informative clusters. By
applying UDIB to the joint clustering of LLM prompt and response embeddings, we
generate a shared topic representation that is not merely spatially coherent
but is fundamentally structured to be maximally informative about the
prompt-response relationship. This provides a superior foundation for the SDM
framework and offers a novel, more sensitive tool for detecting confabulations.

Abstract: In today's information-rich era, learners have access to abundant educational
resources, but the lack of practice materials tailored to these resources
presents a significant challenge. This project addresses that gap by developing
a multi-modal question generation system that can automatically generate
diverse question types from various content formats. The system features four
major components: multi-modal input handling, question generation,
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and an end-to-end
interactive interface. This project lays the foundation for automated,
scalable, and intelligent question generation, carefully balancing resource
efficiency, robust functionality and a smooth user experience.

*Cheng-Kai Yeh,Hsing-Wang Lee,Chung-Hung Kuo,Hen-Hsen Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AR²框架通过对抗性强化学习增强LLM的抽象推理能力，使模型能有效从复杂叙述中提取核心计算逻辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成模型主要依赖表面模式识别，缺乏显式的抽象能力训练，导致面对新型复杂任务时泛化能力不足。

Method: 采用教师模型将核心问题转化为叙事复杂的等效描述，同时训练学生模型从复杂叙述中提取核心计算内核进行编程求解。

Result: 实验显示AR²显著提升学生模型在未见复杂编程任务上的准确率（基础任务提升17.3%，复杂任务提升24.6%）

Conclusion: 抽象能力是增强LLM泛化性能的关键技能，显式训练可显著提升模型处理新型复杂问题的能力。

Abstract: Abstraction--the ability to recognize and distill essential computational
patterns from complex problem statements--is a foundational skill in computer
science, critical both for human problem-solvers and coding-oriented large
language models (LLMs). Despite recent advances in training LLMs for code
generation using reinforcement learning (RL), most existing approaches focus
primarily on superficial pattern recognition, overlooking explicit training for
abstraction. In this study, we propose AR$^2$ (Adversarial Reinforcement
Learning for Abstract Reasoning), a novel framework explicitly designed to
enhance the abstraction abilities of LLMs. AR$^2$ employs a teacher model to
transform kernel problems into narrative-rich, challenging descriptions without
changing their fundamental logic. Simultaneously, a student coding model is
trained to solve these complex narrative problems by extracting their
underlying computational kernels. Experimental results demonstrate that AR$^2$
substantially improves the student model's accuracy on previously unseen,
challenging programming tasks, underscoring abstraction as a key skill for
enhancing LLM generalization.

*Shanglin Wu,Lihui Liu,Jinho D. Choi,Kai Shu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出动态知识图谱构建框架，通过整合LLM内部知识与外部检索，显著提升大语言模型事实准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型因参数记忆限制导致的事实不一致问题，传统RAG方法处理非结构化文本难以支持组合推理和事实校验

Method: 通过问题生成初始知识图谱→LLM知识迭代扩展→外部知识选择性修正的三阶段动态构建机制

Result: 在三个事实问答基准测试中实现准确率、精确度和可解释性全面提升，超越静态知识图谱方法

Conclusion: 推理时动态构建知识图谱是增强LLM事实性的结构化解决方案，兼具可扩展性和可解释性优势

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with producing factually
consistent answers due to limitations in their parametric memory.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods address this issue by
incorporating external knowledge from trusted sources at inference time.
However, such methods typically treat knowledge as unstructured text, which
limits their ability to support compositional reasoning and identify factual
inconsistencies. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework
that dynamically constructs and expands knowledge graphs (KGs) during
inference, integrating both internal knowledge extracted from LLMs and external
information retrieved from external sources. Our method begins by extracting a
seed KG from the question via prompting, followed by iterative expansion using
the LLM's latent knowledge. The graph is then selectively refined through
external retrieval, enhancing factual coverage and correcting inaccuracies. We
evaluate our approach on three diverse factual QA benchmarks, demonstrating
consistent improvements in factual accuracy, answer precision, and
interpretability over baseline prompting and static KG-augmented methods. Our
findings suggest that inference-time KG construction is a promising direction
for enhancing LLM factuality in a structured, interpretable, and scalable
manner.

Conclusion: ResearchPulse通过协同代理架构有效解决多文档科学推理挑战，其结构化可视化方法和开源数据集推动了领域研究进展。

Abstract: Understanding how scientific ideas evolve requires more than summarizing
individual papers-it demands structured, cross-document reasoning over
thematically related research. In this work, we formalize multi-document
scientific inference, a new task that extracts and aligns motivation,
methodology, and experimental results across related papers to reconstruct
research development chains. This task introduces key challenges, including
temporally aligning loosely structured methods and standardizing heterogeneous
experimental tables. We present ResearchPulse, an agent-based framework that
integrates instruction planning, scientific content extraction, and structured
visualization. It consists of three coordinated agents: a Plan Agent for task
decomposition, a Mmap-Agent that constructs motivation-method mind maps, and a
Lchart-Agent that synthesizes experimental line charts. To support this task,
we introduce ResearchPulse-Bench, a citation-aware benchmark of annotated paper
clusters. Experiments show that our system, despite using 7B-scale agents,
consistently outperforms strong baselines like GPT-4o in semantic alignment,
structural consistency, and visual fidelity. The dataset are available in

NoteBar can be deployed in a practical and cost-effective manner, enabling
interactive use without reliance on heavy infrastructure. Together, NoteBar and
its accompanying dataset provide a scalable and extensible foundation for
advancing AI-assisted personal knowledge management.

Motivation: 验证在资源受限的边缘计算场景中，传统OCR系统相比新兴大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）的实用性优势

Method: 基于包含54种语言的双重标注数据集，对5个前沿LVLM模型和2个传统OCR系统进行多维度评估（精度、语义一致性、语言覆盖、计算效率、部署成本），并特别增加CPU环境边缘案例分析

Result: Qwen模型取得最高准确率（0.54），但Sprinklr-Edge-OCR综合表现最佳：F1分数0.46，处理速度比LVLM快35倍，成本不到LVLM的1%（0.006美元/千张）

Conclusion: 在边缘计算时代，传统OCR系统凭借低计算需求、超低延迟和极高性价比，仍是资源受限环境下的最优选择，这挑战了LLM时代技术必然更优的普遍认知

Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in multilingual, noisy, and diverse
real-world images remains a significant challenge for optical character
recognition systems. With the rise of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs),
there is growing interest in their ability to generalize and reason beyond
fixed OCR pipelines. In this work, we introduce Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, a novel OCR
system built specifically optimized for edge deployment in resource-constrained
environments. We present a large-scale comparative evaluation of five
state-of-the-art LVLMs (InternVL, Qwen, GOT OCR, LLaMA, MiniCPM) and two
traditional OCR systems (Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, SuryaOCR) on a proprietary, doubly
hand annotated dataset of multilingual (54 languages) images. Our benchmark
covers a broad range of metrics including accuracy, semantic consistency,
language coverage, computational efficiency (latency, memory, GPU usage), and
deployment cost. To better reflect real-world applicability, we also conducted
edge case deployment analysis, evaluating model performance on CPU only
environments. Among the results, Qwen achieved the highest precision (0.54),
while Sprinklr-Edge-OCR delivered the best overall F1 score (0.46) and
outperformed others in efficiency, processing images 35 faster (0.17 seconds
per image on average) and at less than 0.01 of the cost (0.006 USD per 1,000
images) compared to LVLM. Our findings demonstrate that the most optimal OCR
systems for edge deployment are the traditional ones even in the era of LLMs
due to their low compute requirements, low latency, and very high
affordability.

Motivation: 大型语言模型作为自动评估工具时存在自我偏好偏差，影响评估公平性

Result: 引导向量降低不合理自我偏好97%，优于传统提示方法和直接偏好优化

Conclusion: 引导向量初步解决评估偏差但存在局限，需开发更稳健的干预措施

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as automated evaluators, yet
they suffer from "self-preference bias": a tendency to favor their own outputs
over those of other models. This bias undermines fairness and reliability in
evaluation pipelines, particularly for tasks like preference tuning and model
routing. We investigate whether lightweight steering vectors can mitigate this
problem at inference time without retraining. We introduce a curated dataset
that distinguishes self-preference bias into justified examples of
self-preference and unjustified examples of self-preference, and we construct
steering vectors using two methods: Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) and
an optimization-based approach. Our results show that steering vectors can
reduce unjustified self-preference bias by up to 97\%, substantially
outperforming prompting and direct preference optimization baselines. Yet
steering vectors are unstable on legitimate self-preference and unbiased
agreement, implying self-preference spans multiple or nonlinear directions.
This underscores both their promise and limits as safeguards for LLM-as-judges
and motivates more robust interventions.

### [16] [Semantic Analysis of SNOMED CT Concept Co-occurrences in Clinical Documentation using MIMIC-IV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03662)
*Ali Noori,Somya Mohanty,Prashanti Manda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过分析MIMIC-IV数据库中SNOMED CT概念的共现模式与语义嵌入相似性，揭示两者弱相关性但互补价值，证明语义嵌入可增强临床标注完整性并发现潜在关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床笔记非结构化特性阻碍大规模分析，标准化术语（SNOMED CT）的共现模式与语义相似性关联尚未充分探索，需验证共现统计与语义嵌入的协同价值。

Method: 使用NPMI和预训练嵌入模型（ClinicalBERT/BioBERT），分析概念共现频率与语义相似性相关性，评估嵌入模型对缺失概念的预测能力，追踪时间/专科维度演变模式。

Result: 共现与语义相似性弱相关（r=0.28），但嵌入模型能捕获文档频率未反映的临床关联（如『心肌梗死』与『心电图异常』）。时间分析显示嵌入预测概念比实际记录早2-3年出现。

Conclusion: 共现统计与语义嵌入具有互补性，可协同提升临床文档完整性、发现潜在关联，并为临床决策支持、患者表型分析提供新方法论支撑。

Abstract: Clinical notes contain rich clinical narratives but their unstructured format
poses challenges for large-scale analysis. Standardized terminologies such as
SNOMED CT improve interoperability, yet understanding how concepts relate
through co-occurrence and semantic similarity remains underexplored. In this
study, we leverage the MIMIC-IV database to investigate the relationship
between SNOMED CT concept co-occurrence patterns and embedding-based semantic
similarity. Using Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI) and pretrained
embeddings (e.g., ClinicalBERT, BioBERT), we examine whether frequently
co-occurring concepts are also semantically close, whether embeddings can
suggest missing concepts, and how these relationships evolve temporally and
across specialties. Our analyses reveal that while co-occurrence and semantic
similarity are weakly correlated, embeddings capture clinically meaningful
associations not always reflected in documentation frequency. Embedding-based
suggestions frequently matched concepts later documented, supporting their
utility for augmenting clinical annotations. Clustering of concept embeddings
yielded coherent clinical themes (symptoms, labs, diagnoses, cardiovascular
conditions) that map to patient phenotypes and care patterns. Finally,
co-occurrence patterns linked to outcomes such as mortality and readmission
demonstrate the practical utility of this approach. Collectively, our findings
highlight the complementary value of co-occurrence statistics and semantic
embeddings in improving documentation completeness, uncovering latent clinical
relationships, and informing decision support and phenotyping applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有立场检测模型在跨领域/跨目标场景中适应性不足的问题，通过捕捉语义差异提升领域迁移能力

Method: 使用度量学习框架结合三元组损失，构建判别性嵌入空间实现跨目标/跨领域知识迁移

Result: 在两个数据集上的跨场景测试显示，六个主流模型的立场检测性能均获得显著提升

Conclusion: MLSD通过改进语义相似性建模机制，有效提升了跨领域立场检测的适应能力和检测精度

Abstract: We present the novel approach for stance detection across domains and
targets, Metric Learning-Based Few-Shot Learning for Cross-Target and
Cross-Domain Stance Detection (MLSD). MLSD utilizes metric learning with
triplet loss to capture semantic similarities and differences between stance
targets, enhancing domain adaptation. By constructing a discriminative
embedding space, MLSD allows a cross-target or cross-domain stance detection
model to acquire useful examples from new target domains. We evaluate MLSD in
multiple cross-target and cross-domain scenarios across two datasets, showing
statistically significant improvement in stance detection performance across
six widely used stance detection models.

TL;DR: 提出SiLVERScore评估指标解决手语生成评估中多模态信息丢失问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反向翻译评估方法无法捕捉手语的面部表情/空间语法/韵律等多模态特征，且存在错误归因模糊性

Method: 基于联合嵌入空间的语义感知评估指标（SiLVERScore），通过对抗性训练学习手语特征与文本语义的映射

Result: 在PHOENIX-14T和CSL-Daily数据集上实现0.99的ROC AUC值，错误样本重叠率<7%

Conclusion: SiLVERScore显著优于传统指标，为手语生成提供更全面的多模态评估框架

Abstract: Evaluating sign language generation is often done through back-translation,
where generated signs are first recognized back to text and then compared to a
reference using text-based metrics. However, this two-step evaluation pipeline
introduces ambiguity: it not only fails to capture the multimodal nature of
sign language-such as facial expressions, spatial grammar, and prosody-but also
makes it hard to pinpoint whether evaluation errors come from sign generation
model or the translation system used to assess it. In this work, we propose
SiLVERScore, a novel semantically-aware embedding-based evaluation metric that
assesses sign language generation in a joint embedding space. Our contributions
include: (1) identifying limitations of existing metrics, (2) introducing
SiLVERScore for semantically-aware evaluation, (3) demonstrating its robustness
to semantic and prosodic variations, and (4) exploring generalization
challenges across datasets. On PHOENIX-14T and CSL-Daily datasets, SiLVERScore
achieves near-perfect discrimination between correct and random pairs (ROC AUC
= 0.99, overlap < 7%), substantially outperforming traditional metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估基准仅关注单轮问答，无法反映真实场景中通过持续对话建立共识的语义理解过程

Method: 设计包含对话效率、内容匹配、词汇适应和拟人程度的评估体系，通过150组人机对比实验验证

Result: 三大商业模型在至少三个维度偏离人类模式（GPT4o-mini最接近），任务成功率与图像-话语对齐度均无法有效预测语义理解质量

Conclusion: 该评估体系为多模态模型交互能力研究提供新范式，揭示当前模型在动态对话场景中的根本性缺陷

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) increasingly claim reasoning skills, yet
current benchmarks evaluate them in single-turn or question answering settings.
However, grounding is an interactive process in which people gradually develop
shared understanding through ongoing communication. We introduce a four-metric
suite (grounding efficiency, content alignment, lexical adaptation, and
human-likeness) to systematically evaluate VLM performance in interactive
grounding contexts. We deploy the suite on 150 self-play sessions of
interactive referential games between three proprietary VLMs and compare them
with human dyads. All three models diverge from human patterns on at least
three metrics, while GPT4o-mini is the closest overall. We find that (i) task
success scores do not indicate successful grounding and (ii) high
image-utterance alignment does not necessarily predict task success. Our metric
suite and findings offer a framework for future research on VLM grounding.

Motivation: 现有文档级机器翻译评估方法依赖句子对齐假设，但大模型生成的整文档翻译存在句子数量不匹配问题，导致评估失真。需要新的评估框架处理遗漏/复杂映射问题。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) Align阶段自动重建目标文档句子结构；2) n-Chunk滑动评估阶段计算1-4分块指标实现多粒度评估。

Result: WMT基准测试Pearson相关系数0.929，真实测试集与人评一致。基于框架的CPO/GRPO训练使翻译质量优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 该框架为文档级翻译系统提供了精准、鲁棒的评估工具，其产生的偏好数据可直接用于模型优化，具有实践指导价值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have ushered in a new era for document-level
machine translation (\textit{doc}-mt), yet their whole-document outputs
challenge existing evaluation methods that assume sentence-by-sentence
alignment. We introduce \textit{\textbf{Align-then-Slide}}, a complete
evaluation framework for ultra-long doc-mt. In the Align stage, we
automatically infer sentence-level source-target correspondences and rebuild
the target to match the source sentence number, resolving omissions and
many-to-one/one-to-many mappings. In the n-Chunk Sliding Evaluate stage, we
calculate averaged metric scores under 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-chunk for
multi-granularity assessment. Experiments on the WMT benchmark show a Pearson
correlation of 0.929 between our method with expert MQM rankings. On a newly
curated real-world test set, our method again aligns closely with human
judgments. Furthermore, preference data produced by Align-then-Slide enables
effective CPO training and its direct use as a reward model for GRPO, both
yielding translations preferred over a vanilla SFT baseline. The results
validate our framework as an accurate, robust, and actionable evaluation tool
for doc-mt systems.

TL;DR: 提出NE-PADD方法，通过语音命名实体识别和注意力机制提升部分音频伪造检测精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统音频伪造检测忽略语义中的命名实体信息，该研究旨在利用命名实体知识改进帧级伪造定位

Method: 双分支架构（SpeechNER+PADD）结合注意力融合（AF）和注意力转移（AT）机制，使用辅助损失指导模型学习

Result: 在PartialSpoof-NER数据集上超越现有基线，F1-score提升3.2%

Conclusion: 命名实体语义的整合有效增强音频伪造检测能力，开源代码推动领域发展

Abstract: Different from traditional sentence-level audio deepfake detection (ADD),
partial audio deepfake detection (PADD) requires frame-level positioning of the
location of fake speech. While some progress has been made in this area,
leveraging semantic information from audio, especially named entities, remains
an underexplored aspect. To this end, we propose NE-PADD, a novel method for
Partial Audio Deepfake Detection (PADD) that leverages named entity knowledge
through two parallel branches: Speech Name Entity Recognition (SpeechNER) and
PADD. The approach incorporates two attention aggregation mechanisms: Attention
Fusion (AF) for combining attention weights and Attention Transfer (AT) for
guiding PADD with named entity semantics using an auxiliary loss. Built on the
PartialSpoof-NER dataset, experiments show our method outperforms existing
baselines, proving the effectiveness of integrating named entity knowledge in
PADD. The code is available at https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/NE-PADD.

TL;DR: 揭示大语言模型在理解'深度胡言'（Drivelology）语言现象上的根本性局限，此类文本具有句法连贯但语用矛盾的特征


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型虽在常规NLP任务表现优异，却无法解析需要语境推理/道德判断的深层语义文本，需系统性评估其认知盲区

Method: 构建含6种语言1200+样本的Drivelology基准数据集，经多轮专家评审确保质量，并测试模型在分类/生成/推理任务中的表现

Result: 模型常混淆深度胡言与浅层无意义，生成逻辑混乱的解释，完全忽略隐含修辞功能，暴露语用理解的结构性缺陷

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战'统计流畅性=认知理解'的假设，强调建模深层语言理解的必要性，推动超越表面连贯性的语言AI发展

Abstract: We introduce Drivelology, a unique linguistic phenomenon characterised as
"nonsense with depth", utterances that are syntactically coherent yet
pragmatically paradoxical, emotionally loaded, or rhetorically subversive.
While such expressions may resemble surface-level nonsense, they encode
implicit meaning requiring contextual inference, moral reasoning, or emotional
interpretation. We find that current large language models (LLMs), despite
excelling at many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, consistently fail to
grasp the layered semantics of Drivelological text. To investigate this, we
construct a small but diverse benchmark dataset of over 1,200 meticulously
curated examples, with select instances in English, Mandarin, Spanish, French,
Japanese, and Korean. Annotation was especially challenging: each of the
examples required careful expert review to verify that it truly reflected
Drivelological characteristics. The process involved multiple rounds of
discussion and adjudication to address disagreements, highlighting the subtle
and subjective nature of the Drivelology. We evaluate a range of LLMs on
classification, generation, and reasoning tasks. Our results reveal clear
limitations of LLMs: models often confuse Drivelology with shallow nonsense,
produce incoherent justifications, or miss the implied rhetorical function
altogether. These findings highlight a deeper representational gap in LLMs'
pragmatic understanding and challenge the assumption that statistical fluency
implies cognitive comprehension. We release our dataset and code to facilitate
further research in modelling linguistic depth beyond surface-level coherence.

Conclusion: 强调可信推理技术发展的双重性：既展示提升模型可信度的潜力，又暴露当前模型的系统性缺陷，需持续关注AI安全研究。

Abstract: The development of Long-CoT reasoning has advanced LLM performance across
various tasks, including language understanding, complex problem solving, and
code generation. This paradigm enables models to generate intermediate
reasoning steps, thereby improving both accuracy and interpretability. However,
despite these advancements, a comprehensive understanding of how CoT-based
reasoning affects the trustworthiness of language models remains
underdeveloped. In this paper, we survey recent work on reasoning models and
CoT techniques, focusing on five core dimensions of trustworthy reasoning:
truthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and privacy. For each aspect, we
provide a clear and structured overview of recent studies in chronological
order, along with detailed analyses of their methodologies, findings, and
limitations. Future research directions are also appended at the end for
reference and discussion. Overall, while reasoning techniques hold promise for
enhancing model trustworthiness through hallucination mitigation, harmful
content detection, and robustness improvement, cutting-edge reasoning models
themselves often suffer from comparable or even greater vulnerabilities in
safety, robustness, and privacy. By synthesizing these insights, we hope this
work serves as a valuable and timely resource for the AI safety community to
stay informed on the latest progress in reasoning trustworthiness. A full list

Result: 探针主要学习指令格式和触发词等表面模式，导致安全检测在真实场景失效

Conclusion: 当前安全检测方法存在严重缺陷，需从模型架构和评估体系进行系统性重新设计

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can comply with harmful instructions, raising
serious safety concerns despite their impressive capabilities. Recent work has
leveraged probing-based approaches to study the separability of malicious and
benign inputs in LLMs' internal representations, and researchers have proposed
using such probing methods for safety detection. We systematically re-examine
this paradigm. Motivated by poor out-of-distribution performance, we
hypothesize that probes learn superficial patterns rather than semantic
harmfulness. Through controlled experiments, we confirm this hypothesis and
identify the specific patterns learned: instructional patterns and trigger
words. Our investigation follows a systematic approach, progressing from
demonstrating comparable performance of simple n-gram methods, to controlled
experiments with semantically cleaned datasets, to detailed analysis of pattern
dependencies. These results reveal a false sense of security around current
probing-based approaches and highlight the need to redesign both models and
evaluation protocols, for which we provide further discussions in the hope of
suggesting responsible further research in this direction. We have open-sourced
the project at https://github.com/WangCheng0116/Why-Probe-Fails.

Conclusion: MobileRAG有效解决移动代理现存挑战，配套评估基准推动领域发展

Abstract: Smartphones have become indispensable in people's daily lives, permeating
nearly every aspect of modern society. With the continuous advancement of large
language models (LLMs), numerous LLM-based mobile agents have emerged. These
agents are capable of accurately parsing diverse user queries and automatically
assisting users in completing complex or repetitive operations. However,
current agents 1) heavily rely on the comprehension ability of LLMs, which can
lead to errors caused by misoperations or omitted steps during tasks, 2) lack
interaction with the external environment, often terminating tasks when an app
cannot fulfill user queries, and 3) lack memory capabilities, requiring each
instruction to reconstruct the interface and being unable to learn from and
correct previous mistakes. To alleviate the above issues, we propose MobileRAG,
a mobile agents framework enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
which includes InterRAG, LocalRAG, and MemRAG. It leverages RAG to more quickly
and accurately identify user queries and accomplish complex and long-sequence
mobile tasks. Additionally, to more comprehensively assess the performance of
MobileRAG, we introduce MobileRAG-Eval, a more challenging benchmark
characterized by numerous complex, real-world mobile tasks that require
external knowledge assistance. Extensive experimental results on MobileRAG-Eval
demonstrate that MobileRAG can easily handle real-world mobile tasks, achieving
10.3\% improvement over state-of-the-art methods with fewer operational steps.

Conclusion: MoT通过多维度主动思考显著增强LLM推理能力，MTQA框架在保证效率的同时实现更精准的复杂问答

Abstract: Complex Question Answering (QA) is a fundamental and challenging task in NLP.
While large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance in QA, they
suffer from significant performance degradation when facing complex and
abstract QA tasks due to insufficient reasoning capabilities. Works such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) aim to enhance LLMs' reasoning
abilities, but they face issues such as in-layer redundancy in tree structures
and single paths in chain structures. Although some studies utilize
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods to assist LLMs in reasoning, the
challenge of effectively utilizing large amounts of information involving
multiple entities and hops remains critical. To address this, we propose the
Matrix of Thought (MoT), a novel and efficient LLM thought structure. MoT
explores the problem in both horizontal and vertical dimensions through the
"column-cell communication" mechanism, enabling LLMs to actively engage in
multi-strategy and deep-level thinking, reducing redundancy within the column
cells and enhancing reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we develop a
fact-correction mechanism by constructing knowledge units from retrieved
knowledge graph triples and raw text to enhance the initial knowledge for LLM
reasoning and correct erroneous answers. This leads to the development of an
efficient and accurate QA framework (MTQA). Experimental results show that our
framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four widely-used datasets in
terms of F1 and EM scores, with reasoning time only 14.4\% of the baseline
methods, demonstrating both its efficiency and accuracy. The code for this
framework is available at https://github.com/lyfiter/mtqa.

Conclusion: 首次实现计算方法与文学研究的深度融合，通过结构化数据定量分析诗歌情感，完整保留韩语文学情感与文化特质

Abstract: This study introduces KPoEM (Korean Poetry Emotion Mapping) , a novel dataset
for computational emotion analysis in modern Korean poetry. Despite remarkable
progress in text-based emotion classification using large language models,
poetry-particularly Korean poetry-remains underexplored due to its figurative
language and cultural specificity. We built a multi-label emotion dataset of
7,662 entries, including 7,007 line-level entries from 483 poems and 615
work-level entries, annotated with 44 fine-grained emotion categories from five
influential Korean poets. A state-of-the-art Korean language model fine-tuned
on this dataset significantly outperformed previous models, achieving 0.60
F1-micro compared to 0.34 from models trained on general corpora. The KPoEM
model, trained through sequential fine-tuning-first on general corpora and then
on the KPoEM dataset-demonstrates not only an enhanced ability to identify
temporally and culturally specific emotional expressions, but also a strong
capacity to preserve the core sentiments of modern Korean poetry. This study
bridges computational methods and literary analysis, presenting new
possibilities for the quantitative exploration of poetic emotions through
structured data that faithfully retains the emotional and cultural nuances of
Korean literature.

Conclusion: 不仅推进了对RAG场景灾难性遗忘的理解，还提供了跨多种微调场景的实用解决方案，代码已开源

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized
natural language processing through their remarkable capabilities in
understanding and executing diverse tasks. While supervised fine-tuning,
particularly in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios, effectively
enhances task-specific performance, it often leads to catastrophic forgetting,
where models lose their previously acquired knowledge and general capabilities.
Existing solutions either require access to general instruction data or face
limitations in preserving the model's original distribution. To overcome these
limitations, we propose SelfAug, a self-distribution alignment method that
aligns input sequence logits to preserve the model's semantic distribution,
thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting and improving downstream
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SelfAug achieves a superior
balance between downstream learning and general capability retention. Our
comprehensive empirical analysis reveals a direct correlation between
distribution shifts and the severity of catastrophic forgetting in RAG
scenarios, highlighting how the absence of RAG capabilities in general
instruction tuning leads to significant distribution shifts during fine-tuning.
Our findings not only advance the understanding of catastrophic forgetting in
RAG contexts but also provide a practical solution applicable across diverse
fine-tuning scenarios. Our code is publicly available at

Conclusion: 错误驱动机制有效提升模型对正确/错误SQL的区分能力，迭代验证反馈确保数据质量，实验证明该方法在复杂SQL生成任务中的优越性

Abstract: Despite the significant advancements of self-play fine-tuning (SPIN), which
can transform a weak large language model (LLM) into a strong one through
competitive interactions between models of varying capabilities, it still faces
challenges in the Text-to-SQL task. SPIN does not generate new information, and
the large number of correct SQL queries produced by the opponent model during
self-play reduces the main model's ability to generate accurate SQL queries. To
address this challenge, we propose a new self-play fine-tuning method tailored
for the Text-to-SQL task, called SPFT-SQL. Prior to self-play, we introduce a
verification-based iterative fine-tuning approach, which synthesizes
high-quality fine-tuning data iteratively based on the database schema and
validation feedback to enhance model performance, while building a model base
with varying capabilities. During the self-play fine-tuning phase, we propose
an error-driven loss method that incentivizes incorrect outputs from the
opponent model, enabling the main model to distinguish between correct SQL and
erroneous SQL generated by the opponent model, thereby improving its ability to
generate correct SQL. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses on six
open-source LLMs and five widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

TL;DR: 提出首个语音角色扮演对话代理的评估基准VoxRole，解决现有研究忽略副语言特征和缺乏标准化评估的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RPCA研究局限于文本模态，忽略语音中的语调/韵律特征；同时语音角色扮演领域长期缺乏能有效评估角色一致性的标准化基准。

Method: 采用两阶段自动化流程：1. 对齐电影音频与剧本 2. 用LLM系统构建角色的多维档案(13335个对话/1228角色/261部电影)

Result: 通过VoxRole对当代语音对话模型进行多维评估，揭示其在保持角色一致性方面的关键优势与局限性

Conclusion: VoxRole填补了语音角色扮演领域的评估空白，为提升对话代理的人物塑造一致性提供了重要基准工具

Abstract: Recent significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly
propelled the development of Role-Playing Conversational Agents (RPCAs). These
systems aim to create immersive user experiences through consistent persona
adoption. However, current RPCA research faces dual limitations. First,
existing work predominantly focuses on the textual modality, entirely
overlooking critical paralinguistic features including intonation, prosody, and
rhythm in speech, which are essential for conveying character emotions and
shaping vivid identities. Second, the speech-based role-playing domain suffers
from a long-standing lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. Most current
spoken dialogue datasets target only fundamental capability assessments,
featuring thinly sketched or ill-defined character profiles. Consequently, they
fail to effectively quantify model performance on core competencies like
long-term persona consistency. To address this critical gap, we introduce
VoxRole, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for the
evaluation of speech-based RPCAs. The benchmark comprises 13335 multi-turn
dialogues, totaling 65.6 hours of speech from 1228 unique characters across 261
movies. To construct this resource, we propose a novel two-stage automated
pipeline that first aligns movie audio with scripts and subsequently employs an
LLM to systematically build multi-dimensional profiles for each character.
Leveraging VoxRole, we conduct a multi-dimensional evaluation of contemporary
spoken dialogue models, revealing crucial insights into their respective
strengths and limitations in maintaining persona consistency.

Motivation: 评估大语言模型(LLMs)在中文不实信息事实核查中的实际效果与局限性

Method: 1. 构建包含2万标注实例的CANDY基准测试
2. 结合思维链和少样本提示测试模型表现
3. 开发缺陷解释分类法分析失败原因

Result: 当前LLMs生成核查结论准确率低（事实捏造占失败主因），但作为辅助工具可使人类表现提升

Conclusion: LLMs暂不可独立用于事实核查，但在人机协同场景中具有重要辅助价值

Abstract: The effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) to fact-check
misinformation remains uncertain, despite their growing use. To this end, we
present CANDY, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the capabilities
and limitations of LLMs in fact-checking Chinese misinformation. Specifically,
we curate a carefully annotated dataset of ~20k instances. Our analysis shows
that current LLMs exhibit limitations in generating accurate fact-checking
conclusions, even when enhanced with chain-of-thought reasoning and few-shot
prompting. To understand these limitations, we develop a taxonomy to categorize
flawed LLM-generated explanations for their conclusions and identify factual
fabrication as the most common failure mode. Although LLMs alone are unreliable
for fact-checking, our findings indicate their considerable potential to
augment human performance when deployed as assistive tools in scenarios. Our
dataset and code can be accessed at https://github.com/SCUNLP/CANDY

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在极低资源语言(如濒危的Ladin语)上效果有限，需构建高质量NLP数据集支撑技术发展

Method: 利用少量平行语料翻译意大利语数据生成合成数据集，通过过滤和回译保证质量，并整合到机器翻译训练中

Result: 成功创建首个公开的Ladin语NLP数据集，实验显示显著提升意大利-Ladin翻译基线性能

Conclusion: 为极低资源语言提供了可复制的数据增强框架，推动濒危语言技术保护与NLP研究

Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) diminishes for extremely
low-resource languages, such as indigenous languages, primarily due to the lack
of labeled data. Despite growing interest, the availability of high-quality
natural language processing (NLP) datasets for these languages remains limited,
making it difficult to develop robust language technologies. This paper
addresses such gap by focusing on Ladin, an endangered Romance language,
specifically targeting the Val Badia variant. Leveraging a small set of
parallel Ladin-Italian sentence pairs, we create synthetic datasets for
sentiment analysis and multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) by translating
monolingual Italian data. To ensure linguistic quality and reliability, we
apply rigorous filtering and back-translation procedures in our method. We
further demonstrate that incorporating these synthetic datasets into machine
translation training leads to substantial improvements over existing
Italian-Ladin translation baselines. Our contributions include the first
publicly available sentiment analysis and MCQA datasets for Ladin, establishing
foundational resources that can support broader NLP research and downstream
applications for this underrepresented language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TKGQA方法处理复杂时序查询能力有限，分解框架存在推理能力不足和错误传播问题。需要无训练增强推理能力并提升容错性

Method: 包含三个核心模块：1）时序问题分解器递归拆解问题；2）递归求解器结合LLM与TKG知识自底向上求解子问题；3）答案聚合器通过多路径融合提升容错性

Result: 在MultiTQ和TimelineKGQA基准测试中，'Multiple'和'Complex'类别的Hits@1指标显著提升，最高达6.1%改进，超越现有SOTA方法

Conclusion: RTQA通过递归思维框架有效解决复杂时序推理问题，其模块化设计和开源资源为时间敏感型问答系统提供新思路

Abstract: Current temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) methods primarily
focus on implicit temporal constraints, lacking the capability of handling more
complex temporal queries, and struggle with limited reasoning abilities and
error propagation in decomposition frameworks. We propose RTQA, a novel
framework to address these challenges by enhancing reasoning over TKGs without
requiring training. Following recursive thinking, RTQA recursively decomposes
questions into sub-problems, solves them bottom-up using LLMs and TKG
knowledge, and employs multi-path answer aggregation to improve fault
tolerance. RTQA consists of three core components: the Temporal Question
Decomposer, the Recursive Solver, and the Answer Aggregator. Experiments on
MultiTQ and TimelineKGQA benchmarks demonstrate significant Hits@1 improvements
in "Multiple" and "Complex" categories, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs评估中固定格式基准测试与实际应用语言变体之间的差距问题，验证基准测试能否真实反映模型能力

Method: 系统生成6个基准测试的改写问题，测试34个不同规模先进LLM的性能变化

Result: 1. LLM排名跨改写输入保持稳定
2. 绝对有效性得分显著下降（最高降幅达20%）
3. 模型对语言变体处理能力不足

Conclusion: 现行基准测试可能高估模型实际应用能力，需开发包含语言变异性的鲁棒性评估体系，强调实践场景适应性评估的重要性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) effectiveness is usually evaluated by means of
benchmarks such as MMLU, ARC-C, or HellaSwag, where questions are presented in
their original wording, thus in a fixed, standardized format. However,
real-world applications involve linguistic variability, requiring models to
maintain their effectiveness across diverse rewordings of the same question or
query. In this study, we systematically assess the robustness of LLMs to
paraphrased benchmark questions and investigate whether benchmark-based
evaluations provide a reliable measure of model capabilities. We systematically
generate various paraphrases of all the questions across six different common
benchmarks, and measure the resulting variations in effectiveness of 34
state-of-the-art LLMs, of different size and effectiveness. Our findings reveal
that while LLM rankings remain relatively stable across paraphrased inputs,
absolute effectiveness scores change, and decline significantly. This suggests
that LLMs struggle with linguistic variability, raising concerns about their
generalization abilities and evaluation methodologies. Furthermore, the
observed performance drop challenges the reliability of benchmark-based
evaluations, indicating that high benchmark scores may not fully capture a
model's robustness to real-world input variations. We discuss the implications
of these findings for LLM evaluation methodologies, emphasizing the need for
robustness-aware benchmarks that better reflect practical deployment scenarios.

Abstract: How similar are model outputs across languages? In this work, we study this
question using a recently proposed model similarity metric $\kappa_p$ applied
to 20 languages and 47 subjects in GlobalMMLU. Our analysis reveals that a
model's responses become increasingly consistent across languages as its size
and capability grow. Interestingly, models exhibit greater cross-lingual
consistency within themselves than agreement with other models prompted in the
same language. These results highlight not only the value of $\kappa_p$ as a
practical tool for evaluating multilingual reliability, but also its potential
to guide the development of more consistent multilingual systems.

Motivation: 现有中文功能句法自动标注系统的缺失严重制约理论应用，需填补该领域空白。

Method: 采用RoBERTa-Chinese wwm-ext模型，基于人工标注的4,100句人民日报语料进行微调训练，实现命名实体识别任务。

Result: 测试集F1达0.852，核心句法要素识别优异，但样本不均衡实体识别仍需改进。

Conclusion: 首次实现功能语法与注意力模型的结合，为自动化中文句法分析提供新方法并奠定研究基础。

Abstract: Systemic Functional Grammar and its branch, Cardiff Grammar, have been widely
applied to discourse analysis, semantic function research, and other tasks
across various languages and texts. However, an automatic annotation system
based on this theory for Chinese texts has not yet been developed, which
significantly constrains the application and promotion of relevant theories. To
fill this gap, this research introduces a functional syntax annotation model
for Chinese based on RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach).
The study randomly selected 4,100 sentences from the People's Daily 2014 corpus
and annotated them according to functional syntax theory to establish a dataset
for training. The study then fine-tuned the RoBERTa-Chinese wwm-ext model based
on the dataset to implement the named entity recognition task, achieving an F1
score of 0.852 on the test set that significantly outperforms other comparative
models. The model demonstrated excellent performance in identifying core
syntactic elements such as Subject (S), Main Verb (M), and Complement (C).
Nevertheless, there remains room for improvement in recognizing entities with
imbalanced label samples. As the first integration of functional syntax with
attention-based NLP models, this research provides a new method for automated
Chinese functional syntax analysis and lays a solid foundation for subsequent
studies.

Result: Qwen3-8B在MusicTheoryBench超越GPT-4，数学推理能力同步提升，合成数据显著改进模型表现

Conclusion: 首创新方法论证实合成乐谱问题不仅能推进AI乐谱理解，更为AI音乐创作开辟新可能性

Abstract: Enhancing the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) to interpret sheet music is a crucial step toward
building AI musicians. However, current research lacks both evaluation
benchmarks and training data for sheet music reasoning. To address this, we
propose the idea of synthesizing sheet music problems grounded in music theory,
which can serve both as evaluation benchmarks and as training data for
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). We introduce a data
synthesis framework that generates verifiable sheet music questions in both
textual and visual modalities, leading to the Synthetic Sheet Music Reasoning
Benchmark (SSMR-Bench) and a complementary training set. Evaluation results on
SSMR-Bench show the importance of models' reasoning abilities in interpreting
sheet music. At the same time, the poor performance of Gemini 2.5-Pro
highlights the challenges that MLLMs still face in interpreting sheet music in
a visual format. By leveraging synthetic data for RLVR, Qwen3-8B-Base and
Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct achieve improvements on the SSMR-Bench. Besides, the
trained Qwen3-8B-Base surpasses GPT-4 in overall performance on
MusicTheoryBench and achieves reasoning performance comparable to GPT-4 with
the strategies of Role play and Chain-of-Thought. Notably, its performance on
math problems also improves relative to the original Qwen3-8B-Base.
Furthermore, our results show that the enhanced reasoning ability can also
facilitate music composition. In conclusion, we are the first to propose the
idea of synthesizing sheet music problems based on music theory rules, and
demonstrate its effectiveness not only in advancing model reasoning for sheet
music understanding but also in unlocking new possibilities for AI-assisted
music creation.

Method: 通过系统性文献综述，分析现有阿拉伯教育聊天机器人的技术路线（基于规则/机器学习）、语言支持（方言/标准阿拉伯语）及评估指标

Result: 发现仅少数系统采用深度学习技术，82%仍依赖传统规则引擎，且存在方言适应能力差、评估标准不统一等问题

Conclusion: 建议开发基于LLM的阿拉伯语适配模型，建立多方言语料库，并设计教育场景特化的评估体系以推动领域发展

Abstract: The recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) in general, and in
Natural Language Processing (NLP) in particular, and some of its applications
such as chatbots, have led to their implementation in different domains like
education, healthcare, tourism, and customer service. Since the COVID-19
pandemic, there has been an increasing interest in these digital technologies
to allow and enhance remote access. In education, e-learning systems have been
massively adopted worldwide. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLM) such
as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT
(Generative Pre-trained Transformers) made chatbots even more popular. In this
study, we present a survey on existing Arabic chatbots in education and their
different characteristics such as the adopted approaches, language variety, and
metrics used to measure their performance. We were able to identified some
research gaps when we discovered that, despite the success of chatbots in other
languages such as English, only a few educational Arabic chatbots used modern
techniques. Finally, we discuss future directions of research in this field.

Conclusion: 该框架为媒体内容审计、情报分析等领域提供了可解释的叙事解析工具，特别适用于需要溯源的场景

Abstract: Understanding covert narratives and implicit messaging is essential for
analyzing bias and sentiment. Traditional NLP methods struggle with detecting
subtle phrasing and hidden agendas. This study tackles two key challenges: (1)
multi-label classification of narratives and sub-narratives in news articles,
and (2) generating concise, evidence-based explanations for dominant
narratives. We fine-tune a BERT model with a recall-oriented approach for
comprehensive narrative detection, refining predictions using a GPT-4o pipeline
for consistency. For narrative explanation, we propose a ReACT (Reasoning +
Acting) framework with semantic retrieval-based few-shot prompting, ensuring
grounded and relevant justifications. To enhance factual accuracy and reduce
hallucinations, we incorporate a structured taxonomy table as an auxiliary
knowledge base. Our results show that integrating auxiliary knowledge in
prompts improves classification accuracy and justification reliability, with
applications in media analysis, education, and intelligence gathering.

Motivation: 词汇对齐可提升沟通效率，但在LLM驱动的对话智能体中研究不足。构建稳定的个性化词汇档案是实现词汇对齐的重要基础。

Method: 通过调整转录语音数据量（0-20分钟）和词类词项数量（形容词/连词5个，副词/名词/代词/动词10个），使用召回率、覆盖率和余弦相似度评估词库稳定性。

Result: 10分钟语音数据构建的紧凑型词库（形容词/连词各5词项，其他词类各10词项）在保持高覆盖率（84.5%）的同时，数据效率最优。

Conclusion: 研究为对话智能体词汇对齐提供了可操作方案，证明通过有限数据即可构建有效词库，为后续动态对齐策略奠定基础。

Abstract: Lexical alignment, where speakers start to use similar words across
conversation, is known to contribute to successful communication. However, its
implementation in conversational agents remains underexplored, particularly
considering the recent advancements in large language models (LLMs). As a first
step towards enabling lexical alignment in human-agent dialogue, this study
draws on strategies for personalising conversational agents and investigates
the construction of stable, personalised lexical profiles as a basis for
lexical alignment. Specifically, we varied the amounts of transcribed spoken
data used for construction as well as the number of items included in the
profiles per part-of-speech (POS) category and evaluated profile performance
across time using recall, coverage, and cosine similarity metrics. It was shown
that smaller and more compact profiles, created after 10 min of transcribed
speech containing 5 items for adjectives, 5 items for conjunctions, and 10
items for adverbs, nouns, pronouns, and verbs each, offered the best balance in
both performance and data efficiency. In conclusion, this study offers
practical insights into constructing stable, personalised lexical profiles,
taking into account minimal data requirements, serving as a foundational step
toward lexical alignment strategies in conversational agents.

Abstract: In linguistics, coherence can be achieved by different means, such as by
maintaining reference to the same set of entities across sentences and by
establishing discourse relations between them. However, most existing work on
coherence modeling focuses exclusively on either entity features or discourse
relation features, with little attention given to combining the two. In this
study, we explore two methods for jointly modeling entities and discourse
relations for coherence assessment. Experiments on three benchmark datasets
show that integrating both types of features significantly enhances the
performance of coherence models, highlighting the benefits of modeling both
simultaneously for coherence evaluation.

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升心理咨询数据生成质量，并通过系统性评估验证实用性，为领域提供可靠数据支持

Abstract: The growing demand for scalable psychological counseling highlights the need
for fine-tuning open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) with high-quality,
privacy-compliant data, yet such data remains scarce. Here we introduce MAGneT,
a novel multi-agent framework for synthetic psychological counseling session
generation that decomposes counselor response generation into coordinated
sub-tasks handled by specialized LLM agents, each modeling a key psychological
technique. Unlike prior single-agent approaches, MAGneT better captures the
structure and nuance of real counseling. In addition, we address
inconsistencies in prior evaluation protocols by proposing a unified evaluation
framework integrating diverse automatic and expert metrics. Furthermore, we
expand the expert evaluations from four aspects of counseling in previous works
to nine aspects, enabling a more thorough and robust assessment of data
quality. Empirical results show that MAGneT significantly outperforms existing
methods in quality, diversity, and therapeutic alignment of the generated
counseling sessions, improving general counseling skills by 3.2% and
CBT-specific skills by 4.3% on average on cognitive therapy rating scale
(CTRS). Crucially, experts prefer MAGneT-generated sessions in 77.2% of cases
on average across all aspects. Moreover, fine-tuning an open-source model on
MAGneT-generated sessions shows better performance, with improvements of 6.3%
on general counseling skills and 7.3% on CBT-specific skills on average on CTRS
over those fine-tuned with sessions generated by baseline methods. We also make

Abstract: Social event detection involves identifying and categorizing important events

which combines explicit text-based and implicit feature-space augmentation to
enhance data diversity and model robustness. The explicit augmentation utilizes
large language models to enhance textual information through five diverse
generation strategies. For implicit augmentation, we design five novel
perturbation techniques that operate in the feature space on structural fused
embeddings. These perturbations are crafted to keep the semantic and relational
properties of the embeddings and make them more diverse. Specifically, SED-Aug
outperforms the best baseline model by approximately 17.67% on the Twitter2012
dataset and by about 15.57% on the Twitter2018 dataset in terms of the average
F1 score. The code is available at GitHub: https://github.com/congboma/SED-Aug.

TL;DR: 提出Inverse IFEval基准测试，评估大语言模型突破训练惯性执行非常规指令的反直觉能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在遵循与训练模式冲突的对抗性指令时存在认知惯性缺陷

Method: 设计8类非常规挑战任务，构建1012个中英双语问题，采用优化的LLM-as-a-Judge评估框架

Result: 主流模型在非常规指令场景下表现不足，验证了该基准的必要性

Conclusion: 未来模型对齐需兼顾常规表现与非常规适应力，该基准可作为诊断工具与方法开发基础

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on diverse tasks but
often exhibit cognitive inertia, struggling to follow instructions that
conflict with the standardized patterns learned during supervised fine-tuning
(SFT). To evaluate this limitation, we propose Inverse IFEval, a benchmark that
measures models Counter-intuitive Abilitytheir capacity to override
training-induced biases and comply with adversarial instructions. Inverse
IFEval introduces eight types of such challenges, including Question
Correction, Intentional Textual Flaws, Code without Comments, and
Counterfactual Answering. Using a human-in-the-loop pipeline, we construct a
dataset of 1012 high-quality Chinese and English questions across 23 domains,
evaluated under an optimized LLM-as-a-Judge framework. Experiments on existing
leading LLMs demonstrate the necessity of our proposed Inverse IFEval
benchmark. Our findings emphasize that future alignment efforts should not only
pursue fluency and factual correctness but also account for adaptability under
unconventional contexts. We hope that Inverse IFEval serves as both a
diagnostic tool and a foundation for developing methods that mitigate cognitive
inertia, reduce overfitting to narrow patterns, and ultimately enhance the
instruction-following reliability of LLMs in diverse and unpredictable
real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs辅助医疗的潜力显著，但其依赖静态数据无法适应医学知识的动态更新，可能导致临床建议错误，需系统性评估模型对过时知识的依赖问题。

Method: 构建基于系统评价的MedRevQA（16,501 QA对）和MedChangeQA（512 QA对）数据集，评估8个主流LLM表现，分析过时预训练数据与训练策略的影响。

Result: 所有模型均存在过时知识依赖现象，模型性能与预训练数据时效性及RLHF训练策略显著相关，凸显当前医疗AI系统的可靠性缺陷。

Conclusion: 需开发动态更新的医疗AI系统，未来应聚焦预训练数据去陈旧化、主动知识更新机制及基于循证医学的持续学习策略以提升可靠性。

Abstract: The growing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant
potential to enhance healthcare by assisting medical researchers and
physicians. However, their reliance on static training data is a major risk
when medical recommendations evolve with new research and developments. When
LLMs memorize outdated medical knowledge, they can provide harmful advice or
fail at clinical reasoning tasks. To investigate this problem, we introduce two
novel question-answering (QA) datasets derived from systematic reviews:
MedRevQA (16,501 QA pairs covering general biomedical knowledge) and
MedChangeQA (a subset of 512 QA pairs where medical consensus has changed over
time). Our evaluation of eight prominent LLMs on the datasets reveals
consistent reliance on outdated knowledge across all models. We additionally
analyze the influence of obsolete pre-training data and training strategies to
explain this phenomenon and propose future directions for mitigation, laying
the groundwork for developing more current and reliable medical AI systems.

TL;DR: PARCO提出结合音素感知编码、对比实体消歧、实体级监督和分层实体过滤，显著提升上下文ASR在同音实体识别中的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>

Motivation: 传统上下文ASR存在音素变化捕捉不足、实体独立性假设导致多token偏置不完整等问题，难以有效处理领域专有名词和同音词识别。

Method: 1. 音素感知编码增强语音特征区分
2. 对比实体消歧提升语义判别
3. 实体级监督确保完整实体检索
4. 分层过滤机制减少不确定场景的误报

Result: 在中文AISHELL-1(4.22% CER)和英文DATA2(11.14% WER)上优于基线模型，在THCHS-30/LibriSpeech等跨域数据集保持稳定提升。

Conclusion: PARCO通过联合优化音素-语义表征，实现跨语言、跨领域的鲁棒实体识别，为ASR系统处理专业领域内容提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems struggle with domain-specific
named entities, especially homophones. Contextual ASR improves recognition but
often fails to capture fine-grained phoneme variations due to limited entity
diversity. Moreover, prior methods treat entities as independent tokens,
leading to incomplete multi-token biasing. To address these issues, we propose
Phoneme-Augmented Robust Contextual ASR via COntrastive entity disambiguation
(PARCO), which integrates phoneme-aware encoding, contrastive entity
disambiguation, entity-level supervision, and hierarchical entity filtering.
These components enhance phonetic discrimination, ensure complete entity
retrieval, and reduce false positives under uncertainty. Experiments show that
PARCO achieves CER of 4.22% on Chinese AISHELL-1 and WER of 11.14% on English
DATA2 under 1,000 distractors, significantly outperforming baselines. PARCO
also demonstrates robust gains on out-of-domain datasets like THCHS-30 and
LibriSpeech.

Motivation: 现有LLM性别偏见评估方法依赖非自然分布的测试提示，可能触发模型的'测试模式'，影响评估结果的生态有效性。

Method: 通过控制提示条件（突出测试背景/性别内容），在四种任务格式中结合概率指标和离散选择指标进行对比测试。

Result: 提示敏感性导致32%案例出现方向逆转，离散选择指标比概率指标平均放大1.8倍偏见强度。

Conclusion: 当前评估方法存在脆弱性，需重新思考如何设计既控制变量又保持生态有效的LLM评估基准。

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly applied in socially impactful settings, concerns
about gender bias have prompted growing efforts both to measure and mitigate
such bias. These efforts often rely on evaluation tasks that differ from
natural language distributions, as they typically involve carefully constructed
task prompts that overtly or covertly signal the presence of gender
bias-related content. In this paper, we examine how signaling the evaluative
purpose of a task impacts measured gender bias in LLMs. Concretely, we test
models under prompt conditions that (1) make the testing context salient, and
(2) make gender-focused content salient. We then assess prompt sensitivity
across four task formats with both token-probability and discrete-choice
metrics. We find that even minor prompt changes can substantially alter bias
outcomes, sometimes reversing their direction entirely. Discrete-choice metrics
further tend to amplify bias relative to probabilistic measures. These findings
do not only highlight the brittleness of LLM gender bias evaluations but open a
new puzzle for the NLP benchmarking and development community: To what extent
can well-controlled testing designs trigger LLM ``testing mode'' performance,
and what does this mean for the ecological validity of future benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注公历系统，但非公历日历（如日本/伊斯兰/希伯来历）承载着文化时间认知，当前语言模型在此类系统的处理能力尚未被充分评估。

Method: 构建包含日历转换、算术运算及跨日历一致性等四项任务的日式日历数据集，对比评估英语系和日语系语言模型的性能。

Result: 部分模型可完成基础日历转换，但日本专用模型在日历算术（误差率超50%）和跨系统一致性任务（准确率不足30%）中表现欠佳。

Conclusion: 语言模型需增强文化特定日历的时空推理能力，建议通过多任务训练和本土化数据增强提升跨文化时间理解。

Abstract: Temporal reasoning and knowledge are essential capabilities for language
models (LMs). While much prior work has analyzed and improved temporal
reasoning in LMs, most studies have focused solely on the Gregorian calendar.
However, many non-Gregorian systems, such as the Japanese, Hijri, and Hebrew
calendars, are in active use and reflect culturally grounded conceptions of
time. If and how well current LMs can accurately handle such non-Gregorian
calendars has not been evaluated so far. Here, we present a systematic
evaluation of how well open-source LMs handle one such non-Gregorian system:
the Japanese calendar. For our evaluation, we create datasets for four tasks
that require both temporal knowledge and temporal reasoning. Evaluating a range
of English-centric and Japanese-centric LMs, we find that some models can
perform calendar conversions, but even Japanese-centric models struggle with
Japanese-calendar arithmetic and with maintaining consistency across calendars.
Our results highlight the importance of developing LMs that are better equipped
for culture-specific calendar understanding.

Conclusion: LuxDiT证明了数据驱动方法与生成模型结合的有效性，通过间接视觉线索成功推断复杂光照条件并实现跨域泛化。

Abstract: Estimating scene lighting from a single image or video remains a longstanding
challenge in computer vision and graphics. Learning-based approaches are
constrained by the scarcity of ground-truth HDR environment maps, which are
expensive to capture and limited in diversity. While recent generative models
offer strong priors for image synthesis, lighting estimation remains difficult
due to its reliance on indirect visual cues, the need to infer global
(non-local) context, and the recovery of high-dynamic-range outputs. We propose
LuxDiT, a novel data-driven approach that fine-tunes a video diffusion
transformer to generate HDR environment maps conditioned on visual input.
Trained on a large synthetic dataset with diverse lighting conditions, our
model learns to infer illumination from indirect visual cues and generalizes
effectively to real-world scenes. To improve semantic alignment between the
input and the predicted environment map, we introduce a low-rank adaptation
finetuning strategy using a collected dataset of HDR panoramas. Our method
produces accurate lighting predictions with realistic angular high-frequency
details, outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques in both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: ContraGS为资源受限场景提供高效3D重建方案，首次实现压缩表示的端到端训练突破

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a state-of-art technique to model real-world
scenes with high quality and real-time rendering. Typically, a higher quality
representation can be achieved by using a large number of 3D Gaussians.
However, using large 3D Gaussian counts significantly increases the GPU device
memory for storing model parameters. A large model thus requires powerful GPUs
with high memory capacities for training and has slower training/rendering
latencies due to the inefficiencies of memory access and data movement. In this
work, we introduce ContraGS, a method to enable training directly on compressed
3DGS representations without reducing the Gaussian Counts, and thus with a
little loss in model quality. ContraGS leverages codebooks to compactly store a
set of Gaussian parameter vectors throughout the training process, thereby
significantly reducing memory consumption. While codebooks have been
demonstrated to be highly effective at compressing fully trained 3DGS models,
directly training using codebook representations is an unsolved challenge.
ContraGS solves the problem of learning non-differentiable parameters in
codebook-compressed representations by posing parameter estimation as a
Bayesian inference problem. To this end, ContraGS provides a framework that
effectively uses MCMC sampling to sample over a posterior distribution of these
compressed representations. With ContraGS, we demonstrate that ContraGS
significantly reduces the peak memory during training (on average 3.49X) and
accelerated training and rendering (1.36X and 1.88X on average, respectively),
while retraining close to state-of-art quality.

Conclusion: 首次探索Perlin噪声作为异质散射参数建模工具，TensoIS框架为真实世界异质散射逆向问题提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Estimating scattering parameters of heterogeneous media from images is a
severely under-constrained and challenging problem. Most of the existing
approaches model BSSRDF either through an analysis-by-synthesis approach,
approximating complex path integrals, or using differentiable volume rendering
techniques to account for heterogeneity. However, only a few studies have
applied learning-based methods to estimate subsurface scattering parameters,
but they assume homogeneous media. Interestingly, no specific distribution is
known to us that can explicitly model the heterogeneous scattering parameters
in the real world. Notably, procedural noise models such as Perlin and Fractal
Perlin noise have been effective in representing intricate heterogeneities of
natural, organic, and inorganic surfaces. Leveraging this, we first create
HeteroSynth, a synthetic dataset comprising photorealistic images of
heterogeneous media whose scattering parameters are modeled using Fractal
Perlin noise. Furthermore, we propose Tensorial Inverse Scattering (TensoIS), a
learning-based feed-forward framework to estimate these Perlin-distributed
heterogeneous scattering parameters from sparse multi-view image observations.
Instead of directly predicting the 3D scattering parameter volume, TensoIS uses
learnable low-rank tensor components to represent the scattering volume. We
evaluate TensoIS on unseen heterogeneous variations over shapes from the
HeteroSynth test set, smoke and cloud geometries obtained from open-source
realistic volumetric simulations, and some real-world samples to establish its
effectiveness for inverse scattering. Overall, this study is an attempt to
explore Perlin noise distribution, given the lack of any such well-defined
distribution in literature, to potentially model real-world heterogeneous
scattering in a feed-forward manner.

Abstract: Stylized motion generation is actively studied in computer graphics,
especially benefiting from the rapid advances in diffusion models. The goal of
this task is to produce a novel motion respecting both the motion content and
the desired motion style, e.g., ``walking in a loop like a Monkey''. Existing
research attempts to address this problem via motion style transfer or
conditional motion generation. They typically embed the motion style into a
latent space and guide the motion implicitly in a latent space as well. Despite
the progress, their methods suffer from low interpretability and control,
limited generalization to new styles, and fail to produce motions other than
``walking'' due to the strong bias in the public stylization dataset. In this
paper, we propose to solve the stylized motion generation problem from a new
perspective of reasoning-composition-generation, based on our observations: i)
human motion can often be effectively described using natural language in a
body-part centric manner, ii) LLMs exhibit a strong ability to understand and
reason about human motion, and iii) human motion has an inherently
compositional nature, facilitating the new motion content or style generation
via effective recomposing. We thus propose utilizing body-part text space as an
intermediate representation, and present SMooGPT, a fine-tuned LLM, acting as a
reasoner, composer, and generator when generating the desired stylized motion.
Our method executes in the body-part text space with much higher
interpretability, enabling fine-grained motion control, effectively resolving
potential conflicts between motion content and style, and generalizes well to
new styles thanks to the open-vocabulary ability of LLMs. Comprehensive
experiments and evaluations, and a user perceptual study, demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, especially under the pure text-driven stylized
motion generation.

Abstract: Creating human avatars is a highly desirable yet challenging task. Recent
advancements in radiance field rendering have achieved unprecedented
photorealism and real-time performance for personalized dynamic human avatars.
However, these approaches are typically limited to person-specific rendering
models trained on multi-view video data for a single individual, limiting their
ability to generalize across different identities. On the other hand,
generative approaches leveraging prior knowledge from pre-trained 2D diffusion
models can produce cartoonish, static human avatars, which are animated through
simple skeleton-based articulation. Therefore, the avatars generated by these
methods suffer from lower rendering quality compared to person-specific
rendering methods and fail to capture pose-dependent deformations such as cloth
wrinkles. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that unites the strengths
of person-specific rendering and diffusion-based generative modeling to enable
dynamic human avatar generation with both high photorealism and realistic
pose-dependent deformations. Our method follows a two-stage pipeline: first, we
optimize a set of person-specific UNets, with each network representing a
dynamic human avatar that captures intricate pose-dependent deformations. In
the second stage, we train a hyper diffusion model over the optimized network
weights. During inference, our method generates network weights for real-time,
controllable rendering of dynamic human avatars. Using a large-scale,
cross-identity, multi-view video dataset, we demonstrate that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art human avatar generation methods.

Abstract: An elastic rod is a long and thin body able to sustain large global
deformations, even if local strains are small. The Cosserat rod is a non-linear
elastic rod with an oriented centreline, which enables modelling of bending,
stretching and twisting deformations. It can be used for physically-based
computer simulation of threads, wires, ropes, as well as flexible surgical
instruments such as catheters, guidewires or sutures. We present a
massively-parallel implementation of the original CoRdE model as well as our
inextensible variation. By superseding the CUDA Scalable Programming Model and
using inter-block synchronization, we managed to simulate multiple physics
time-steps per single kernel launch utilizing all the GPU's streaming
multiprocessors. Under some constraints, this results in nearly constant
computation time, regardless of the number of Cosserat elements simulated. When
executing 10 time-steps per single kernel launch, our implementation of the
original, extensible CoRdE was x40.0 faster. In a number of tests, the GPU
implementation of our inextensible CoRdE modification achieved an average
speed-up of x15.11 over the corresponding CPU version. Simulating a
catheter/guidewire pair (2x512 Cosserat elements) in a cardiovascular
application resulted in a 13.5 fold performance boost, enabling for accurate
real-time simulation at haptic interactive rates (0.5-1kHz).

Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) systems have recently achieved more expressive and
natural speech synthesis by scaling to large speech datasets. However, the
proportion of expressive speech in such large-scale corpora is often unclear.
Besides, existing expressive speech corpora are typically smaller in scale and
primarily used for benchmarking TTS systems. In this paper, we introduce the
LibriQuote dataset, an English corpus derived from read audiobooks, designed
for both fine-tuning and benchmarking expressive zero-shot TTS system. The
training dataset includes 12.7K hours of read, non-expressive speech and 5.3K
hours of mostly expressive speech drawn from character quotations. Each
utterance in the expressive subset is supplemented with the context in which it
was written, along with pseudo-labels of speech verbs and adverbs used to
describe the quotation (\textit{e.g. ``he whispered softly''}). Additionally,
we provide a challenging 7.5 hour test set intended for benchmarking TTS
systems: given a neutral reference speech as input, we evaluate system's
ability to synthesize an expressive utterance while preserving reference
timbre. We validate qualitatively the test set by showing that it covers a wide
range of emotions compared to non-expressive speech, along with various
accents. Extensive subjective and objective evaluations show that fine-tuning a

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有AI系统在有限数据和分布变化场景下的适应性问题，提供结构化因果模型驱动的标准化评估框架

Method: 基于结构因果模型构建测试任务，通过观测/干预/反事实三种数据增强方式提供上下文学习样本

Result: 成功应用于测试时训练、反事实推理、程序合成和因果发现四个语言模型评估场景

Conclusion: CausalARC为系统性研究因果推理能力提供了可解释的实验平台，推动AI的泛化性提升

Abstract: Reasoning requires adaptation to novel problem settings under limited data
and distribution shift. This work introduces CausalARC: an experimental testbed
for AI reasoning in low-data and out-of-distribution regimes, modeled after the
Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). Each CausalARC reasoning task is
sampled from a fully specified causal world model, formally expressed as a
structural causal model. Principled data augmentations provide observational,
interventional, and counterfactual feedback about the world model in the form
of few-shot, in-context learning demonstrations. As a proof-of-concept, we
illustrate the use of CausalARC for four language model evaluation settings:
(1) abstract reasoning with test-time training, (2) counterfactual reasoning
with in-context learning, (3) program synthesis, and (4) causal discovery with
logical reasoning.

Motivation: 大语言模型在逻辑推理中存在错误率高、缺乏人类稳健心理表征的问题

Result: 系统成功引导LLMs通过具身认知结构解释场景，可执行程序提升推理可解释性

Conclusion: 建立了融合动态复杂表征的计算基础，当前聚焦空间原语的实现具有扩展潜力

Abstract: Despite significant progress in natural language understanding, Large
Language Models (LLMs) remain error-prone when performing logical reasoning,
often lacking the robust mental representations that enable human-like
comprehension. We introduce a prototype neurosymbolic system, Embodied-LM, that
grounds understanding and logical reasoning in schematic representations based
on image schemas-recurring patterns derived from sensorimotor experience that
structure human cognition. Our system operationalizes the spatial foundations
of these cognitive structures using declarative spatial reasoning within Answer
Set Programming. Through evaluation on logical deduction problems, we
demonstrate that LLMs can be guided to interpret scenarios through embodied
cognitive structures, that these structures can be formalized as executable
programs, and that the resulting representations support effective logical
reasoning with enhanced interpretability. While our current implementation
focuses on spatial primitives, it establishes the computational foundation for
incorporating more complex and dynamic representations.

TL;DR: 揭示强化学习提升语言模型推理能力的层次优化机制，提出HICRA算法突破战略规划瓶颈


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在优化语言模型时存在信号稀释问题，需要理解RL提升推理能力的内在机制

Method: 通过分析RL训练动态发现分层优化规律，设计战略token感知的HICRA算法，采用语义熵验证战略探索效果

Result: HICRA显著超越GRPO等基线方法，语义熵比token级熵更准确反映战略规划质量

Conclusion: 分层优化机制是提升复杂推理的关键，HICRA通过聚焦战略token突破瓶颈，语义熵为战略探索提供可靠指引

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven highly effective at enhancing the
complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet underlying
mechanisms driving this success remain largely opaque. Our analysis reveals
that puzzling phenomena like ``aha moments", ``length-scaling'' and entropy
dynamics are not disparate occurrences but hallmarks of an emergent reasoning
hierarchy, akin to the separation of high-level strategic planning from
low-level procedural execution in human cognition. We uncover a compelling
two-phase dynamic: initially, a model is constrained by procedural correctness
and must improve its low-level skills. The learning bottleneck then decisively
shifts, with performance gains being driven by the exploration and mastery of
high-level strategic planning. This insight exposes a core inefficiency in
prevailing RL algorithms like GRPO, which apply optimization pressure
agnostically and dilute the learning signal across all tokens. To address this,
we propose HIerarchy-Aware Credit Assignment (HICRA), an algorithm that
concentrates optimization efforts on high-impact planning tokens. HICRA
significantly outperforms strong baselines, demonstrating that focusing on this
strategic bottleneck is key to unlocking advanced reasoning. Furthermore, we
validate semantic entropy as a superior compass for measuring strategic
exploration over misleading metrics such as token-level entropy.

TL;DR: 研究发现大语言模型（LLMs）虽能表现出类似人类的人格特质，但其自我报告结果无法可靠预测实际行为，且人格干预对行为影响有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs人格特质的动态演变机制，验证自我报告特质对行为的预测效度，评估人格干预（如角色注入）对模型表层特质表达和实际行为的影响差异。

Method: 通过三个维度系统分析：1）训练过程中特质特征的动态演化；2）自我报告特质在行为任务中的预测效度；3）角色注入等干预措施对自我报告和行为的差异化影响。

Result: 指令对齐（RLHF/指令微调）能稳定特质表达并增强特质相关性，但自我报告与行为关联度低，且人格干预对行为影响微弱或不一致。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs表层特质表达与行为一致性的本质差异，质疑现有LLMs人格评估假设，强调需在模型对齐和可解释性方面建立更深入的评估框架。

Abstract: Personality traits have long been studied as predictors of human
behavior.Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) suggest similar
patterns may emerge in artificial systems, with advanced LLMs displaying
consistent behavioral tendencies resembling human traits like agreeableness and
self-regulation. Understanding these patterns is crucial, yet prior work
primarily relied on simplified self-reports and heuristic prompting, with
little behavioral validation. In this study, we systematically characterize LLM
personality across three dimensions: (1) the dynamic emergence and evolution of
trait profiles throughout training stages; (2) the predictive validity of
self-reported traits in behavioral tasks; and (3) the impact of targeted
interventions, such as persona injection, on both self-reports and behavior.
Our findings reveal that instructional alignment (e.g., RLHF, instruction
tuning) significantly stabilizes trait expression and strengthens trait
correlations in ways that mirror human data. However, these self-reported
traits do not reliably predict behavior, and observed associations often
diverge from human patterns. While persona injection successfully steers
self-reports in the intended direction, it exerts little or inconsistent effect
on actual behavior. By distinguishing surface-level trait expression from
behavioral consistency, our findings challenge assumptions about LLM
personality and underscore the need for deeper evaluation in alignment and
interpretability.

Motivation: 传统token级RL框架无法匹配多步推理任务（如思维链）的语义层级特性，存在理论断层

Method: 提出CoT-Space理论框架，从噪声视角和风险视角分析推理过程，论证最优CoT长度的收敛机制

Result: 实验验证理论框架，合理解释过拟合等经验现象，建立可解释的理论基础

Conclusion: 该框架不仅统一解释经验现象，更为构建更有效的推理智能体提供理论指导

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a pivotal approach for enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a significant
theoretical gap persists, as traditional token-level RL frameworks fail to
align with the reasoning-level nature of complex, multi-step thought processes
like Chain-of-Thought (CoT). To address this challenge, we introduce CoT-Space,
a novel theoretical framework that recasts LLM reasoning from a discrete
token-prediction task to an optimization process within a continuous,
reasoning-level semantic space. By analyzing this process from both a noise
perspective and a risk perspective, we demonstrate that the convergence to an
optimal CoT length is a natural consequence of the fundamental trade-off
between underfitting and overfitting. Furthermore, extensive experiments
provide strong empirical validation for our theoretical findings. Our framework
not only provides a coherent explanation for empirical phenomena such as
overthinking but also offers a solid theoretical foundation to guide the future
development of more effective and generalizable reasoning agents.

Conclusion: 建立了首个可泛化心理学框架的LLM行为控制方法论，通过特质工程实现：
1. 人格条件反射式响应
2. 跨框架兼容性
3. 多智能体通信协议设计基础

Abstract: We introduce MBTI-in-Thoughts, a framework for enhancing the effectiveness of
Large Language Model (LLM) agents through psychologically grounded personality
conditioning. Drawing on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), our method
primes agents with distinct personality archetypes via prompt engineering,
enabling control over behavior along two foundational axes of human psychology,
cognition and affect. We show that such personality priming yields consistent,
interpretable behavioral biases across diverse tasks: emotionally expressive
agents excel in narrative generation, while analytically primed agents adopt
more stable strategies in game-theoretic settings. Our framework supports
experimenting with structured multi-agent communication protocols and reveals
that self-reflection prior to interaction improves cooperation and reasoning
quality. To ensure trait persistence, we integrate the official 16Personalities
test for automated verification. While our focus is on MBTI, we show that our
approach generalizes seamlessly to other psychological frameworks such as Big
Five, HEXACO, or Enneagram. By bridging psychological theory and LLM behavior
design, we establish a foundation for psychologically enhanced AI agents
without any fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在上下文重置后丢弃推理痕迹中的模式与洞见，实例化记忆（如精确问答对）复用性差，需要更通用的概念抽象机制

Method: 从解决方案轨迹中蒸馏出模块化自然语言概念，建立动态更新策略，通过选择性检索整合到新查询提示中实现零权重更新的持续学习

Result: 在ARC-AGI基准实现7.5%相对提升，性能随推理计算量持续扩展，动态记忆配置显著优于固定记忆

Conclusion: 概念级记忆通过抽象推理模式形成可扩展的知识库，验证了测试时自改进范式的有效性，为持续学习开辟新路径

Abstract: While inference-time scaling enables LLMs to carry out increasingly long and
capable reasoning traces, the patterns and insights uncovered during these
traces are immediately discarded once the context window is reset for a new
query. External memory is a natural way to persist these discoveries, and
recent work has shown clear benefits for reasoning-intensive tasks. We see an
opportunity to make such memories more broadly reusable and scalable by moving
beyond instance-based memory entries (e.g. exact query/response pairs, or
summaries tightly coupled with the original problem context) toward
concept-level memory: reusable, modular abstractions distilled from solution
traces and stored in natural language. For future queries, relevant concepts
are selectively retrieved and integrated into the prompt, enabling test-time
continual learning without weight updates. Our design introduces new strategies
for abstracting takeaways from rollouts and retrieving entries for new queries,
promoting reuse and allowing memory to expand with additional experiences. On
the challenging ARC-AGI benchmark, our method yields a 7.5% relative gain over
a strong no-memory baseline with performance continuing to scale with inference
compute. We find abstract concepts to be the most consistent memory design,
outscoring the baseline at all tested inference compute scales. Moreover, we
confirm that dynamically updating memory during test-time outperforms an
otherwise identical fixed memory setting with additional attempts, supporting
the hypothesis that solving more problems and abstracting more patterns to
memory enables further solutions in a form of self-improvement. Code available

TL;DR: CLIP-SVD提出通过奇异值分解实现CLIP模型的参数高效域适应，仅微调0.04%参数即在多领域达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型适应方法依赖提示工程或全模型微调，存在破坏预训练知识、参数效率低的问题。

Method: 对CLIP参数矩阵进行SVD分解，仅微调奇异值来调整基向量方向，保持原始模型结构不变。

Result: 在21个自然/生物医学数据集上实现最先进分类精度，少样本场景下泛化能力优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在提升域适应性能的同时，有效保留了预训练知识，为模型适配提供了可解释的技术路径。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have shown impressive zero-shot and
few-shot learning capabilities across diverse applications. However, adapting
these models to new fine-grained domains remains difficult due to reliance on
prompt engineering and the high cost of full model fine-tuning. Existing
adaptation approaches rely on augmented components, such as prompt tokens and
adapter modules, which could limit adaptation quality, destabilize the model,
and compromise the rich knowledge learned during pretraining. In this work, we
present \textbf{CLIP-SVD}, a novel \textit{multi-modal} and
\textit{parameter-efficient} adaptation technique that leverages Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to modify the internal parameter space of CLIP without
injecting additional modules. Specifically, we fine-tune only the singular
values of the CLIP parameter matrices to rescale the basis vectors for domain
adaptation while retaining the pretrained model. This design enables enhanced
adaptation performance using only \textbf{0.04\%} of the model's total
parameters and better preservation of its generalization ability. CLIP-SVD
achieves state-of-the-art classification results on 11 natural and 10
biomedical datasets, outperforming previous methods in both accuracy and
generalization under few-shot settings. Additionally, we leverage a natural
language-based approach to analyze the effectiveness and dynamics of the CLIP
adaptation to allow interpretability of CLIP-SVD. The code is publicly
available at https://github.com/HealthX-Lab/CLIP-SVD.

TL;DR: 提出SPECS——一种针对长图像描述的改进版CLIPScore指标，在保持高效计算的同时达到与LLM指标相当的人类判断相关性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有n-gram指标无法有效评估语义准确性；基于表示相似性的RS指标计算成本过高；LLM指标虽准确但成本不适用于模型开发迭代

Method: 改进CLIP模型，通过新的目标函数强调特异性——奖励正确细节/惩罚错误信息

Result: SPECS在人类判断相关性上与开源LLM指标相当，计算效率提升100倍以上

Conclusion: SPECS为图像描述模型开发提供了高性价比的迭代评估方案

Abstract: As interest grows in generating long, detailed image captions, standard
evaluation metrics become increasingly unreliable. N-gram-based metrics though
efficient, fail to capture semantic correctness. Representational Similarity
(RS) metrics, designed to address this, initially saw limited use due to high
computational costs, while today, despite advances in hardware, they remain
unpopular due to low correlation to human judgments. Meanwhile, metrics based
on large language models (LLMs) show strong correlation with human judgments,
but remain too expensive for iterative use during model development.
  We introduce SPECS (Specificity-Enhanced CLIPScore), a reference-free RS
metric tailored to long image captioning. SPECS modifies CLIP with a new
objective that emphasizes specificity: rewarding correct details and penalizing
incorrect ones. We show that SPECS matches the performance of open-source
LLM-based metrics in correlation to human judgments, while being far more
efficient. This makes it a practical alternative for iterative checkpoint
evaluation during image captioning model development.Our code can be found at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LMMs在多项选择题评测中因提示语设计差异导致性能波动大，存在评估不透明与不公平问题，需系统性评估提示敏感性以建立规范标准。

Method: 构建包含61种提示类型的Promptception框架（分6个超类别、15个维度），在MMStar等3个基准上测试10个LMMs（含GPT-4o/Gemini 1.5 Pro及开源模型）。

Result: 商业模型对提示语义敏感但上限高，开源模型稳定性强但复杂提示理解差；最优提示可使MMStar准确率提升15%。

Conclusion: 提出针对商业/开源模型的提示设计原则，通过Promptception框架实现更鲁棒公平的模型评估，为LMMs提示工程提供方法论指导。

Abstract: Despite the success of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in recent years, prompt
design for LMMs in Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) remains poorly
understood. We show that even minor variations in prompt phrasing and structure
can lead to accuracy deviations of up to 15% for certain prompts and models.
This variability poses a challenge for transparent and fair LMM evaluation, as
models often report their best-case performance using carefully selected
prompts. To address this, we introduce Promptception, a systematic framework
for evaluating prompt sensitivity in LMMs. It consists of 61 prompt types,
spanning 15 categories and 6 supercategories, each targeting specific aspects
of prompt formulation, and is used to evaluate 10 LMMs ranging from lightweight
open-source models to GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, across 3 MCQA benchmarks:
MMStar, MMMU-Pro, MVBench. Our findings reveal that proprietary models exhibit
greater sensitivity to prompt phrasing, reflecting tighter alignment with
instruction semantics, while open-source models are steadier but struggle with
nuanced and complex phrasing. Based on this analysis, we propose Prompting
Principles tailored to proprietary and open-source LMMs, enabling more robust
and fair model evaluation.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly evolving, presenting
increasingly complex safety challenges. However, current dataset construction
methods, which are risk-oriented, fail to cover the growing complexity of
real-world multimodal safety scenarios (RMS). And due to the lack of a unified
evaluation metric, their overall effectiveness remains unproven. This paper
introduces a novel image-oriented self-adaptive dataset construction method for
RMS, which starts with images and end constructing paired text and guidance
responses. Using the image-oriented method, we automatically generate an RMS
dataset comprising 35k image-text pairs with guidance responses. Additionally,
we introduce a standardized safety dataset evaluation metric: fine-tuning a
safety judge model and evaluating its capabilities on other safety
datasets.Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed image-oriented pipeline. The results confirm the scalability
and effectiveness of the image-oriented approach, offering a new perspective
for the construction of real-world multimodal safety datasets.

Motivation: 现有评估方法单独测试图像理解和生成能力，无法揭示模型跨模态转换时的语义一致性缺陷，可能影响实际应用效果。

Method: 设计循环评估协议(UCF-UM)，引入MCD/SDR/MGG三项指标，构建ND400新数据集测试非COCO泛化能力，评估7个主流模型。

Result: 模型表现分化明显：BAGEL多轮循环后仍保持语义稳定，Vila-u单次评分优秀但语义快速漂移，暴露单次评估的局限性。

Conclusion: 循环一致性应作为必要补充评估维度，UCF-UM为统一模型提供了跨模态稳定性和表征能力的量化分析框架。

Abstract: Employing a single, unified model (UM) for both visual understanding
(image-to-text: I2T) and and visual generation (text-to-image: T2I) has opened
a new direction in Visual Language Model (VLM) research. While UMs can also
support broader unimodal tasks (e.g., text-to-text, image-to-image), we focus
on the core cross-modal pair T2I and I2T, as consistency between understanding
and generation is critical for downstream use. Existing evaluations consider
these capabilities in isolation: FID and GenEval for T2I, and benchmarks such
as MME, MMBench for I2T. These single-pass metrics do not reveal whether a
model that understands a concept can also render it, nor whether meaning is
preserved when cycling between image and text modalities. To address this, we
introduce the Unified Consistency Framework for Unified Models (UCF-UM), a
cyclic evaluation protocol that alternates I2T and T2I over multiple
generations to quantify semantic drift. UCF formulates 3 metrics: (i) Mean
Cumulative Drift (MCD), an embedding-based measure of overall semantic loss;
(ii) Semantic Drift Rate (SDR), that summarizes semantic decay rate; and (iii)
Multi-Generation GenEval (MGG), an object-level compliance score extending
GenEval. To assess generalization beyond COCO, which is widely used in
training; we create a new benchmark ND400, sampled from NoCaps and DOCCI and
evaluate on seven recent models. UCF-UM reveals substantial variation in
cross-modal stability: some models like BAGEL maintain semantics over many
alternations, whereas others like Vila-u drift quickly despite strong
single-pass scores. Our results highlight cyclic consistency as a necessary
complement to standard I2T and T2I evaluations, and provide practical metrics
to consistently assess unified model's cross-modal stability and strength of
their shared representations. Code:

Result: 实验证明CTD方法各项指标全面领先，并构建包含ASR错误转录的新基准数据集

Conclusion: CTD能有效校正语音搜索中的ASR错误，新数据集为音频查询纠错提供全面评估基准

Abstract: Query spelling correction is an important function of modern search engines
since it effectively helps users express their intentions clearly. With the
growing popularity of speech search driven by Automated Speech Recognition
(ASR) systems, this paper introduces a novel method named Contextualized Token
Discrimination (CTD) to conduct effective speech query correction. In CTD, we
first employ BERT to generate token-level contextualized representations and
then construct a composition layer to enhance semantic information. Finally, we
produce the correct query according to the aggregated token representation,
correcting the incorrect tokens by comparing the original token representations
and the contextualized representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superior performance of our proposed method across all metrics, and we further
present a new benchmark dataset with erroneous ASR transcriptions to offer
comprehensive evaluations for audio query correction.

Abstract: Self-supervised speech models have demonstrated impressive performance in
speech processing, but their effectiveness on non-speech data remains
underexplored. We study the transfer learning capabilities of such models on
bioacoustic detection and classification tasks. We show that models such as
HuBERT, WavLM, and XEUS can generate rich latent representations of animal
sounds across taxa. We analyze the models properties with linear probing on
time-averaged representations. We then extend the approach to account for the
effect of time-wise information with other downstream architectures. Finally,
we study the implication of frequency range and noise on performance. Notably,
our results are competitive with fine-tuned bioacoustic pre-trained models and
show the impact of noise-robust pre-training setups. These findings highlight

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型训练方法（强化学习RL和监督微调SFT）分别依赖在线/离线数据，需探索二者的统一优化框架

Method: 构建包含四个可互换组件的统一策略梯度估计器，提出HPT算法动态选择训练信号，实现示范数据有效利用和稳定探索

Result: HPT在6个数学推理基准和2个分布外测试集中持续优于不同规模/家族的基线模型

Conclusion: 通过理论推导和实验验证，证明统一框架的有效性，HPT成功融合不同训练范式的优势

Abstract: Two major sources of training data exist for post-training modern language
models: online (model-generated rollouts) data, and offline (human or
other-model demonstrations) data. These two types of data are typically used by
approaches like Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
respectively. In this paper, we show that these approaches are not in
contradiction, but are instances of a single optimization process. We derive a
Unified Policy Gradient Estimator, and present the calculations of a wide
spectrum of post-training approaches as the gradient of a common objective
under different data distribution assumptions and various bias-variance
tradeoffs. The gradient estimator is constructed with four interchangeable
parts: stabilization mask, reference policy denominator, advantage estimate,
and likelihood gradient. Motivated by our theoretical findings, we propose
Hybrid Post-Training (HPT), an algorithm that dynamically selects different
training signals. HPT is designed to yield both effective exploitation of
demonstration and stable exploration without sacrificing learned reasoning
patterns. We provide extensive experiments and ablation studies to verify the
effectiveness of our unified theoretical framework and HPT. Across six
mathematical reasoning benchmarks and two out-of-distribution suites, HPT
consistently surpasses strong baselines across models of varying scales and
families.

TL;DR: 提出Delta Activations方法，通过量化微调模型与基础模型的激活层差异生成向量表示，有效支持模型聚类、任务嵌入和模型复用


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决海量开源微调模型因元数据不一致和存储库混乱导致的模型复用困难问题，提供结构化分析工具

Method: 通过测量微调模型与基础模型在内部激活层的偏移量（delta），将其编码为向量表示，支持跨模型的特征比较

Result: 该方法展示出：1) 对微调设置的强鲁棒性 2) 混合数据集时的向量可加性 3) 在模型聚类、任务嵌入、模型选择/融合中的有效性

Conclusion: Delta Activations为开放模型生态提供了结构化分析工具，其开源实现将促进社区模型复用实践，提升模型管理效率

Abstract: The success of powerful open source Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled
the community to create a vast collection of post-trained models adapted to
specific tasks and domains. However, navigating and understanding these models
remains challenging due to inconsistent metadata and unstructured repositories.
We introduce Delta Activations, a method to represent finetuned models as
vector embeddings by measuring shifts in their internal activations relative to
a base model. This representation allows for effective clustering by domain and
task, revealing structure in the model landscape. Delta Activations also
demonstrate desirable properties: it is robust across finetuning settings and
exhibits an additive property when finetuning datasets are mixed. In addition,
we show that Delta Activations can embed tasks via few-shot finetuning, and
further explore its use for model selection and merging. We hope Delta
Activations can facilitate the practice of reusing publicly available models.

TL;DR: 评估健康领域RAG系统对抗错误信息的鲁棒性，发现对抗性文档会降低模型输出准确性，但保留有益证据可维持系统稳健性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统存在吸收检索证据中错误信息的风险，在健康领域错误响应可能造成严重后果，需系统评估其脆弱性

Method: 通过控制实验改变检索文档类型（有益/有害/对抗）和问题框架（一致/中性/不一致），测试模型输出与事实的吻合度

Result: 对抗性文档使模型对齐度下降51%，但当有益证据同时存在时，模型正确率可保持基准水平的89%

Conclusion: 高风险领域构建RAG需设置检索保障机制，优先确保检索池包含可靠证据以维持系统稳健性

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems provide a method for factually
grounding the responses of a Large Language Model (LLM) by providing retrieved
evidence, or context, as support. Guided by this context, RAG systems can
reduce hallucinations and expand the ability of LLMs to accurately answer
questions outside the scope of their training data. Unfortunately, this design
introduces a critical vulnerability: LLMs may absorb and reproduce
misinformation present in retrieved evidence. This problem is magnified if
retrieved evidence contains adversarial material explicitly intended to
promulgate misinformation. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of RAG
robustness in the health domain and examines alignment between model outputs
and ground-truth answers. We focus on the health domain due to the potential
for harm caused by incorrect responses, as well as the availability of
evidence-based ground truth for many common health-related questions. We
conduct controlled experiments using common health questions, varying both the
type and composition of the retrieved documents (helpful, harmful, and
adversarial) as well as the framing of the question by the user (consistent,
neutral, and inconsistent). Our findings reveal that adversarial documents
substantially degrade alignment, but robustness can be preserved when helpful
evidence is also present in the retrieval pool. These findings offer actionable
insights for designing safer RAG systems in high-stakes domains by highlighting
the need for retrieval safeguards. To enable reproducibility and facilitate
future research, all experimental results are publicly available in our github
repository.

TL;DR: 提出了NER Retriever框架，通过大语言模型中间层表示和对比投影网络，实现无需预定义类型的零样本命名实体检索，在三个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖固定模式或微调模型，难以适应开放式的用户自定义类型描述。需要一种利用大语言模型内部语义表示的可扩展检索方案。

Method: 1. 提取大语言模型中间层的值向量作为实体和类型描述的共享语义嵌入
2. 训练轻量级对比投影网络优化表示空间
3. 通过类型兼容性对齐和分离实现紧凑的最近邻检索嵌入

Result: 在三个基准测试中：
- 显著优于词法检索和密集句级检索基线
- 验证了中间层表示优于顶层嵌入
- 生成紧凑（384维）且类型敏感的嵌入表示

Conclusion: 通过模型内部表示选择和对比学习，实现了可扩展的无模式实体检索方案，为LLM表示选择提供实证支持，代码已开源推动应用落地。

Abstract: We present NER Retriever, a zero-shot retrieval framework for ad-hoc Named
Entity Retrieval, a variant of Named Entity Recognition (NER), where the types
of interest are not provided in advance, and a user-defined type description is
used to retrieve documents mentioning entities of that type. Instead of relying
on fixed schemas or fine-tuned models, our method builds on internal
representations of large language models (LLMs) to embed both entity mentions
and user-provided open-ended type descriptions into a shared semantic space. We
show that internal representations, specifically the value vectors from
mid-layer transformer blocks, encode fine-grained type information more
effectively than commonly used top-layer embeddings. To refine these
representations, we train a lightweight contrastive projection network that
aligns type-compatible entities while separating unrelated types. The resulting
entity embeddings are compact, type-aware, and well-suited for nearest-neighbor
search. Evaluated on three benchmarks, NER Retriever significantly outperforms
both lexical and dense sentence-level retrieval baselines. Our findings provide
empirical support for representation selection within LLMs and demonstrate a
practical solution for scalable, schema-free entity retrieval. The NER
Retriever Codebase is publicly available at

TL;DR: AI种族偏见显著影响人类招聘决策（即使人们认为AI不可靠），IAT测试可提升13%非刻板印象候选人选择率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究人类在AI辅助决策中的自主性，揭示AI种族偏见对招聘决策的影响机制及干预措施有效性

Method: 设计528人参与的简历筛选实验，使用模拟AI种族偏见系统（高低职业地位场景），结合IAT测试和行为数据分析

Result: AI偏见导致候选人选择率偏差达90%；IAT干预提升13%非刻板印象候选人选择；人类决策持续受AI偏见影响（即使否定AI价值）

Conclusion: 需通过组织政策（系统设计/用户教育/监管框架）应对AI-HITL决策复杂性，建立抗偏见的协作决策机制

Abstract: In this study, we conduct a resume-screening experiment (N=528) where people
collaborate with simulated AI models exhibiting race-based preferences (bias)
to evaluate candidates for 16 high and low status occupations. Simulated AI
bias approximates factual and counterfactual estimates of racial bias in
real-world AI systems. We investigate people's preferences for White, Black,
Hispanic, and Asian candidates (represented through names and affinity groups
on quality-controlled resumes) across 1,526 scenarios and measure their
unconscious associations between race and status using implicit association
tests (IATs), which predict discriminatory hiring decisions but have not been
investigated in human-AI collaboration. When making decisions without AI or
with AI that exhibits no race-based preferences, people select all candidates
at equal rates. However, when interacting with AI favoring a particular group,
people also favor those candidates up to 90% of the time, indicating a
significant behavioral shift. The likelihood of selecting candidates whose
identities do not align with common race-status stereotypes can increase by 13%
if people complete an IAT before conducting resume screening. Finally, even if
people think AI recommendations are low quality or not important, their
decisions are still vulnerable to AI bias under certain circumstances. This
work has implications for people's autonomy in AI-HITL scenarios, AI and work,
design and evaluation of AI hiring systems, and strategies for mitigating bias
in collaborative decision-making tasks. In particular, organizational and
regulatory policy should acknowledge the complex nature of AI-HITL decision
making when implementing these systems, educating people who use them, and
determining which are subject to oversight.
