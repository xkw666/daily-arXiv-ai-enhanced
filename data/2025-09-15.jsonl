Project page:\n  https://ubisoft-laforge.github.io/world/chord", "summary": "Material creation and reconstruction are crucial for appearance modeling but\ntraditionally require significant time and expertise from artists. While recent\nmethods leverage visual foundation models to synthesize PBR materials from\nuser-provided inputs, they often fall short in quality, flexibility, and user\ncontrol. We propose a novel two-stage generate-and-estimate framework for PBR\nmaterial generation. In the generation stage, a fine-tuned diffusion model\nsynthesizes shaded, tileable texture images aligned with user input. In the\nestimation stage, we introduce a chained decomposition scheme that sequentially\npredicts SVBRDF channels by passing previously extracted representation as\ninput into a single-step image-conditional diffusion model. Our method is\nefficient, high quality, and enables flexible user control. We evaluate our\napproach against existing material generation and estimation methods,\ndemonstrating superior performance. Our material estimation method shows strong\nrobustness on both generated textures and in-the-wild photographs. Furthermore,\nwe highlight the flexibility of our framework across diverse applications,\nincluding text-to-material, image-to-material, structure-guided generation, and\nmaterial editing."}

Automated coding can\npotentially alleviate this burden, improving the availability and accuracy of\nstructured clinical data. The task is difficult to automate, as it requires\nmapping to high-dimensional and long-tailed target spaces, such as the\nInternational Classification of Diseases (ICD). While external knowledge\nsources have been readily utilised to enhance output code representation, the\nuse of external resources for representing the input documents has been\nunderexplored. In this work, we compute a structured representation of the\ninput documents, making use of document-level knowledge graphs (KGs) that\nprovide a comprehensive structured view of a patient's condition.

Existing methods often lack the ability to provide\naccurate, real-time medical advice, particularly for irregular inputs and\nunderrepresented languages. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes\nan approach that fine-tunes large language models (LLMs) for Arabic medical\ntext generation. The system is designed to assist patients by providing\naccurate medical advice, diagnoses, drug recommendations, and treatment plans\nbased on user input. The research methodology required the collection of a\nunique dataset from social media platforms, capturing real-world medical\nconversations between patients and doctors. The dataset, which includes patient\ncomplaints together with medical advice, was properly cleaned and preprocessed\nto account for multiple Arabic dialects. Fine-tuning state-of-the-art\ngenerative models, such as Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2, LLaMA-2-7B, and GPT-2\nMedium, optimized the system's ability to generate reliable medical text.\nResults from evaluations indicate that the fine-tuned Mistral-7B model\noutperformed the other models, achieving average BERT (Bidirectional Encoder\nRepresentations from Transformers) Score values in precision, recall, and\nF1-scores of 68.5\\%, 69.08\\%, and 68.5\\%, respectively. Comparative\nbenchmarking and qualitative assessments validate the system's ability to\nproduce coherent and relevant medical replies to informal input.

We examine this phenomenon of incongruent\npositivity as miscalibrated expressions of positive support in both human and\nLLM generated responses. To this end, we collected real user-assistant\ndialogues from Reddit across a range of emotional intensities and generated\nadditional responses using large language models for the same context. We\ncategorize these conversations by intensity into two levels: Mild, which covers\nrelationship tension and general advice, and Severe, which covers grief and\nanxiety conversations. This level of categorization enables a comparative\nanalysis of how supportive responses vary across lower and higher stakes\ncontexts. Our analysis reveals that LLMs are more prone to unrealistic\npositivity through dismissive and minimizing tone, particularly in high-stakes\ncontexts. To further study the underlying dimensions of this phenomenon, we\nfinetune LLMs on datasets with strong and weak emotional reactions. Moreover,\nwe developed a weakly supervised multilabel classifier ensemble (DeBERTa and\nMentalBERT) that shows improved detection of incongruent positivity types\nacross two sorts of concerns (Mild and Severe).

Previous work has tried to reduce the overhead by pruning and\nmerging experts, but primarily focused on expert-level operations, leaving\nneuron-level structure underexplored. We propose DERN (Dropping Experts,\nRecombining Neurons), a task-agnostic and retraining-free framework for expert\npruning and reconstruction. We observe that experts are often misaligned and\ncontain semantic conflicts at the neuron level, which poses challenges for\ndirect merging. To solve this, DERN works in three steps: it first prunes\nredundant experts using router statistics; then it decomposes them into\nneuron-level expert segments, assigning each segment to its most compatible\nretained expert; and finally, it merges segments within each retained expert to\nbuild a compact representation. Experiments on Mixtral, Qwen, and DeepSeek SMoE\nmodels show that DERN improves performance by more than 5% on commonsense\nreasoning and MMLU benchmarks under 50% expert sparsity, without extra\ntraining.

This has led to\nclaims about these model's ability to solve (learn) unseen tasks with only a\nfew shots (exemplars) in the prompt. However, deduction does not always imply\nlearning, as ICL does not explicitly encode a given observation. Instead, the\nmodels rely on their prior knowledge and the exemplars given, if any. We argue\nthat, mathematically, ICL does constitute learning, but its full\ncharacterisation requires empirical work. We then carry out a large-scale\nanalysis of ICL ablating out or accounting for memorisation, pretraining,\ndistributional shifts, and prompting style and phrasing. We find that ICL is an\neffective learning paradigm, but limited in its ability to learn and generalise\nto unseen tasks. We note that, in the limit where exemplars become more\nnumerous, accuracy is insensitive to exemplar distribution, model, prompt\nstyle, and the input's linguistic features. Instead, it deduces patterns from\nregularities in the prompt, which leads to distributional sensitivity,\nespecially in prompting styles such as chain-of-thought.

Towards this, one promising line of work has been the use of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) for simulating user behavior. However, aligning\nthese general-purpose large pre-trained models with user preferences\nnecessitates: (i) effectively and continously parsing large-scale tabular\nuser-item interaction data, (ii) overcoming pre-training-induced inductive\nbiases to accurately learn user specific knowledge, and (iii) achieving the\nformer two at scale for millions of users. While most previous works have\nfocused on complex methods to prompt an LLM or fine-tune it on tabular\ninteraction datasets, our approach shifts the focus to extracting robust\ntextual user representations using a frozen LLM and simulating cost-effective,\nresource-efficient user agents powered by fine-tuned Small Language Models\n(SLMs). Further, we showcase a method for training multiple low-rank adapters\nfor groups of users or \\textit{persona}, striking an optimal balance between\nscalability and performance of user behavior agents. Our experiments provide\ncompelling empirical evidence of the efficacy of our methods, demonstrating\nthat user agents developed using our approach have the potential to bridge the\ngap between offline metrics and real-world performance of recommender systems."}

While most\nexisting approaches leverage LLMs for code generation to create or refine\nspecific heuristics, they often overlook the structural properties of\nindividual problem instances. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that\nintegrates LLMs with a Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA) to solve the\nNP-hard Longest Run Subsequence problem. Our approach extends the\ninstance-driven heuristic bias paradigm by introducing a human-LLM\ncollaborative process to co-design and implement a set of computationally\nefficient metrics. The LLM analyzes these instance-specific metrics to generate\na tailored heuristic bias, which steers the BRKGA toward promising areas of the\nsearch space. We conduct a comprehensive experimental evaluation, including\nrigorous statistical tests, convergence and behavioral analyses, and targeted\nablation studies, comparing our method against a standard BRKGA baseline across\n1,050 generated instances of varying complexity.
