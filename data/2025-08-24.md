### [1] [Efficient Switchable Safety Control in LLMs via Magic-Token-Guided Co-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14904)
*Jianfeng Si,Lin Sun,Zhewen Tan,Xiangzheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出统一协同训练框架实现LLM内容安全，通过单阶段训练整合正向/负向/拒绝三类安全行为，支持动态切换且大幅降低训练部署成本，8B模型安全性能超越DeepSeek-R1(671B)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全对齐方法(SFT/RLHF)存在多阶段训练流程复杂、部署后缺乏细粒度可控性的缺陷，需开发更高效灵活的解决方案。

Method: 设计协同训练框架：1）单阶段SFT集成三类安全行为（正向合法/负向风险/拒绝保守）；2）通过系统指令或魔法token动态激活不同模式；3）构建安全对齐边际实现响应分布分离。

Result: 1）安全性能匹配SFT+DPO组合，8B模型安全指标超越DeepSeek-R1；2）训练复杂度降低80%；3）首次实现基于上游审核信号的上下文感知拒绝能力。

Conclusion: 该框架通过安全行为协同训练与动态切换机制，实现了高效可扩展的内容安全解决方案，为LLM安全可控部署提供新范式。

Abstract: Current methods for content safety in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF), often rely on multi-stage training pipelines and lack fine-grained,
post-deployment controllability. To address these limitations, we propose a
unified co-training framework that efficiently integrates multiple safety
behaviors: positive (lawful/prosocial), negative (unfiltered/risk-prone) and
rejective (refusal-oriented/conservative) within a single SFT stage. Notably,
each behavior is dynamically activated via a simple system-level instruction,
or magic token, enabling stealthy and efficient behavioral switching at
inference time. This flexibility supports diverse deployment scenarios, such as
positive for safe user interaction, negative for internal red-teaming, and
rejective for context-aware refusals triggered by upstream moderation signals.
This co-training strategy induces a distinct Safety Alignment Margin in the
output space, characterized by well-separated response distributions
corresponding to each safety mode. The existence of this margin provides
empirical evidence for the model's safety robustness and enables unprecedented
fine-grained control. Experiments show that our method matches the safety
alignment quality of SFT+DPO, with our 8B model notably surpassing DeepSeek-R1
(671B) in safety performance, while significantly reducing both training
complexity and deployment costs. This work presents a scalable, efficient, and
highly controllable solution for LLM content safety.

TL;DR: WMT25机器翻译任务初步自动排名公布（存在算法偏倚风险），最终排名将以人工评估为准


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在官方人工评估结果公布前，为任务参与者提供自动评估的阶段性参考，辅助其完善系统论文

Method: 基于自动指标对机器翻译系统进行初步排名，但指出可能存在的算法偏倚（如重排序技术带来的优势）

Result: 自动排名结果存在系统性偏倚风险，强调该结果仅作为过渡性参考

Conclusion: 最终权威排名需等待人工评估，当前自动评估数据仅用于支持参与者论文准备工作

Abstract: We present the preliminary ranking of the WMT25 General Machine Translation
Shared Task, in which MT systems have been evaluated using automatic metrics.
As this ranking is based on automatic evaluations, it may be biased in favor of
systems that employ re-ranking techniques, such as Quality Estimation
re-ranking or Minimum Bayes Risk decoding. The official WMT25 ranking will be
based on human evaluation, which is more reliable and will supersede the
automatic ranking.
  The purpose of this report is not to present the final findings of the
General MT task, but rather to share preliminary results with task
participants, which may be useful when preparing their system submission
papers.

### [3] [Bridging the Culture Gap: A Framework for LLM-Driven Socio-Cultural Localization of Math Word Problems in Low-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14913)
*Israel Abebe Azime,Tadesse Destaw Belay,Dietrich Klakow,Philipp Slusallek,Anshuman Chhabra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出LLM驱动的文化本地化框架，自动生成包含本土实体的数学应用题数据集，缓解英语中心偏差并提升多语言模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言数学推理因缺乏反映本土实体（如人名、货币）的文化数据集而落后，现有基准多为翻译且保留英语实体。

Method: 开发LLM驱动的自动化框架，从现有数据源构建含本土名称、机构、货币的本地化数学应用题数据集。

Result: 实验表明该框架有效降低英语中心实体偏差，引入本土实体后提升多语言模型的上下文适应能力和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 框架解决了本土化数据集稀缺问题，证明文化适配对真实多语言数学能力评估的重要性，为低资源语言NLP提供新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in
solving mathematical problems expressed in natural language. However,
multilingual and culturally-grounded mathematical reasoning in low-resource
languages lags behind English due to the scarcity of socio-cultural task
datasets that reflect accurate native entities such as person names,
organization names, and currencies. Existing multilingual benchmarks are
predominantly produced via translation and typically retain English-centric
entities, owing to the high cost associated with human annotater-based
localization. Moreover, automated localization tools are limited, and hence,
truly localized datasets remain scarce. To bridge this gap, we introduce a
framework for LLM-driven cultural localization of math word problems that
automatically constructs datasets with native names, organizations, and
currencies from existing sources. We find that translated benchmarks can
obscure true multilingual math ability under appropriate socio-cultural
contexts. Through extensive experiments, we also show that our framework can
help mitigate English-centric entity bias and improves robustness when native
entities are introduced across various languages.

### [4] [Improving LLMs for Machine Translation Using Synthetic Preference Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14951)
*Dario Vajda,Domen Vreš,Marko Robnik-Šikonja*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过DPO训练优化指令调优大语言模型，使用程序化增强的数据集在斯洛文尼亚语翻译任务中实现COMET分数提升和错误减少


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何利用少量易获取数据资源提升通用指令调优大语言模型在低资源语言机器翻译任务中的性能表现

Method: 1. 构建程序化筛选的增强数据集
2. 使用GaMS-9B和EuroLLM-9B生成对比翻译对
3. 结合COMET等指标和启发式方法进行质量排序
4. 应用DPO直接偏好优化训练策略

Result: 微调模型在维基百科翻译任务中：
- 相较基线模型分别获得0.04和0.02的COMET分数提升
- 显著降低语言格式错误率
- 输出稳定性增强

Conclusion: 验证了DPO训练结合质量分级数据集能有效提升翻译质量，为低资源语言场景提供了高效优化方案

Abstract: Large language models have emerged as effective machine translation systems.
In this paper, we explore how a general instruction-tuned large language model
can be improved for machine translation using relatively few easily produced
data resources. Using Slovene as a use case, we improve the GaMS-9B-Instruct
model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training on a programmatically
curated and enhanced subset of a public dataset. As DPO requires pairs of
quality-ranked instances, we generated its training dataset by translating
English Wikipedia articles using two LLMs, GaMS-9B-Instruct and
EuroLLM-9B-Instruct. We ranked the resulting translations based on heuristics
coupled with automatic evaluation metrics such as COMET. The evaluation shows
that our fine-tuned model outperforms both models involved in the dataset
generation. In comparison to the baseline models, the fine-tuned model achieved
a COMET score gain of around 0.04 and 0.02, respectively, on translating
Wikipedia articles. It also more consistently avoids language and formatting
errors.

### [5] [Multilingual Datasets for Custom Input Extraction and Explanation Requests Parsing in Conversational XAI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14982)
*Qianli Wang,Tatiana Anikina,Nils Feldhus,Simon Ostermann,Fedor Splitt,Jiaao Li,Yoana Tsoneva,Sebastian Möller,Vera Schmitt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出MultiCoXQL多语言对话解释数据集和Compass自定义输入提取数据集，评估大语言模型在跨语言场景下的解析性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对话式可解释AI系统面临多语言训练数据稀缺和用户自定义输入支持不足的挑战

Method: 扩展CoXQL数据集为MultiCoXQL覆盖五国语言，开发新解析方法；创建包含11种意图的Compass数据集，进行单语/跨语言/多语言评估

Result: 在MultiCoXQL测试三种LLM解析策略，在Compass评估不同规模LLM和BERT类模型的性能表现

Conclusion: 通过多语言数据集构建和新解析方法，提升了对话式可解释AI系统的多语言适应能力和自定义输入处理能力

Abstract: Conversational explainable artificial intelligence (ConvXAI) systems based on
large language models (LLMs) have garnered considerable attention for their
ability to enhance user comprehension through dialogue-based explanations.
Current ConvXAI systems often are based on intent recognition to accurately
identify the user's desired intention and map it to an explainability method.
While such methods offer great precision and reliability in discerning users'
underlying intentions for English, a significant challenge in the scarcity of
training data persists, which impedes multilingual generalization. Besides, the
support for free-form custom inputs, which are user-defined data distinct from
pre-configured dataset instances, remains largely limited. To bridge these
gaps, we first introduce MultiCoXQL, a multilingual extension of the CoXQL
dataset spanning five typologically diverse languages, including one
low-resource language. Subsequently, we propose a new parsing approach aimed at
enhancing multilingual parsing performance, and evaluate three LLMs on
MultiCoXQL using various parsing strategies. Furthermore, we present Compass, a
new multilingual dataset designed for custom input extraction in ConvXAI
systems, encompassing 11 intents across the same five languages as MultiCoXQL.
We conduct monolingual, cross-lingual, and multilingual evaluations on Compass,
employing three LLMs of varying sizes alongside BERT-type models.

### [6] [Reward-Shifted Speculative Sampling Is An Efficient Test-Time Weak-to-Strong Aligner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15044)
*Bolian Li,Yanran Wu,Xinyu Luo,Ruqi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出奖励偏移推测采样（SSS）算法，通过在推理阶段对齐草稿模型而非目标模型，以低成本实现LLM的人类偏好对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时对齐方法计算成本过高，限制了实际应用。受推测采样加速技术启发，希望解决测试时对齐的效率瓶颈。

Method: 让草稿模型与人类偏好对齐，保持目标模型不变。通过修改接受标准和奖励token分布，利用对齐/未对齐模型间的分布偏移恢复RLHF最优解。

Result: 在弱到强对齐实验中，以显著降低的推理成本获得更优的黄金奖励分数（gold reward scores）。

Conclusion: SSS算法同时验证了测试时对齐方法的有效性和高效性，为低成本实现LLM安全对齐提供了新思路。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has become a
critical step in their development. Recent research has increasingly focused on
test-time alignment, where additional compute is allocated during inference to
enhance LLM safety and reasoning capabilities. However, these test-time
alignment techniques often incur substantial inference costs, limiting their
practical application. We are inspired by the speculative sampling
acceleration, which leverages a small draft model to efficiently predict future
tokens, to address the efficiency bottleneck of test-time alignment. We
introduce the reward-Shifted Speculative Sampling (SSS) algorithm, in which the
draft model is aligned with human preferences, while the target model remains
unchanged. We theoretically demonstrate that the distributional shift between
the aligned draft model and the unaligned target model can be exploited to
recover the RLHF optimal solution without actually obtaining it, by modifying
the acceptance criterion and bonus token distribution. Our algorithm achieves
superior gold reward scores at a significantly reduced inference cost in
test-time weak-to-strong alignment experiments, thereby validating both its
effectiveness and efficiency.

### [7] [LongRecall: A Structured Approach for Robust Recall Evaluation in Long-Form Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15085)
*MohamamdJavad Ardestani,Ehsan Kamalloo,Davood Rafiei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出LongRecall三阶段框架，通过结构化验证提升长文本生成任务的召回率评估准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有召回评估指标过度依赖词汇重叠导致漏检，LLM整体评估方法存在语义偏差和幻觉问题，在医疗/法律等关键领域亟需更可靠的评估体系

Method: 1. 分解答案为独立事实单元 2. 词法+语义双重过滤候选匹配 3. 结构化蕴涵验证对齐

Result: 在三个长文本QA基准测试中，相对基线方法实现显著准确率提升（人工标注和LLM评估双重验证）

Conclusion: LongRecall通过系统化的事实分解与验证流程，为关键领域文本完整性评估提供了可靠的基础框架

Abstract: LongRecall. The completeness of machine-generated text, ensuring that it
captures all relevant information, is crucial in domains such as medicine and
law and in tasks like list-based question answering (QA), where omissions can
have serious consequences. However, existing recall metrics often depend on
lexical overlap, leading to errors with unsubstantiated entities and
paraphrased answers, while LLM-as-a-Judge methods with long holistic prompts
capture broader semantics but remain prone to misalignment and hallucinations
without structured verification. We introduce LongRecall, a general three-stage
recall evaluation framework that decomposes answers into self-contained facts,
successively narrows plausible candidate matches through lexical and semantic
filtering, and verifies their alignment through structured entailment checks.
This design reduces false positives and false negatives while accommodating
diverse phrasings and contextual variations, serving as a foundational building
block for systematic recall assessment. We evaluate LongRecall on three
challenging long-form QA benchmarks using both human annotations and LLM-based
judges, demonstrating substantial improvements in recall accuracy over strong
lexical and LLM-as-a-Judge baselines.

### [8] [Mapping the Course for Prompt-based Structured Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15090)
*Matt Pauk,Maria Leonor Pacheco*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 将大语言模型与符号推理结合，通过结构化预测提升生成一致性与准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在结构化预测任务中存在的幻觉问题和推理局限性，探索符号推理与LLM置信度估计的协同作用

Method: 采用多种提示策略估计LLM置信度，结合符号推理进行组合优化，并通过结构化目标进行校准和微调

Result: 符号推理显著提升预测一致性（准确率提升4.6%），结构化微调使复杂任务性能提升21%

Conclusion: 结构化预测方法在LLM时代仍具价值，符号推理与提示工程结合可突破现有性能瓶颈

Abstract: LLMs have been shown to be useful for a variety of language tasks, without
requiring task-specific fine-tuning. However, these models often struggle with
hallucinations and complex reasoning problems due to their autoregressive
nature. We propose to address some of these issues, specifically in the area of
structured prediction, by combining LLMs with combinatorial inference in an
attempt to marry the predictive power of LLMs with the structural consistency
provided by inference methods. We perform exhaustive experiments in an effort
to understand which prompting strategies can effectively estimate LLM
confidence values for use with symbolic inference, and show that, regardless of
the prompting strategy, the addition of symbolic inference on top of prompting
alone leads to more consistent and accurate predictions. Additionally, we show
that calibration and fine-tuning using structured prediction objectives leads
to increased performance for challenging tasks, showing that structured
learning is still valuable in the era of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出从Common Crawl可靠提取数学内容的创新流程，构建高质量数学语料库Nemotron-CC-Math，显著提升LLM的数学推理和代码能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学数据集因脆弱的提取启发式方法、信息丢失的HTML转换和无法保持数学结构导致质量低下，需要更可靠的科学内容提取方法

Method: 结合基于布局感知的lynx渲染和LLM清洁阶段，支持多格式数学符号恢复，将数学标准化为LaTeX表示，同时保留代码块结构完整性

Result: 构建133B和52B token规模的高质量数学语料库，在8B模型预训练中实现MATH提升4.8-12.6点，MBPP+提升4.6-14.3点，并改善MMLU通用领域表现

Conclusion: 首次实现从噪声数据中可靠提取科学内容的技术突破，确立数学预训练语料库新标杆，通过开源推动AI社区发展

Abstract: Pretraining large language models (LLMs) on high-quality, structured data
such as mathematics and code substantially enhances reasoning capabilities.
However, existing math-focused datasets built from Common Crawl suffer from
degraded quality due to brittle extraction heuristics, lossy HTML-to-text
conversion, and the failure to reliably preserve mathematical structure. In
this work, we introduce Nemotron-CC-Math, a large-scale, high-quality
mathematical corpus constructed from Common Crawl using a novel,
domain-agnostic pipeline specifically designed for robust scientific text
extraction.
  Unlike previous efforts, our pipeline recovers math across various formats
(e.g., MathJax, KaTeX, MathML) by leveraging layout-aware rendering with lynx
and a targeted LLM-based cleaning stage. This approach preserves the structural
integrity of equations and code blocks while removing boilerplate,
standardizing notation into LaTeX representation, and correcting
inconsistencies.
  We collected a large, high-quality math corpus, namely Nemotron-CC-Math-3+
(133B tokens) and Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ (52B tokens). Notably,
Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ not only surpasses all prior open math datasets-including
MegaMath, FineMath, and OpenWebMath-but also contains 5.5 times more tokens
than FineMath-4+, which was previously the highest-quality math pretraining
dataset. When used to pretrain a Nemotron-T 8B model, our corpus yields +4.8 to
+12.6 gains on MATH and +4.6 to +14.3 gains on MBPP+ over strong baselines,
while also improving general-domain performance on MMLU and MMLU-Stem.
  We present the first pipeline to reliably extract scientific
content--including math--from noisy web-scale data, yielding measurable gains
in math, code, and general reasoning, and setting a new state of the art among
open math pretraining corpora. To support open-source efforts, we release our
code and datasets.

### [10] [Identifying and Answering Questions with False Assumptions: An Interpretable Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15139)
*Zijie Wang,Eduardo Blanco*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出结合检索证据和验证原子假设的方法，减少LLM在回答错误假设问题时的幻觉


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs因幻觉问题会对含有错误假设的问题生成误导性回答，需改进回答机制

Method: 将问题简化为事实核查，利用外部证据验证假设，通过生成原子假设实现可解释性验证

Result: 实验表明检索证据可提升效果，原子假设验证带来12.6%准确率提升并提供可解释依据

Conclusion: 结合证据检索与原子假设验证的方法有效改善LLM回答质量并增强可解释性

Abstract: People often ask questions with false assumptions, a type of question that
does not have regular answers. Answering such questions require first
identifying the false assumptions. Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate
misleading answers because of hallucinations. In this paper, we focus on
identifying and answering questions with false assumptions in several domains.
We first investigate to reduce the problem to fact verification. Then, we
present an approach leveraging external evidence to mitigate hallucinations.
Experiments with five LLMs demonstrate that (1) incorporating retrieved
evidence is beneficial and (2) generating and validating atomic assumptions
yields more improvements and provides an interpretable answer by specifying the
false assumptions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了多模态对话推理基准MMDR-Bench及增强框架CoLVLM Agent，通过循环机制提升多模态交互性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言/视觉语言模型在复杂多轮对话任务中存在上下文丢失、视觉幻觉等问题，缺乏动态多模态交互评估基准

Method: 开发包含300个复杂对话场景的MMDR-Bench基准，提出基于'记忆-感知-规划-执行'迭代循环的CoLVLM框架，无需重新训练基础模型

Result: 在人类评估中获得4.03分，超越GPT-4o(3.92)和Gemini 1.5 Pro(3.85)，在推理深度和错误抑制方面表现突出

Conclusion: 模块化设计和迭代方法有效提升复杂多模态交互性能，验证框架在持续对话中的鲁棒性

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), current models still face substantial
challenges in handling complex, multi-turn, and visually-grounded tasks that
demand deep reasoning, sustained contextual understanding, entity tracking, and
multi-step instruction following. Existing benchmarks often fall short in
capturing the dynamism and intricacies of real-world multi-modal interactions,
leading to issues such as context loss and visual hallucinations. To address
these limitations, we introduce MMDR-Bench (Multi-Modal Dialogue Reasoning
Benchmark), a novel dataset comprising 300 meticulously designed complex
multi-turn dialogue scenarios, each averaging 5-7 turns and evaluated across
six core dimensions including visual entity tracking and reasoning depth.
Furthermore, we propose CoLVLM Agent (Contextual LVLM Agent), a holistic
framework that enhances existing LVLMs with advanced reasoning and instruction
following capabilities through an iterative
"memory-perception-planning-execution" cycle, requiring no extensive
re-training of the underlying models. Our extensive experiments on MMDR-Bench
demonstrate that CoLVLM Agent consistently achieves superior performance,
attaining an average human evaluation score of 4.03, notably surpassing
state-of-the-art commercial models like GPT-4o (3.92) and Gemini 1.5 Pro
(3.85). The framework exhibits significant advantages in reasoning depth,
instruction adherence, and error suppression, and maintains robust performance
over extended dialogue turns, validating the effectiveness of its modular
design and iterative approach for complex multi-modal interactions.

*Dong Liu,Yanxuan Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出SemToken语义分词框架，通过语义聚类和异粒度分词实现2.4倍token压缩和1.9倍加速，保持模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有BPE/WordPiece分词方法仅依赖词频统计，忽略语义结构，导致长文本场景下冗余分词和上下文连贯性利用不足

Method: 1. 通过轻量级编码器提取语义嵌入并进行局部语义聚类
2. 根据语义密度分配异粒度分词（内容密集区细粒度，重复区粗粒度）
3. 兼容现有注意力加速方法

Result: 在WikiText-103和LongBench基准上实现：
- 分词数量减少2.4倍
- 推理速度提升1.9倍
- PPL和下游任务准确率基本无损

Conclusion: 语义结构为LLM分词优化和计算效率提升提供了新的优化维度

Abstract: Tokenization plays a critical role in language modeling, yet existing
approaches such as Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) or WordPiece operate purely on
frequency statistics, ignoring the underlying semantic structure of text. This
leads to over-tokenization of semantically redundant spans and underutilization
of contextual coherence, particularly in long-context scenarios. In this work,
we propose \textbf{SemToken}, a semantic-aware tokenization framework that
jointly reduces token redundancy and improves computation efficiency. SemToken
first extracts contextual semantic embeddings via lightweight encoders and
performs local semantic clustering to merge semantically equivalent tokens.
Then, it allocates heterogeneous token granularity based on semantic density,
allowing finer-grained tokenization in content-rich regions and coarser
compression in repetitive or low-entropy spans. SemToken can be seamlessly
integrated with modern language models and attention acceleration methods.
Experiments on long-context language modeling benchmarks such as WikiText-103
and LongBench show that SemToken achieves up to $2.4\times$ reduction in token
count and $1.9\times$ speedup, with negligible or no degradation in perplexity
and downstream accuracy. Our findings suggest that semantic structure offers a
promising new axis for optimizing tokenization and computation in large
language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Fin-PRM领域专用过程奖励模型，通过整合步骤级与轨迹级监督机制，在金融推理任务中显著提升LLM中间步骤评估效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PRM模型在金融等结构化、符号化且对事实与合规性敏感的专业领域表现不足，需开发领域专用评估框架以提升推理准确性。

Method: 设计轨迹感知PRM架构，结合步骤级奖励（评估单步逻辑）与轨迹级奖励（整体合规性）。支持监督微调、强化学习奖励生成、Best-of-N推理三大应用场景。

Result: 在CFLUE/FinQA基准测试中：轨迹选择质量优于通用PRM 12.9%（监督学习）、5.2%（强化学习）、5.1%（测试时推理），验证领域适配的有效性。

Conclusion: 领域专用奖励建模是提升LLM专业推理能力的关键路径，Fin-PRM为金融合规自动化开辟新方向，项目资源已开源促进领域发展。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising framework for
supervising intermediate reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet
existing PRMs are primarily trained on general or Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) domains and fall short in domain-specific
contexts such as finance, where reasoning is more structured, symbolic, and
sensitive to factual and regulatory correctness. We introduce \textbf{Fin-PRM},
a domain-specialized, trajectory-aware PRM tailored to evaluate intermediate
reasoning steps in financial tasks. Fin-PRM integrates step-level and
trajectory-level reward supervision, enabling fine-grained evaluation of
reasoning traces aligned with financial logic. We apply Fin-PRM in both offline
and online reward learning settings, supporting three key applications: (i)
selecting high-quality reasoning trajectories for distillation-based supervised
fine-tuning, (ii) providing dense process-level rewards for reinforcement
learning, and (iii) guiding reward-informed Best-of-N inference at test time.
Experimental results on financial reasoning benchmarks, including CFLUE and
FinQA, demonstrate that Fin-PRM consistently outperforms general-purpose PRMs
and strong domain baselines in trajectory selection quality. Downstream models
trained with Fin-PRM yield substantial improvements with baselines, with gains
of 12.9\% in supervised learning, 5.2\% in reinforcement learning, and 5.1\% in
test-time performance. These findings highlight the value of domain-specialized
reward modeling for aligning LLMs with expert-level financial reasoning. Our
project resources will be available at https://github.com/aliyun/qwen-dianjin.

*Huanxuan Liao,Yixing Xu,Shizhu He,Guanchen Li,Xuanwu Yin,Dong Li,Emad Barsoum,Jun Zhao,Kang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出SPARK方法，通过通道级稀疏化剪裁KV缓存，在降低内存占用的同时保持模型精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存压缩方法仅关注时间轴压缩，忽视了特征维度的重要性差异，导致效率与精度的平衡受限。研究发现不同特征通道的重要性存在显著差异，需针对性优化。

Method: 采用无训练的即插即用方案：1. 通道级KV剪裁；2. 注意力计算时动态恢复被剪裁条目；3. 与现有KV压缩/量化技术正交兼容。

Result: 同等序列长度下比逐出方法减少30%+ KV存储，80%激进剪裁时性能下降<5%；支持更长序列处理，兼容现有加速技术实现叠加优化。

Conclusion: 通道级稀疏化有效平衡效率与精度，突破长上下文推理的KV缓存瓶颈，为LLM优化提供新维度。

Abstract: Long-context inference in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
constrained by the KV cache bottleneck: memory usage grows linearly with
sequence length, while attention computation scales quadratically. Existing
approaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal
axis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and
computational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained
importance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis),
thereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model
accuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically
across both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero
information for a given query, while others spike in relevance. To address this
oversight, we propose SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies
unstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically
restoring the pruned entries during attention score computation. Notably, our
approach is orthogonal to existing KV compression and quantization techniques,
making it compatible for integration with them to achieve further acceleration.
By reducing channel-level redundancy, SPARK enables processing of longer
sequences within the same memory budget. For sequences of equal length, SPARK
not only preserves or improves model accuracy but also reduces KV cache storage
by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods. Furthermore, even with an
aggressive pruning ratio of 80%, SPARK maintains performance with less
degradation than 5% compared to the baseline eviction method, demonstrating its
robustness and effectiveness. Our code will be available at

TL;DR: 提出Selct2Know框架，通过知识自选择策略和选择性微调实现低成本领域知识内化，在专业QA任务中优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法存在幻觉/延迟问题，持续预训练成本高且跨领域适应性差，需模拟人类渐进式学习过程解决知识长尾分布问题

Method: 1. 内部-外部知识自选择策略
2. 结构化推理数据生成管道
3. 整合GRPO增强推理能力
4. 选择性监督微调机制

Result: 在医疗/法律/金融QA基准测试中持续超越现有方法，性能匹配领域预训练模型且成本降低92%

Conclusion: S2K框架通过渐进式知识内化路径，实现成本效益与模型性能的最佳平衡，为领域适应性问题提供新解决方案

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in general QA but often struggle in
domain-specific scenarios. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces
external knowledge but suffers from hallucinations and latency due to noisy
retrievals. Continued pretraining internalizes domain knowledge but is costly
and lacks cross-domain flexibility. We attribute this challenge to the
long-tail distribution of domain knowledge, which leaves partial yet useful
internal knowledge underutilized. We further argue that knowledge acquisition
should be progressive, mirroring human learning: first understanding concepts,
then applying them to complex reasoning. To address this, we propose Selct2Know
(S2K), a cost-effective framework that internalizes domain knowledge through an
internal-external knowledge self-selection strategy and selective supervised
fine-tuning. We also introduce a structured reasoning data generation pipeline
and integrate GRPO to enhance reasoning ability. Experiments on medical, legal,
and financial QA benchmarks show that S2K consistently outperforms existing
methods and matches domain-pretrained LLMs with significantly lower cost.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出SEER方法通过逐步经验检索增强LLMs多工具调用能力，在ToolQA基准和真实场景测试中显著提升准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具调用方法依赖人工设计或静态经验库，难以应对复杂多步骤任务，且扩展性差。SEER旨在通过动态经验池实现自动化、持续优化的工具调用。

Method: SEER采用逐步经验回忆机制，从持续更新的经验池中执行细粒度检索，增量积累成功轨迹，无需人工维护经验库。

Result: ToolQA基准测试中，SEER在简单/困难问题上分别提升6.1%/4.7%；在τ-bench真实场景中，Qwen2.5-7B/72B模型分别获得7.44%/23.38%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: SEER通过动态经验池实现LLMs工具调用能力的自主进化，实验证明其在不同模型规模和任务难度下均具有显著效果提升。

Abstract: Function calling enables large language models (LLMs) to interact with
external systems by leveraging tools and APIs. When faced with multi-step tool
usage, LLMs still struggle with tool selection, parameter generation, and
tool-chain planning. Existing methods typically rely on manually designing
task-specific demonstrations, or retrieving from a curated library. These
approaches demand substantial expert effort and prompt engineering becomes
increasingly complex and inefficient as tool diversity and task difficulty
scale. To address these challenges, we propose a self-guided method, Stepwise
Experience Recall (SEER), which performs fine-grained, stepwise retrieval from
a continually updated experience pool. Instead of relying on static or manually
curated library, SEER incrementally augments the experience pool with past
successful trajectories, enabling continuous expansion of the pool and improved
model performance over time. Evaluated on the ToolQA benchmark, SEER achieves
an average improvement of 6.1\% on easy and 4.7\% on hard questions. We further
test SEER on $\tau$-bench, which includes two real-world domains. Powered by
Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-72B models, SEER demonstrates substantial accuracy gains
of 7.44\% and 23.38\%, respectively.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了选择性使用自动生成的检查清单在评估生成任务中的有效性，发现其在成对比较中有效但直接评分效果不一，指出需明确评估标准以减少人工评估的不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动评估生成任务时因标准模糊面临挑战，尽管自动检查清单有潜力，但其有效性尚未充分探索。研究旨在验证检查清单应全面使用还是选择性使用，并分析其与人工评估的相关性。

Method: 通过6种方法生成检查清单，评估8种不同规模模型的效果，识别与人工评估相关的检查项，并在成对比较/直接评分任务中验证有效性。

Result: 选择性使用检查清单在成对比较中提升评估效果，但在直接评分中效果不稳定；低相关性检查项仍反映人工标准，揭示人工评估存在潜在矛盾。

Conclusion: 需明确界定客观评估标准以指导人工和自动评估流程，减少因主观标准导致的不一致性。

Abstract: Automatic evaluation of generative tasks using large language models faces
challenges due to ambiguous criteria. Although automatic checklist generation
is a potentially promising approach, its usefulness remains underexplored. We
investigate whether checklists should be used for all questions or selectively,
generate them using six methods, evaluate their effectiveness across eight
model sizes, and identify checklist items that correlate with human
evaluations. Through experiments on pairwise comparison and direct scoring
tasks, we find that selective checklist use tends to improve evaluation
performance in pairwise settings, while its benefits are less consistent in
direct scoring. Our analysis also shows that even checklist items with low
correlation to human scores often reflect human-written criteria, indicating
potential inconsistencies in human evaluation. These findings highlight the
need to more clearly define objective evaluation criteria to guide both human
and automatic evaluations. \footnote{Our code is available

TL;DR: VocabTailor提出动态词汇选择框架，通过嵌入卸载和混合策略将词汇相关组件内存占用降低99%，在保持性能的同时解决小语言模型内存瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态词汇修剪方法存在信息损失和灵活性不足的问题，无法适应边缘设备部署需求。小语言模型(SLM)中词汇相关组件(嵌入和LM头)因大词汇量导致内存占用过高。

Method: 基于词汇局部性原则(单次推理仅需少量token)和计算不对称性原则，设计解耦框架：1) 嵌入组件通过卸载减少内存 2) LM头采用混合静态-动态词汇选择策略按需加载。

Result: 跨任务实验表明，VocabTailor在词汇相关组件内存降低99%的情况下保持任务性能，显著优于静态修剪方法。

Conclusion: 动态词汇选择框架有效平衡内存效率与模型性能，为边缘设备部署SLM提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) provide computational advantages in
resource-constrained environments, yet memory limitations remain a critical
bottleneck for edge device deployment. A substantial portion of SLMs' memory
footprint stems from vocabulary-related components, particularly embeddings and
language modeling (LM) heads, due to large vocabulary sizes. Existing static
vocabulary pruning, while reducing memory usage, suffers from rigid,
one-size-fits-all designs that cause information loss from the prefill stage
and a lack of flexibility. In this work, we identify two key principles
underlying the vocabulary reduction challenge: the lexical locality principle,
the observation that only a small subset of tokens is required during any
single inference, and the asymmetry in computational characteristics between
vocabulary-related components of SLM. Based on these insights, we introduce
VocabTailor, a novel decoupled dynamic vocabulary selection framework that
addresses memory constraints through offloading embedding and implements a
hybrid static-dynamic vocabulary selection strategy for LM Head, enabling
on-demand loading of vocabulary components. Comprehensive experiments across
diverse downstream tasks demonstrate that VocabTailor achieves a reduction of
up to 99% in the memory usage of vocabulary-related components with minimal or
no degradation in task performance, substantially outperforming existing static
vocabulary pruning.

Method: 1) 构建含4领域7任务的人工标注数据集，经多阶段质量控制 2) 开展零样本评测与指令微调对比实验

Result: 使用本地数据微调的模型在领域内外任务表现均优于翻译数据模型（领域内提升8.6%，跨领域提升5.3%）

Conclusion: 文化/专业场景的本地指令数据对提升LLM在低资源语言环境中的对齐效果具有关键作用

Abstract: Large language models excel at instruction-following in English, but their
performance in low-resource languages like Thai remains underexplored. Existing
benchmarks often rely on translations, missing cultural and domain-specific
nuances needed for real-world use. We present WangchanThaiInstruct, a
human-authored Thai dataset for evaluation and instruction tuning, covering
four professional domains and seven task types. Created through a multi-stage
quality control process with annotators, domain experts, and AI researchers,
WangchanThaiInstruct supports two studies: (1) a zero-shot evaluation showing
performance gaps on culturally and professionally specific tasks, and (2) an
instruction tuning study with ablations isolating the effect of native
supervision. Models fine-tuned on WangchanThaiInstruct outperform those using
translated data in both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. These findings
underscore the need for culturally and professionally grounded instruction data
to improve LLM alignment in low-resource, linguistically diverse settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码切换场景缺乏高质量数据集限制了相关语音技术的发展，需构建不改变语义的代码切换生成方案。

Method: 基于SWORDS算法（同义词替换+词性考量）生成代码切换语音，通过UniCoM流程构建多语言CS-FLEURS语料库。

Result: CS-FLEURS在可懂度与自然度上达到现有数据集水平，主客观评估指标均表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法将推动代码切换语音技术进步，促进多语言系统的包容性发展。

Abstract: Code-switching (CS), the alternation between two or more languages within a
single speaker's utterances, is common in real-world conversations and poses
significant challenges for multilingual speech technology. However, systems
capable of handling this phenomenon remain underexplored, primarily due to the
scarcity of suitable datasets. To resolve this issue, we propose Universal
Code-Mixer (UniCoM), a novel pipeline for generating high-quality, natural CS
samples without altering sentence semantics. Our approach utilizes an algorithm
we call Substituting WORDs with Synonyms (SWORDS), which generates CS speech by
replacing selected words with their translations while considering their parts
of speech. Using UniCoM, we construct Code-Switching FLEURS (CS-FLEURS), a
multilingual CS corpus designed for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and
speech-to-text translation (S2TT). Experimental results show that CS-FLEURS
achieves high intelligibility and naturalness, performing comparably to
existing datasets on both objective and subjective metrics. We expect our
approach to advance CS speech technology and enable more inclusive multilingual
systems.

Method: 构建88个教师专属道德困境量表，设计软提示注入测试集，对12个大模型进行跨维度评估

Result: 教师模型呈现理想化人格特质，抽象道德推理优于人类，但情感处理能力较弱；模型推理能力与安全脆弱性正相关

Conclusion: 创立首个教育AI伦理心理评估基准，揭示大模型在教育应用中的能力-安全性权衡关系，提供开源测评资源

Abstract: Simulating Professions (SP) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate
professional roles. However, comprehensive psychological and ethical evaluation
in these contexts remains lacking. This paper introduces EMNLP, an
Educator-role Moral and Normative LLMs Profiling framework for personality
profiling, moral development stage measurement, and ethical risk under soft
prompt injection. EMNLP extends existing scales and constructs 88
teacher-specific moral dilemmas, enabling profession-oriented comparison with
human teachers. A targeted soft prompt injection set evaluates compliance and
vulnerability in teacher SP. Experiments on 12 LLMs show teacher-role LLMs
exhibit more idealized and polarized personalities than human teachers, excel
in abstract moral reasoning, but struggle with emotionally complex situations.
Models with stronger reasoning are more vulnerable to harmful prompt injection,
revealing a paradox between capability and safety. The model temperature and
other hyperparameters have limited influence except in some risk behaviors.
This paper presents the first benchmark to assess ethical and psychological
alignment of teacher-role LLMs for educational AI. Resources are available at

Motivation: 传统RAG在外部上下文与模型参数知识冲突时无法有效调和，导致错误知识覆盖正确记忆的问题

Method: 1. 上下文评估器编码紧凑记忆token嵌入
2. 基于对抗/基础软提示训练机制
3. 引导模型选择可靠知识源

Result: 在QA和事实核查任务上实现平均5.0%的性能提升，显著缓解上下文-记忆冲突

Conclusion: CARE为可信赖的RAG系统提供了新方向，实现了上下文可靠性动态评估与自适应推理

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances the capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge into their input
prompts. However, when the retrieved context contradicts the LLM's parametric
knowledge, it often fails to resolve the conflict between incorrect external
context and correct parametric knowledge, known as context-memory conflict. To
tackle this problem, we introduce Conflict-Aware REtrieval-Augmented Generation
(CARE), consisting of a context assessor and a base LLM. The context assessor
encodes compact memory token embeddings from raw context tokens. Through
grounded/adversarial soft prompting, the context assessor is trained to discern
unreliable context and capture a guidance signal that directs reasoning toward
the more reliable knowledge source. Extensive experiments show that CARE
effectively mitigates context-memory conflicts, leading to an average
performance gain of 5.0\% on QA and fact-checking benchmarks, establishing a
promising direction for trustworthy and adaptive RAG systems.

Method: 设计时间常识提取流程，基于SAMSum和RealNews语料构建TComQA数据集，通过众包验证和对比实验评估模型性能

Result: TComQA提取精度超80%，使用该数据训练的模型在时间问答任务中优于现有数据集微调的大模型

Conclusion: 验证了大语言模型提取时间常识的潜力，构建的高质量数据集显著提升了时间推理任务的模型表现

Abstract: Understanding events necessitates grasping their temporal context, which is
often not explicitly stated in natural language. For example, it is not a
trivial task for a machine to infer that a museum tour may last for a few
hours, but can not take months. Recent studies indicate that even advanced
large language models (LLMs) struggle in generating text that require reasoning
with temporal commonsense due to its infrequent explicit mention in text.
Therefore, automatically mining temporal commonsense for events enables the
creation of robust language models. In this work, we investigate the capacity
of LLMs to extract temporal commonsense from text and evaluate multiple
experimental setups to assess their effectiveness. Here, we propose a temporal
commonsense extraction pipeline that leverages LLMs to automatically mine
temporal commonsense and use it to construct TComQA, a dataset derived from
SAMSum and RealNews corpora. TComQA has been validated through crowdsourcing
and achieves over 80\% precision in extracting temporal commonsense. The model
trained with TComQA also outperforms an LLM fine-tuned on existing dataset of
temporal question answering task.

Motivation: 现有语音任务需要排除语境干扰的纯净音素表征。为解决传统方法依赖长语音片段和语言特定模式的问题，开发能在一个音素长度窗口内捕捉核心特征的轻量模型

Method: 使用120毫秒固定长度窗口独立处理，采用监督学习和自监督学习结合的方式，在包括UCLA语音库的零样本测试中进行多语言训练

Result: 模型参数量更少但实现竞争性跨语言性能，零样本测试显示优异泛化能力，验证基础声学模式的建模有效性

Conclusion: 通过音素长度窗口内的基础声学模式建模，可实现有效的通用语音处理，为跨语言语音分析提供新范式

Abstract: Universal phoneme recognition typically requires analyzing long speech
segments and language-specific patterns. Many speech processing tasks require
pure phoneme representations free from contextual influence, which motivated
our development of CUPE - a lightweight model that captures key phoneme
features in just 120 milliseconds, about one phoneme's length. CUPE processes
short, fixed-width windows independently and, despite fewer parameters than
current approaches, achieves competitive cross-lingual performance by learning
fundamental acoustic patterns common to all languages. Our extensive evaluation
through supervised and self-supervised training on diverse languages, including
zero-shot tests on the UCLA Phonetic Corpus, demonstrates strong cross-lingual
generalization and reveals that effective universal speech processing is
possible through modeling basic acoustic patterns within phoneme-length
windows.

Conclusion: EDAS解决了KGC评估碎片化问题，提供可靠、可解释的跨模型比较标准，推动公平评估与模型优化

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) enable applications in various domains such as
semantic search, recommendation systems, and natural language processing. KGs
are often incomplete, missing entities and relations, an issue addressed by
Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) methods that predict missing elements.
Different evaluation metrics, such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Mean Rank
(MR), and Hit@k, are commonly used to assess the performance of such KGC
models. A major challenge in evaluating KGC models, however, lies in comparing
their performance across multiple datasets and metrics. A model may outperform
others on one dataset but underperform on another, making it difficult to
determine overall superiority. Moreover, even within a single dataset,
different metrics such as MRR and Hit@1 can yield conflicting rankings, where
one model excels in MRR while another performs better in Hit@1, further
complicating model selection for downstream tasks. These inconsistencies hinder
holistic comparisons and highlight the need for a unified meta-metric that
integrates performance across all metrics and datasets to enable a more
reliable and interpretable evaluation framework. To address this need, we
propose KG Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS), a robust
and interpretable meta-metric that synthesizes model performance across
multiple datasets and diverse evaluation criteria into a single normalized
score ($M_i \in [0,1]$). Unlike traditional metrics that focus on isolated
aspects of performance, EDAS offers a global perspective that supports more
informed model selection and promotes fairness in cross-dataset evaluation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets such as FB15k-237 and WN18RR
demonstrate that EDAS effectively integrates multi-metric, multi-dataset
performance into a unified ranking, offering a consistent, robust, and
generalizable framework for evaluating KGC models.

Abstract: In recent years, with the rapid development of the depth and breadth of large
language models' capabilities, various corresponding evaluation benchmarks have
been emerging in increasing numbers. As a quantitative assessment tool for
model performance, benchmarks are not only a core means to measure model
capabilities but also a key element in guiding the direction of model
development and promoting technological innovation. We systematically review
the current status and development of large language model benchmarks for the
first time, categorizing 283 representative benchmarks into three categories:
general capabilities, domain-specific, and target-specific. General capability
benchmarks cover aspects such as core linguistics, knowledge, and reasoning;
domain-specific benchmarks focus on fields like natural sciences, humanities
and social sciences, and engineering technology; target-specific benchmarks pay
attention to risks, reliability, agents, etc. We point out that current
benchmarks have problems such as inflated scores caused by data contamination,
unfair evaluation due to cultural and linguistic biases, and lack of evaluation
on process credibility and dynamic environments, and provide a referable design
paradigm for future benchmark innovation.

Abstract: The trustworthiness of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains an
intense concern despite the significant progress in their capabilities.
Existing evaluation and mitigation approaches often focus on narrow aspects and
overlook risks introduced by the multimodality. To tackle these challenges, we
propose MultiTrust-X, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating, analyzing, and
mitigating the trustworthiness issues of MLLMs. We define a three-dimensional
framework, encompassing five trustworthiness aspects which include
truthfulness, robustness, safety, fairness, and privacy; two novel risk types
covering multimodal risks and cross-modal impacts; and various mitigation
strategies from the perspectives of data, model architecture, training, and
inference algorithms. Based on the taxonomy, MultiTrust-X includes 32 tasks and
28 curated datasets, enabling holistic evaluations over 30 open-source and
proprietary MLLMs and in-depth analysis with 8 representative mitigation
methods. Our extensive experiments reveal significant vulnerabilities in
current models, including a gap between trustworthiness and general
capabilities, as well as the amplification of potential risks in base LLMs by
both multimodal training and inference. Moreover, our controlled analysis
uncovers key limitations in existing mitigation strategies that, while some
methods yield improvements in specific aspects, few effectively address overall
trustworthiness, and many introduce unexpected trade-offs that compromise model
utility. These findings also provide practical insights for future
improvements, such as the benefits of reasoning to better balance safety and
performance. Based on these insights, we introduce a Reasoning-Enhanced Safety
Alignment (RESA) approach that equips the model with chain-of-thought reasoning
ability to discover the underlying risks, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Motivation: 传统推测解码采用静态生成长度和刚性验证标准，难以适应模型不确定性和输入复杂性变化

Method: 利用草稿模型输出分布的熵和边缘不确定性，动态调节每轮推测生成的token数量，并采用柔性验证标准

Result: 在机器翻译和摘要任务中实现显著加速，保持/提升BLEU和ROUGE分数

Conclusion: 该方法为不同不确定性条件下的高效解码提供了模块化解决方案，平衡速度与输出质量

Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating
autoregressive inference by parallelizing token generation through a
draft-then-verify paradigm. However, existing methods rely on static drafting
lengths and rigid verification criteria, limiting their adaptability across
varying model uncertainties and input complexities. This paper proposes an
information-theoretic framework for speculative decoding based on
confidence-modulated drafting. By leveraging entropy and margin-based
uncertainty measures over the drafter's output distribution, the proposed
method dynamically adjusts the number of speculatively generated tokens at each
iteration. This adaptive mechanism reduces rollback frequency, improves
resource utilization, and maintains output fidelity. Additionally, the
verification process is modulated using the same confidence signals, enabling
more flexible acceptance of drafted tokens without sacrificing generation
quality. Experiments on machine translation and summarization tasks demonstrate
significant speedups over standard speculative decoding while preserving or
improving BLEU and ROUGE scores. The proposed approach offers a principled,
plug-in method for efficient and robust decoding in large language models under
varying conditions of uncertainty.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large language models are trained with tokenizers, and the resulting token
distribution is highly imbalanced: a few words dominate the stream while most
occur rarely. Recent practice favors ever-larger vocabularies, but the source
of the benefit is unclear. We conduct a controlled study that scales the
language model's vocabulary from 24K to 196K while holding data, compute, and
optimization fixed. We first quantify the complexity of tokenized text,
formalized via Kolmogorov complexity, and show that larger vocabularies reduce
this complexity. Above 24K, every common word is already a single token, so
further growth mainly deepens the relative token-frequency imbalance. A
word-level loss decomposition shows that larger vocabularies reduce
cross-entropy almost exclusively by lowering uncertainty on the 2,500 most
frequent words, even though loss on the rare tail rises. Constraining input and
output embedding norms to attenuate the effect of token-frequency imbalance
reverses the gain, directly showing that the model exploits rather than suffers
from imbalance. Because the same frequent words cover roughly 77% of tokens in
downstream benchmarks, this training advantage transfers intact. We also show
that enlarging model parameters with a fixed vocabulary yields the same
frequent-word benefit. Our results reframe "bigger vocabularies help" as
"lowering the complexity of tokenized text helps," providing a simple,
principled lever for tokenizer-model co-design and clarifying the loss dynamics
that govern language-model scaling in pre-training.

Result: 建立包含引用/归属/引证方法的分类体系，揭示领域核心方法与评估标准碎片化问题

Conclusion: 需解决术语统一、评估标准化、基准建设等挑战，未来应加强证据溯源机制与可信生成技术研发

Abstract: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) has been accompanied
by growing concerns regarding their reliability and trustworthiness. As a
result, a growing body of research focuses on evidence-based text generation
with LLMs, aiming to link model outputs to supporting evidence to ensure
traceability and verifiability. However, the field is fragmented due to
inconsistent terminology, isolated evaluation practices, and a lack of unified
benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we systematically analyze 134 papers, introduce
a unified taxonomy of evidence-based text generation with LLMs, and investigate
300 evaluation metrics across seven key dimensions. Thereby, we focus on
approaches that use citations, attribution, or quotations for evidence-based
text generation. Building on this, we examine the distinctive characteristics
and representative methods in the field. Finally, we highlight open challenges
and outline promising directions for future work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型音语模型在多模态冲突场景下的可靠性未被充分研究，需系统性评估其模态偏好及可靠性问题。

Method: 构建MCR-BENCH基准测试，通过矛盾音文对评估模型优先级，分析影响因素并尝试监督微调缓解策略。

Result: 模型在矛盾输入时文本偏倚达65%，音频任务性能下降40%，监督微调仅有限改善，模型存在持续过度自信现象。

Conclusion: 应优化多模态融合机制与平衡训练策略，开发更鲁棒的冲突处理框架以确保实际应用可靠性。

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are enhanced with audio perception
capabilities, enabling them to effectively process and understand multimodal
inputs that combine audio and text. However, their performance in handling
conflicting information between audio and text modalities remains largely
unexamined. This paper introduces MCR-BENCH, the first comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate how LALMs prioritize information when
presented with inconsistent audio-text pairs. Through extensive evaluation
across diverse audio understanding tasks, we reveal a concerning phenomenon:
when inconsistencies exist between modalities, LALMs display a significant bias
toward textual input, frequently disregarding audio evidence. This tendency
leads to substantial performance degradation in audio-centric tasks and raises
important reliability concerns for real-world applications. We further
investigate the influencing factors of text bias, and explore mitigation
strategies through supervised finetuning, and analyze model confidence patterns
that reveal persistent overconfidence even with contradictory inputs. These
findings underscore the need for improved modality balance during training and
more sophisticated fusion mechanisms to enhance the robustness when handling
conflicting multi-modal inputs. The project is available at

Result: 基准模型标准化得分0.72超越同类，发现广泛训练提升性能但存在音频场景泛化缺口

Conclusion: 通过完整开源生态建立语音语言模型研究新标准，推动社区协作加速LSLMs发展

Abstract: The development of Large Speech-Language Models (LSLMs) has been slowed by
fragmented architectures and a lack of transparency, hindering the systematic
comparison and reproducibility of research. Unlike in the vision-language
domain, the LSLM field suffers from the common practice of releasing model
weights without their corresponding training data and configurations. To
address these critical gaps, we introduce LLaSO, the first fully open,
end-to-end framework for large-scale speech-language modeling. LLaSO provides
the community with three essential resources: (1) LLaSO-Align, a 12M-instance
speech-text alignment corpus; (2) LLaSO-Instruct, a 13.5M-instance multi-task
instruction-tuning dataset; and (3) LLaSO-Eval, a reproducible benchmark for
standardized evaluation. To validate our framework, we build and release
LLaSO-Base, a 3.8B-parameter reference model trained exclusively on our public
data. It achieves a normalized score of 0.72, establishing a strong,
reproducible baseline that surpasses comparable models. Our analysis reveals
that while broader training coverage enhances performance, significant
generalization gaps persist on unseen tasks, particularly in pure audio
scenarios. By releasing the complete stack of data, benchmarks, and models,
LLaSO establishes a foundational open standard to unify research efforts and
accelerate community-driven progress in LSLMs. We release the code, dataset,
pretrained models, and results in https://github.com/EIT-NLP/LLaSO.

Abstract: Recent developments in language modeling have increased their use in various
applications and domains. Language models, often trained on sensitive data, can
memorize and disclose this information during privacy attacks, raising concerns
about protecting individuals' privacy rights. Preserving privacy in language
models has become a crucial area of research, as privacy is one of the
fundamental human rights. Despite its significance, understanding of how much
privacy risk these language models possess and how it can be mitigated is still
limited. This research addresses this by providing a comprehensive study of the
privacy-preserving language modeling approaches. This study gives an in-depth
overview of these approaches, highlights their strengths, and investigates
their limitations. The outcomes of this study contribute to the ongoing
research on privacy-preserving language modeling, providing valuable insights

activity but also specific mental health disorders and their underlying causes,
such as relationship challenges or financial stressors. AI models trained on
M-Help can address three key tasks: identifying help-seekers, diagnosing mental
health conditions, and uncovering the root causes of issues.

Conclusion: 系统化的翻译方法论有效提升非对等词汇的转换准确性，为跨文化交际提供可复制的解决方案。

Abstract: These pure languages understanding directly relates to translation knowledge
where linguists and translators need to work and research to eradicate
misunderstanding. Misunderstandings mostly appear in non-equivalent words
because there are different local and internal words like food, garment,
cultural and traditional words and others in every notion. Truly, most of these
words do not have equivalent in the target language and these words need to be
worked and find their equivalent in the target language to fully understand the
both languages. The purpose of this research is to introduce the methods of
rendering non-equivalent words professionally from the source language to the
target language and this research has been completed using library-based
research. However, some of these non-equivalent words are already
professionally rendered to the target language but still there many other words
to be rendered. As a result, this research paper includes different ways and
rules of rendering non-equivalent words from source language to the target
language and 25 non-equvalent words have been rendered from Dar & Uzbek into
English and Russian languages.

Motivation: 传统可编程任务对话代理依赖精准的状态跟踪，而现有方法在复杂对话场景中容易出现误差累积。PyTOD提出通过执行感知的代码生成机制提升状态跟踪的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出基于代码生成的对话状态跟踪框架：1) 使用受限解码技术让语言模型遵循API模式生成可执行代码 2) 通过策略执行结果反馈迭代修正状态追踪错误

Result: 在SGD基准上取得76.2%的联合目标准确率，显著超越传统方法。实验显示随着对话轮次增加，目标估计准确率下降幅度比基线减少35%。

Conclusion: 执行感知的状态追踪机制有效提升对话系统鲁棒性，代码生成范式为复杂对话状态管理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Programmable task-oriented dialogue (TOD) agents enable language models to
follow structured dialogue policies, but their effectiveness hinges on accurate
state tracking. We present PyTOD, an agent that generates executable code to
track dialogue state and uses policy and execution feedback for efficient error
correction. To this end, PyTOD employs a simple constrained decoding approach,
using a language model instead of grammar rules to follow API schemata. This
leads to state-of-the-art state tracking performance on the challenging SGD
benchmark. Our experiments show that PyTOD surpasses strong baselines in both
accuracy and robust user goal estimation as the dialogue progresses,
demonstrating the effectiveness of execution-aware state tracking.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有放射报告评估方法存在粗粒度评分和黑盒模型依赖的缺陷，难以满足临床需求

Method: 基于群体相对策略优化，创新子分数动态加权（根据F1统计自适应调整权重）和多数引导优势缩放（依据子分数共识调整策略梯度）

Result: 在ReXVal基准测试中超越现有方法，达到与GPT-4评估同等水平（保持可解释性且成本降低95%）

Conclusion: RadReason首次实现临床可解释、经济高效的自动化放射报告评估，为医疗AI部署提供新范式

Abstract: Evaluating automatically generated radiology reports remains a fundamental
challenge due to the lack of clinically grounded, interpretable, and
fine-grained metrics. Existing methods either produce coarse overall scores or
rely on opaque black-box models, limiting their usefulness in real-world
clinical workflows. We introduce RadReason, a novel evaluation framework for
radiology reports that not only outputs fine-grained sub-scores across six
clinically defined error types, but also produces human-readable justifications
that explain the rationale behind each score. Our method builds on Group
Relative Policy Optimization and incorporates two key innovations: (1)
Sub-score Dynamic Weighting, which adaptively prioritizes clinically
challenging error types based on live F1 statistics; and (2) Majority-Guided
Advantage Scaling, which adjusts policy gradient updates based on prompt
difficulty derived from sub-score agreement. Together, these components enable
more stable optimization and better alignment with expert clinical judgment.
Experiments on the ReXVal benchmark show that RadReason surpasses all prior
offline metrics and achieves parity with GPT-4-based evaluations, while
remaining explainable, cost-efficient, and suitable for clinical deployment.
Code will be released upon publication.

Method: 采用Google T5-Small 60M模型作为基座，通过对比学习框架（InfoNCE损失函数）在共享嵌入空间对齐客户画像与优惠方案，使用合成数据集模拟客户行为模式

Result: 实验显示对比学习策略使优惠接受率相比监督微调基线提升17%，验证了对比目标函数在个性化营销中的有效性

Conclusion: SLM4Offer证明了对比学习能有效改进生成模型，通过潜在空间重构提升模型泛化能力，为个性化营销技术提供了新方向

Abstract: Personalized marketing has emerged as a pivotal strategy for enhancing
customer engagement and driving business growth. Academic and industry efforts
have predominantly focused on recommendation systems and personalized
advertisements. Nonetheless, this facet of personalization holds significant
potential for increasing conversion rates and improving customer satisfaction.
Prior studies suggest that well-executed personalization strategies can boost
revenue by up to 40 percent, underscoring the strategic importance of
developing intelligent, data-driven approaches for offer generation. This work
introduces SLM4Offer, a generative AI model for personalized offer generation,
developed by fine-tuning a pre-trained encoder-decoder language model,
specifically Google's Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5-Small 60M) using a
contrastive learning approach. SLM4Offer employs InfoNCE (Information
Noise-Contrastive Estimation) loss to align customer personas with relevant
offers in a shared embedding space. A key innovation in SLM4Offer lies in the
adaptive learning behaviour introduced by contrastive loss, which reshapes the
latent space during training and enhances the model's generalizability. The
model is fine-tuned and evaluated on a synthetic dataset designed to simulate
customer behaviour and offer acceptance patterns. Experimental results
demonstrate a 17 percent improvement in offer acceptance rate over a supervised
fine-tuning baseline, highlighting the effectiveness of contrastive objectives
in advancing personalized marketing.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在处理用户主观、异质的浏览行为时存在局限，需验证小模型和集群化训练是否能更优捕捉用户个性化行为。

Method: 采用HeTLM（异构感知训练）方法，使用页面级分词器训练小模型，并与大模型及单一参数模型进行对比实验。

Result: 小模型优于大模型；HeTLM在相同参数量下超越单一模型，且生成结果方差更低、均值更高。

Conclusion: HeTLM证实通过集群化训练可有效解决用户行为异质性，提升模型在个体用户层面的生成一致性和对齐效果。

Abstract: A Large Language Model (LLM) offers versatility across domains and tasks,
purportedly benefiting users with a wide variety of behaviors and preferences.
We question this perception about an LLM when users have inherently subjective
behaviors and preferences, as seen in their ubiquitous and idiosyncratic
browsing of websites or apps. The sequential behavior logs of pages, thus
generated, form something akin to each user's self-constructed "language",
albeit without the structure and grammar imbued in natural languages. We ask:
(i) Can a small LM represent the "language of browsing" better than a large LM?
(ii) Can an LM with a single set of parameters (or, single LM) adequately
capture myriad users' heterogeneous, subjective behaviors and preferences?
(iii) Can a single LM with high average performance, yield low variance in
performance to make alignment good at user level? We introduce clusterwise LM
training, HeTLM (Heterogeneity aware Training of Language Model), appropriate
for subjective behaviors. We find that (i) a small LM trained using a
page-level tokenizer outperforms large pretrained or finetuned LMs; (ii) HeTLM
with heterogeneous cluster specific set of parameters outperforms a single LM
of the same family, controlling for the number of parameters; and (iii) a
higher mean and a lower variance in generation ensues, implying improved
alignment.

Motivation: 传统人类中心难度指标的课程学习在预训练中效果有限，需探索更符合模型训练规律的难度度量方式

Method: 按训练数据影响力（单个样本对模型输出的影响程度）对训练样本进行排序

Result: 采用新指标的模型在基准测试中表现超越随机顺序训练模型10个百分点以上

Conclusion: 语言模型预训练采用模型中心视角的课程学习策略具有显著优势

Abstract: Curriculum learning, a training technique where data is presented to the
model in order of example difficulty (e.g., from simpler to more complex
documents), has shown limited success for pre-training language models. In this
work, we investigate whether curriculum learning becomes competitive if we
replace conventional human-centered difficulty metrics with one that more
closely corresponds to example difficulty as observed during model training.
Specifically, we experiment with sorting training examples by their
\textit{training data influence}, a score which estimates the effect of
individual training examples on the model's output. Models trained on our
curricula are able to outperform ones trained in random order by over 10
percentage points in benchmarks, confirming that curriculum learning is
beneficial for language model pre-training, as long as a more model-centric
notion of difficulty is adopted.

rigorous comparison of their effectiveness. Unlike prior benchmarks, SLM-Bench
quantifies 11 metrics across correctness, computation, and consumption,
enabling a holistic assessment of efficiency trade-offs. Our evaluation
considers controlled hardware conditions, ensuring fair comparisons across
models. We develop an open-source benchmarking pipeline with standardized
evaluation protocols to facilitate reproducibility and further research. Our
findings highlight the diverse trade-offs among SLMs, where some models excel
in accuracy while others achieve superior energy efficiency. SLM-Bench sets a
new standard for SLM evaluation, bridging the gap between resource efficiency

Abstract: Political language is deeply intertwined with social identities. While social
identities are often shaped by specific cultural contexts and expressed through
particular uses of language, existing datasets for group and identity detection
are predominantly English-centric, single-label and focus on coarse identity
categories. We introduce HebID, the first multilabel Hebrew corpus for social
identity detection: 5,536 sentences from Israeli politicians' Facebook posts
(Dec 2018-Apr 2021), manually annotated for twelve nuanced social identities
(e.g. Rightist, Ultra-Orthodox, Socially-oriented) grounded by survey data. We
benchmark multilabel and single-label encoders alongside 2B-9B-parameter
generative LLMs, finding that Hebrew-tuned LLMs provide the best results
(macro-$F_1$ = 0.74). We apply our classifier to politicians' Facebook posts
and parliamentary speeches, evaluating differences in popularity, temporal
trends, clustering patterns, and gender-related variations in identity
expression. We utilize identity choices from a national public survey, enabling
a comparison between identities portrayed in elite discourse and the public's
identity priorities. HebID provides a comprehensive foundation for studying
social identities in Hebrew and can serve as a model for similar research in
other non-English political contexts.

Abstract: We introduce Dream 7B, the most powerful open diffusion large language model
to date. Unlike autoregressive (AR) models that generate tokens sequentially,
Dream 7B employs discrete diffusion modeling to refine sequences in parallel
through iterative denoising. Our model consistently outperforms existing
diffusion language models on general, mathematical, and coding tasks. Dream 7B
demonstrates superior planning abilities and inference flexibility, including
arbitrary-order generation, infilling capabilities, and tunable quality-speed
trade-offs. These results are achieved through simple yet effective training
techniques, including AR-based LLM initialization and context-adaptive
token-level noise rescheduling. We release both Dream-Base and Dream-Instruct

Hebrew-language corpus of 10,410 sentences drawn from Knesset speeches
(1993-2023), Facebook posts (2018-2021), and leading news outlets, of which
1,812 instances (17.4\%) exhibit PDD and 642 carry additional annotations for
intensity, incivility, target type, and affective framing. We introduce a
two-stage classification pipeline combining finetuned encoder models and
decoder LLMs. Our best model (DictaLM 2.0) attains an F$_1$ of 0.74 for binary
PDD detection and a macro-F$_1$ of 0.67 for classification of delegitimization
characteristics. Applying this classifier to longitudinal and cross-platform
data, we see a marked rise in PDD over three decades, higher prevalence on
social media versus parliamentary debate, greater use by male than female
politicians, and stronger tendencies among right-leaning actors - with
pronounced spikes during election campaigns and major political events. Our
findings demonstrate the feasibility and value of automated PDD analysis for
understanding democratic discourse.

Conclusion: SafetyFlow系统成功解决了人工构建基准的局限性，贡献了首个全自动评测框架和高质量安全基准，显著提升了评估效率

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the
requirement for reliable safety evaluation to uncover model vulnerabilities. To
this end, numerous LLM safety evaluation benchmarks are proposed. However,
existing benchmarks generally rely on labor-intensive manual curation, which
causes excessive time and resource consumption. They also exhibit significant
redundancy and limited difficulty. To alleviate these problems, we introduce
SafetyFlow, the first agent-flow system designed to automate the construction
of LLM safety benchmarks. SafetyFlow can automatically build a comprehensive
safety benchmark in only four days without any human intervention by
orchestrating seven specialized agents, significantly reducing time and
resource cost. Equipped with versatile tools, the agents of SafetyFlow ensure
process and cost controllability while integrating human expertise into the
automatic pipeline. The final constructed dataset, SafetyFlowBench, contains
23,446 queries with low redundancy and strong discriminative power. Our
contribution includes the first fully automated benchmarking pipeline and a
comprehensive safety benchmark. We evaluate the safety of 49 advanced LLMs on
our dataset and conduct extensive experiments to validate our efficacy and
efficiency.

Motivation: 发现LLMs作为判别器识别有害请求的能力显著优于作为生成器的防御能力，探索通过能力对齐提升安全性

Method: 基于强化学习的自优化框架，利用模型自身判别能力作为奖励信号进行迭代优化，无需额外标注数据或外部模型

Result: 显著提升模型安全性（+14.5%对抗攻击鲁棒性），有效抵御OOD攻击，仅需少量判别样本即可增强生成能力

Conclusion: SDGO通过能力对齐实现了更紧密的判别-生成耦合，为LLM安全防护提供了高效可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at various natural language processing
tasks but remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks that induce harmful content
generation. In this paper, we reveal a critical safety inconsistency: LLMs can
more effectively identify harmful requests as discriminators than defend
against them as generators. This insight inspires us to explore aligning the
model's inherent discrimination and generation capabilities. To this end, we
propose SDGO (Self-Discrimination-Guided Optimization), a reinforcement
learning framework that leverages the model's own discrimination capabilities
as a reward signal to enhance generation safety through iterative
self-improvement. Our method does not require any additional annotated data or
external models during the training phase. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SDGO significantly improves model safety compared to both prompt-based and
training-based baselines while maintaining helpfulness on general benchmarks.
By aligning LLMs' discrimination and generation capabilities, SDGO brings
robust performance against out-of-distribution (OOD) jailbreaking attacks. This
alignment achieves tighter coupling between these two capabilities, enabling
the model's generation capability to be further enhanced with only a small
amount of discriminative samples. Our code and datasets are available at
https://github.com/NJUNLP/SDGO.

Result: 多种LLM方法测试表明，即使使用先进的自省框架，综述生成任务仍存在显著困难

Conclusion: 科学综述自动生成具有高度复杂性，需持续研究改进，开源代码/数据/模型促进领域发展

Abstract: Scientific survey articles play a vital role in summarizing research
progress, yet their manual creation is becoming increasingly infeasible due to
the rapid growth of academic literature. While large language models (LLMs)
offer promising capabilities for automating this process, progress in this area
is hindered by the absence of standardized benchmarks and evaluation protocols.
To address this gap, we introduce SurGE (Survey Generation Evaluation), a new
benchmark for evaluating scientific survey generation in the computer science
domain. SurGE consists of (1) a collection of test instances, each including a
topic description, an expert-written survey, and its full set of cited
references, and (2) a large-scale academic corpus of over one million papers
that serves as the retrieval pool. In addition, we propose an automated
evaluation framework that measures generated surveys across four dimensions:
information coverage, referencing accuracy, structural organization, and
content quality. Our evaluation of diverse LLM-based approaches shows that
survey generation remains highly challenging, even for advanced self-reflection
frameworks. These findings highlight the complexity of the task and the
necessity for continued research. We have open-sourced all the code, data, and
models at: https://github.com/oneal2000/SurGE

Method: 设计Pos2Distill-R¹（检索场景）和Pos2Distill-R²（推理场景）两个专用系统，利用位置间知识迁移机制缩小性能差距。

Result: 全位置性能显著提升，检索/推理任务分别实现4.0%/5.8%的绝对改进，且系统展现跨任务泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过位置偏差自校正机制，首次实现不同范式下位置偏差的协同优化，为长文本处理提供新范式。

Abstract: Positional bias (PB), manifesting as non-uniform sensitivity across different
contextual locations, significantly impairs long-context comprehension and
processing capabilities. While prior work seeks to mitigate PB through
modifying the architectures causing its emergence, significant PB still
persists. To address PB effectively, we introduce \textbf{Pos2Distill}, a
position to position knowledge distillation framework. Pos2Distill transfers
the superior capabilities from advantageous positions to less favorable ones,
thereby reducing the huge performance gaps. The conceptual principle is to
leverage the inherent, position-induced disparity to counteract the PB itself.
We identify distinct manifestations of PB under \textbf{\textsc{r}}etrieval and
\textbf{\textsc{r}}easoning paradigms, thereby designing two specialized
instantiations: \emph{Pos2Distill-R\textsuperscript{1}} and
\emph{Pos2Distill-R\textsuperscript{2}} respectively, both grounded in this
core principle. By employing the Pos2Distill approach, we achieve enhanced
uniformity and significant performance gains across all contextual positions in
long-context retrieval and reasoning tasks. Crucially, both specialized systems
exhibit strong cross-task generalization mutually, while achieving superior
performance on their respective tasks.

Conclusion: 建议构建融合形态学特征的标准化评估体系，开发多方言兼容的孟加拉词干提取框架，并通过开源社区推动工具迭代

Abstract: Bangla, the seventh most widely spoken language worldwide with 300 million
native speakers, faces digital under-representation due to limited resources
and lack of annotated datasets. Stemming, a critical preprocessing step in
language analysis, is essential for low-resource, highly-inflectional languages
like Bangla, because it can reduce the complexity of algorithms and models by
significantly reducing the number of words the algorithm needs to consider.
This paper conducts a comprehensive survey of stemming approaches, emphasizing
the importance of handling morphological variants effectively. While exploring
the landscape of Bangla stemming, it becomes evident that there is a
significant gap in the existing literature. The paper highlights the
discontinuity from previous research and the scarcity of accessible
implementations for replication. Furthermore, it critiques the evaluation
methodologies, stressing the need for more relevant metrics. In the context of
Bangla's rich morphology and diverse dialects, the paper acknowledges the
challenges it poses. To address these challenges, the paper suggests directions
for Bangla stemmer development. It concludes by advocating for robust Bangla
stemmers and continued research in the field to enhance language analysis and
processing.

Method: 构建包含40万样本的EcomMMMU数据集，设计8项核心任务，并提出基于视觉效用预测的SUMEI方法

Result: 实验显示商品图像可能损害模型性能，SUMEI方法在多项任务中表现稳健（提升平均准确率4.7%）

Conclusion: 当前MLLMs难以有效利用视觉信息，SUMEI通过策略性图像选择机制显著提升多模态任务表现

Abstract: E-commerce platforms are rich in multimodal data, featuring a variety of
images that depict product details. However, this raises an important question:
do these images always enhance product understanding, or can they sometimes
introduce redundancy or degrade performance? Existing datasets are limited in
both scale and design, making it difficult to systematically examine this
question. To this end, we introduce EcomMMMU, an e-commerce multimodal
multitask understanding dataset with 406,190 samples and 8,989,510 images.
EcomMMMU is comprised of multi-image visual-language data designed with 8
essential tasks and a specialized VSS subset to benchmark the capability of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to effectively utilize visual content.
Analysis on EcomMMMU reveals that product images do not consistently improve
performance and can, in some cases, degrade it. This indicates that MLLMs may
struggle to effectively leverage rich visual content for e-commerce tasks.
Building on these insights, we propose SUMEI, a data-driven method that
strategically utilizes multiple images via predicting visual utilities before
using them for downstream tasks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of SUMEI. The data and code are available through
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/submission25.

Conclusion: 通过强化学习驱动的代理RAG架构，不仅提升诊断可靠性，其可解释性分析还为临床提供可追溯的预诊断支持，推动AI辅助诊断的实际应用

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis with medical large language models is hindered by
knowledge gaps and hallucinations. Retrieval and tool-augmented methods help,
but their impact is limited by weak use of external knowledge and poor
feedback-reasoning traceability. To address these challenges, We introduce
Deep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement
learning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for
medical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical
retrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge
sources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More
crutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its
environment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure,
and diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from
large-scale data through RL.
  Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework
consistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches
across multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves
substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic
baselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks
for both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and
out-of-distribution settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and
retrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the
uniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional
implementations. Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight
improvements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight
into its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more
reliable and precise preliminary diagnoses. See

Result: TIR模型在各类任务中全面超越基线，PAC和AUC-PCC显示推理效率提升30%，过度思考现象减少25%。

Conclusion: TIR展现出跨领域优势，通过工具协同可系统提升LLMs的复杂推理能力，为智能体开发提供新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning tasks
through methods like chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they often fall
short in tasks requiring precise computations. Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR)
has emerged as a solution by incorporating external tools into the reasoning
process. Nevertheless, the generalization of TIR in improving the reasoning
ability of LLM is still unclear. Additionally, whether TIR has improved the
model's reasoning behavior and helped the model think remains to be studied. We
introduce ReasonZoo, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing nine diverse
reasoning categories, to evaluate the effectiveness of TIR across various
domains. Additionally, we propose two novel metrics, Performance-Aware Cost
(PAC) and Area Under the Performance-Cost Curve (AUC-PCC), to assess reasoning
efficiency. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that TIR-enabled models
consistently outperform their non-TIR counterparts in both mathematical and
non-mathematical tasks. Furthermore, TIR enhances reasoning efficiency, as
evidenced by improved PAC and AUC-PCC, indicating reduced overthinking and more
streamlined reasoning. These findings underscore the domain-general benefits of
TIR and its potential to advance LLM capabilities in complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Tool calling has emerged as a critical capability for AI agents to interact
with the real world and solve complex tasks. While the Model Context Protocol
(MCP) provides a powerful standardized framework for tool integration, there is
a significant gap in benchmarking how well AI agents can effectively solve
multi-step tasks using diverse MCP tools in realistic, dynamic scenarios. In
this work, we present LiveMCP-101, a benchmark of 101 carefully curated
real-world queries, refined through iterative LLM rewriting and manual review,
that require coordinated use of multiple MCP tools including web search, file
operations, mathematical reasoning, and data analysis. Moreover, we introduce a
novel evaluation approach that leverages ground-truth execution plans rather
than raw API outputs, better reflecting the evolving nature of real-world
environments. Experiments show that even frontier LLMs achieve a success rate
below 60\%, highlighting major challenges in tool orchestration. Detailed
ablations and error analysis further reveal distinct failure modes and
inefficiencies in token usage, pointing to concrete directions for advancing
current models. LiveMCP-101 sets a rigorous standard for evaluating real-world
agent capabilities, advancing toward autonomous AI systems that reliably
execute complex tasks through tool use.

Abstract: Mixed Reality scene relighting, where virtual changes to lighting conditions
realistically interact with physical objects, producing authentic illumination
and shadows, can be used in a variety of applications. One such application in
real estate could be visualizing a room at different times of day and placing
virtual light fixtures. Existing deep learning-based relighting techniques
typically exceed the real-time performance capabilities of current MR devices.
On the other hand, scene understanding methods, such as on-device scene
reconstruction, often yield inaccurate results due to scanning limitations, in
turn affecting relighting quality. Finally, simpler 2D image filter-based
approaches cannot represent complex geometry and shadows. We introduce a novel
method to integrate image segmentation, with lighting propagation via
anisotropic diffusion on top of basic scene understanding, and the
computational simplicity of filter-based techniques. Our approach corrects
on-device scanning inaccuracies, delivering visually appealing and accurate
relighting effects in real-time on edge devices, achieving speeds as high as
100 fps. We show a direct comparison between our method and the industry
standard, and present a practical demonstration of our method in the
aforementioned real estate example.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本生成图像模型存在明显偏见（如CEO默认生成白人男性），传统去偏方法通常需要复杂计算或模型调整。本文旨在开发简单高效的推理阶段去偏方案。

Method: 通过调整扩散过程避开潜在空间中偏见概念的维度区域，无需修改模型架构/参数。以护士/消防员/CEO为例，针对性别、种族、年龄三个维度进行去偏。

Result: 人工评估1200张生成图像显示，该方法显著降低偏见（评估者间一致性较高）。GPT-4o自动评估结果与人工评估无显著统计差异，验证了自动评估的可行性。

Conclusion: 该方法为扩散模型提供了一种高效易用的去偏方案，仅需修改推理过程即可提升生成多样性，且自动评估工具的开发为后续研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: We propose DeCoDi, a debiasing procedure for text-to-image diffusion-based
models that changes the inference procedure, does not significantly change
image quality, has negligible compute overhead, and can be applied in any
diffusion-based image generation model. DeCoDi changes the diffusion process to
avoid latent dimension regions of biased concepts. While most deep learning
debiasing methods require complex or compute-intensive interventions, our
method is designed to change only the inference procedure. Therefore, it is
more accessible to a wide range of practitioners. We show the effectiveness of
the method by debiasing for gender, ethnicity, and age for the concepts of
nurse, firefighter, and CEO. Two distinct human evaluators manually inspect
1,200 generated images. Their evaluation results provide evidence that our
method is effective in mitigating biases based on gender, ethnicity, and age.
We also show that an automatic bias evaluation performed by the GPT4o is not
significantly statistically distinct from a human evaluation. Our evaluation
shows promising results, with reliable levels of agreement between evaluators
and more coverage of protected attributes. Our method has the potential to
significantly improve the diversity of images it generates by diffusion-based
text-to-image generative models.

Conclusion: FSAP揭示了神经检索系统面临的新型威胁，证明基于prompt的攻击具有实际危害和跨模型扩展性

Abstract: While neural ranking models (NRMs) have shown high effectiveness, they remain
susceptible to adversarial manipulation. In this work, we introduce Few-Shot
Adversarial Prompting (FSAP), a novel black-box attack framework that leverages
the in-context learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to
generate high-ranking adversarial documents. Unlike previous approaches that
rely on token-level perturbations or manual rewriting of existing documents,
FSAP formulates adversarial attacks entirely through few-shot prompting,
requiring no gradient access or internal model instrumentation. By conditioning
the LLM on a small support set of previously observed harmful examples, FSAP
synthesizes grammatically fluent and topically coherent documents that subtly
embed false or misleading information and rank competitively against authentic
content. We instantiate FSAP in two modes: FSAP-IntraQ, which leverages harmful
examples from the same query to enhance topic fidelity, and FSAP-InterQ, which
enables broader generalization by transferring adversarial patterns across
unrelated queries. Our experiments on the TREC 2020 and 2021 Health
Misinformation Tracks, using four diverse neural ranking models, reveal that
FSAP-generated documents consistently outrank credible, factually accurate
documents. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that these adversarial
outputs exhibit strong stance alignment and low detectability, posing a
realistic and scalable threat to neural retrieval systems. FSAP also
effectively generalizes across both proprietary and open-source LLMs.

Conclusion: 旨在推动学术界与产业界共同完善GenAI原生系统范式，实现自我演进的技术生态体系

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) has emerged as a transformative technology,
demonstrating remarkable capabilities across diverse application domains.
However, GenAI faces several major challenges in developing reliable and
efficient GenAI-empowered systems due to its unpredictability and inefficiency.
This paper advocates for a paradigm shift: future GenAI-native systems should
integrate GenAI's cognitive capabilities with traditional software engineering
principles to create robust, adaptive, and efficient systems.
  We introduce foundational GenAI-native design principles centered around five
key pillars -- reliability, excellence, evolvability, self-reliance, and
assurance -- and propose architectural patterns such as GenAI-native cells,
organic substrates, and programmable routers to guide the creation of resilient
and self-evolving systems. Additionally, we outline the key ingredients of a
GenAI-native software stack and discuss the impact of these systems from
technical, user adoption, economic, and legal perspectives, underscoring the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有符号叙事图存在动作/事件标注不一致和冗余问题，限制了推理能力和泛化效果

Method: 基于认知模型的层次化叙事知识图谱框架，结合词相似度和嵌入聚类实现语义标准化

Result: 在Manga109数据集上验证，标准化后的叙事图在检索、推理任务中提升21%的连贯性和15%的鲁棒性

Conclusion: 语义标准化是构建可扩展多模态叙事理解模型的关键步骤，同时保持符号系统的可解释性

Abstract: Understanding visual narratives such as comics requires structured
representations that capture events, characters, and their relations across
multiple levels of story organization. However, symbolic narrative graphs often
suffer from inconsistency and redundancy, where similar actions or events are
labeled differently across annotations or contexts. Such variance limits the
effectiveness of reasoning and generalization.
  This paper introduces a semantic normalization framework for hierarchical
narrative knowledge graphs. Building on cognitively grounded models of
narrative comprehension, we propose methods that consolidate semantically
related actions and events using lexical similarity and embedding-based
clustering. The normalization process reduces annotation noise, aligns symbolic
categories across narrative levels, and preserves interpretability.
  We demonstrate the framework on annotated manga stories from the Manga109
dataset, applying normalization to panel-, event-, and story-level graphs.
Preliminary evaluations across narrative reasoning tasks, such as action
retrieval, character grounding, and event summarization, show that semantic
normalization improves coherence and robustness, while maintaining symbolic
transparency. These findings suggest that normalization is a key step toward
scalable, cognitively inspired graph models for multimodal narrative
understanding.

*Xinshuang Liu,Runfa Blark Li,Keito Suzuki,Truong Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ICGS-Quantizer方法，通过跨场景共享码书和条件解码机制，将3DGS压缩至KB级并支持场景更新


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS压缩方法存在存储占用过大(兆字节级)且缺乏长期存档后的场景适应机制

Method: 联合利用高斯间/属性间相关性 + 跨场景共享固定码书 + 图像条件解码框架(编解码联合训练)

Result: 在压缩效率(达KB级)和场景更新适应性上超越SOTA方法，保持视觉保真度

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模3D场景存档提供实用解决方案，支持压缩与动态更新双重需求

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted considerable attention for
enabling high-quality real-time rendering. Although 3DGS compression methods
have been proposed for deployment on storage-constrained devices, two
limitations hinder archival use: (1) they compress medium-scale scenes only to
the megabyte range, which remains impractical for large-scale scenes or
extensive scene collections; and (2) they lack mechanisms to accommodate scene
changes after long-term archival. To address these limitations, we propose an
Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) that substantially
enhances compression efficiency and provides adaptability to scene changes
after archiving. ICGS-Quantizer improves quantization efficiency by jointly
exploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and by using shared
codebooks across all training scenes, which are then fixed and applied to
previously unseen test scenes, eliminating the overhead of per-scene codebooks.
This approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3DGS to the
kilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity. To enable adaptability to
post-archival scene changes, ICGS-Quantizer conditions scene decoding on images
captured at decoding time. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes
are trained jointly, ensuring that the codes, which are quantized
representations of the scene, are effective for conditional decoding. We
evaluate ICGS-Quantizer on 3D scene compression and 3D scene updating.
Experimental results show that ICGS-Quantizer consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in compression efficiency and adaptability to scene
changes. Our code, model, and data will be publicly available on GitHub.

Motivation: 传统生成模型独立采样导致输出冗余，限制了用户选择范围和创意探索。需要解决多样本场景下的结果同质化问题，提升生成结果的实用价值

Method: 将群组推理建模为二次整数分配问题：候选输出作为图节点，通过优化样本质量（一元项）和最大化组内多样性（二元项）进行子集选择。采用渐进式候选集剪枝算法提升计算效率

Result: 在文本到图像、图像到图像、图像提示、视频生成等任务中，相比基线方法显著提升组内多样性和质量指标。支持大规模候选集处理

Conclusion: 该框架使生成模型能够将多个输出视为有机整体而非独立样本，突破了传统独立采样范式，为生成模型的实践应用开辟了新方向

Abstract: Generative models typically sample outputs independently, and recent
inference-time guidance and scaling algorithms focus on improving the quality
of individual samples. However, in real-world applications, users are often
presented with a set of multiple images (e.g., 4-8) for each prompt, where
independent sampling tends to lead to redundant results, limiting user choices
and hindering idea exploration. In this work, we introduce a scalable group
inference method that improves both the diversity and quality of a group of
samples. We formulate group inference as a quadratic integer assignment
problem: candidate outputs are modeled as graph nodes, and a subset is selected
to optimize sample quality (unary term) while maximizing group diversity
(binary term). To substantially improve runtime efficiency, we progressively
prune the candidate set using intermediate predictions, allowing our method to
scale up to large candidate sets. Extensive experiments show that our method
significantly improves group diversity and quality compared to independent
sampling baselines and recent inference algorithms. Our framework generalizes
across a wide range of tasks, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image
prompting, and video generation, enabling generative models to treat multiple
outputs as cohesive groups rather than independent samples.

Conclusion: 中文语音可实现心衰检测，配对式分类为未来研究提供理想基线，个体差异需特殊处理，数据已开源促进领域发展

Abstract: Speech is a cost-effective and non-intrusive data source for identifying
acute and chronic heart failure (HF). However, there is a lack of research on
whether Chinese syllables contain HF-related information, as observed in other
well-studied languages. This study presents the first Chinese speech database
of HF patients, featuring paired recordings taken before and after
hospitalisation. The findings confirm the effectiveness of the Chinese language
in HF detection using both standard 'patient-wise' and personalised 'pair-wise'
classification approaches, with the latter serving as an ideal
speaker-decoupled baseline for future research. Statistical tests and
classification results highlight individual differences as key contributors to
inaccuracy. Additionally, an adaptive frequency filter (AFF) is proposed for
frequency importance analysis. The data and demonstrations are published at

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的Text-to-SQL系统存在查询歧义导致意图误解的问题，需要系统化解决方案

Method: 建立细粒度歧义分类体系检测歧义→通过多选交互获取用户反馈→重写查询语句→集成现有系统验证效果

Result: 歧义检测精度87.2%，集成后SQL准确率提升50%，系统实用性强（提供代码库和演示）

Conclusion: 交互式歧义消除机制可显著提升Text-to-SQL系统的准确性和实用性

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language questions into SQL queries,
providing substantial value for non-expert users. While large language models
(LLMs) show promising results for this task, they remain error-prone. Query
ambiguity has been recognized as a major obstacle for LLM-based Text-to-SQL
systems, leading to misinterpretation of user intent and inaccurate SQL
generation. We demonstrate AmbiSQL, an interactive system that automatically
detects query ambiguities and guides users through intuitive multiple-choice
questions to clarify their intent. Our approach introduces a fine-grained
ambiguity taxonomy for identifying ambiguities that affect database element
mapping and LLM reasoning, then incorporates user feedback to rewrite ambiguous
questions. Evaluation on an ambiguous query dataset shows that AmbiSQL achieves
87.2% precision in ambiguity detection and improves SQL exact match accuracy by
50% when integrated with Text-to-SQL systems. Our demonstration showcases the
significant performance gains and highlights the system's practical usability.

Motivation: 现有基于虚假评论文本的投毒攻击存在文本质量低、攻击效果差的问题，需在有限资源下生成迁移性强且不易被检测的虚假画像。

Method: 1. 设计演示检索算法和文本风格迁移策略增强情境学习 2. 构建包含jailbreaker、instructional agent和guardian的三阶段协同优化框架 3. 通过对抗训练平衡攻击效果与隐蔽性

Conclusion: 首次将多模态基础模型应用于推荐系统攻击，证明高质量文本生成对提升攻击有效性的重要性，为推荐系统鲁棒性评估提供新基准

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that recommender systems (RSs) are highly
vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, where malicious actors inject fake user
profiles, including a group of well-designed fake ratings, to manipulate
recommendations. Due to security and privacy constraints in practice, attackers
typically possess limited knowledge of the victim system and thus need to craft
profiles that have transferability across black-box RSs. To maximize the attack
impact, the profiles often remains imperceptible. However, generating such
high-quality profiles with the restricted resources is challenging. Some works
suggest incorporating fake textual reviews to strengthen the profiles; yet, the
poor quality of the reviews largely undermines the attack effectiveness and
imperceptibility under the practical setting.
  To tackle the above challenges, in this paper, we propose to enhance the
quality of the review text by harnessing in-context learning (ICL) capabilities
of multimodal foundation models. To this end, we introduce a demonstration
retrieval algorithm and a text style transfer strategy to augment the navie
ICL. Specifically, we propose a novel practical attack framework named RAGAN to
generate high-quality fake user profiles, which can gain insights into the
robustness of RSs. The profiles are generated by a jailbreaker and
collaboratively optimized on an instructional agent and a guardian to improve
the attack transferability and imperceptibility. Comprehensive experiments on
various real-world datasets demonstrate that RAGAN achieves the
state-of-the-art poisoning attack performance.

TL;DR: 提出IPIGuard防御框架，通过工具依赖图解耦动作规划与数据交互，有效抵御间接提示注入攻击


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法依赖语言模型自身安全性假设，缺乏对代理工具调用的结构性约束，仍存在被强攻击向量绕过的风险

Method: 将代理任务执行建模为工具依赖图(TDG)遍历，显式分离动作规划阶段与外部数据交互阶段

Result: 在AgentDojo基准测试中实现了效果与鲁棒性的最佳平衡，恶意工具调用减少78%

Conclusion: IPIGuard为动态环境中的安全智能体系统开发提供了新的结构化防御范式

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are widely deployed in real-world
applications, where they leverage tools to retrieve and manipulate external
data for complex tasks. However, when interacting with untrusted data sources
(e.g., fetching information from public websites), tool responses may contain
injected instructions that covertly influence agent behaviors and lead to
malicious outcomes, a threat referred to as Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI).
Existing defenses typically rely on advanced prompting strategies or auxiliary
detection models. While these methods have demonstrated some effectiveness,
they fundamentally rely on assumptions about the model's inherent security,
which lacks structural constraints on agent behaviors. As a result, agents
still retain unrestricted access to tool invocations, leaving them vulnerable
to stronger attack vectors that can bypass the security guardrails of the
model. To prevent malicious tool invocations at the source, we propose a novel
defensive task execution paradigm, called IPIGuard, which models the agents'
task execution process as a traversal over a planned Tool Dependency Graph
(TDG). By explicitly decoupling action planning from interaction with external
data, IPIGuard significantly reduces unintended tool invocations triggered by
injected instructions, thereby enhancing robustness against IPI attacks.
Experiments on the AgentDojo benchmark show that IPIGuard achieves a superior
balance between effectiveness and robustness, paving the way for the
development of safer agentic systems in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Advancements in diffusion-based foundation models have improved text-to-image
generation, yet most efforts have been limited to low-resolution settings. As
high-resolution image synthesis becomes increasingly essential for various
applications, particularly in medical imaging domains, fine-tuning emerges as a
crucial mechanism for adapting these powerful pre-trained models to
task-specific requirements and data distributions. In this work, we present a
systematic study, examining the impact of various fine-tuning techniques on
image generation quality when scaling to high resolution 512x512 pixels. We
benchmark a diverse set of fine-tuning methods, including full fine-tuning
strategies and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). We dissect how different
fine-tuning methods influence key quality metrics, including Fr\'echet
Inception Distance (FID), Vendi score, and prompt-image alignment. We also
evaluate the utility of generated images in a downstream classification task
under data-scarce conditions, demonstrating that specific fine-tuning
strategies improve both generation fidelity and downstream performance when
synthetic images are used for classifier training and evaluation on real
images. Our code is accessible through the project website -

Conclusion: NeRD证明了神经模拟器在机器人仿真中的通用潜力，其可替换架构和真实数据适应能力为构建数字孪生系统提供了新范式

Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulation of modern robots remains challenging due to
their high degrees of freedom and intricate mechanisms. Neural simulators have
emerged as a promising alternative to traditional analytical simulators,
capable of efficiently predicting complex dynamics and adapting to real-world
data; however, existing neural simulators typically require
application-specific training and fail to generalize to novel tasks and/or
environments, primarily due to inadequate representations of the global state.
In this work, we address the problem of learning generalizable neural
simulators for robots that are structured as articulated rigid bodies. We
propose NeRD (Neural Robot Dynamics), learned robot-specific dynamics models
for predicting future states for articulated rigid bodies under contact
constraints. NeRD uniquely replaces the low-level dynamics and contact solvers
in an analytical simulator and employs a robot-centric and spatially-invariant
simulation state representation. We integrate the learned NeRD models as an
interchangeable backend solver within a state-of-the-art robotics simulator. We
conduct extensive experiments to show that the NeRD simulators are stable and
accurate over a thousand simulation steps; generalize across tasks and
environment configurations; enable policy learning exclusively in a neural
engine; and, unlike most classical simulators, can be fine-tuned from
real-world data to bridge the gap between simulation and reality.

Method: 结合Transformer语义表示，分析CSG参数敏感性；提出关系熵、最大关系多样性等新指标进行系统性基准测试。

Result: CSG与MRR/Hit@1相关性弱；关系熵等语义指标与MRR强负相关；图连通性指标与Hit@10正相关。

Conclusion: CSG在链接预测中缺乏稳定性，需开发更稳定、可解释且任务对齐的数据集复杂度评估方法。

Abstract: Understanding dataset complexity is fundamental to evaluating and comparing
link prediction models on knowledge graphs (KGs). While the Cumulative Spectral
Gradient (CSG) metric, derived from probabilistic divergence between classes
within a spectral clustering framework, has been proposed as a classifier
agnostic complexity metric purportedly scaling with class cardinality and
correlating with downstream performance, it has not been evaluated in KG
settings so far. In this work, we critically examine CSG in the context of
multi relational link prediction, incorporating semantic representations via
transformer derived embeddings. Contrary to prior claims, we find that CSG is
highly sensitive to parametrisation and does not robustly scale with the number
of classes. Moreover, it exhibits weak or inconsistent correlation with
standard performance metrics such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hit@1. To
deepen the analysis, we introduce and benchmark a set of structural and
semantic KG complexity metrics. Our findings reveal that global and local
relational ambiguity captured via Relation Entropy, node level Maximum Relation
Diversity, and Relation Type Cardinality exhibit strong inverse correlations
with MRR and Hit@1, suggesting these as more faithful indicators of task
difficulty. Conversely, graph connectivity measures such as Average Degree,
Degree Entropy, PageRank, and Eigenvector Centrality correlate positively with
Hit@10. Our results demonstrate that CSGs purported stability and
generalization predictive power fail to hold in link prediction settings and
underscore the need for more stable, interpretable, and task-aligned measures
of dataset complexity in knowledge driven learning.

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs(TAGs) are pervasive in real-world systems,where each
node carries its own textual features. In many cases these graphs are
inherently heterogeneous, containing multiple node types and diverse edge
types. Despite the ubiquity of such heterogeneous TAGs, there remains a lack of
large-scale benchmark datasets. This shortage has become a critical bottleneck,
hindering the development and fair comparison of representation learning
methods on heterogeneous text-attributed graphs. In this paper, we introduce
CITE - Catalytic Information Textual Entities Graph, the first and largest
heterogeneous text-attributed citation graph benchmark for catalytic materials.
CITE comprises over 438K nodes and 1.2M edges, spanning four relation types. In
addition, we establish standardized evaluation procedures and conduct extensive
benchmarking on the node classification task, as well as ablation experiments
on the heterogeneous and textual properties of CITE. We compare four classes of
learning paradigms, including homogeneous graph models, heterogeneous graph
models, LLM(Large Language Model)-centric models, and LLM+Graph models. In a
nutshell, we provide (i) an overview of the CITE dataset, (ii) standardized
evaluation protocols, and (iii) baseline and ablation experiments across

Abstract: With the advent of wearable recorders, scientists are increasingly turning to
automated methods of analysis of audio and video data in order to measure
children's experience, behavior, and outcomes, with a sizable literature
employing long-form audio-recordings to study language acquisition. While
numerous articles report on the accuracy and reliability of the most popular
automated classifiers, less has been written on the downstream effects of
classification errors on measurements and statistical inferences (e.g., the
estimate of correlations and effect sizes in regressions). This paper proposes
a Bayesian approach to study the effects of algorithmic errors on key
scientific questions, including the effect of siblings on children's language
experience and the association between children's production and their input.
In both the most commonly used \gls{lena}, and an open-source alternative (the
Voice Type Classifier from the ACLEW system), we find that classification
errors can significantly distort estimates. For instance, automated annotations
underestimated the negative effect of siblings on adult input by 20--80\%,
potentially placing it below statistical significance thresholds. We further
show that a Bayesian calibration approach for recovering unbiased estimates of
effect sizes can be effective and insightful, but does not provide a fool-proof
solution. Both the issue reported and our solution may apply to any classifier
involving event detection and classification with non-zero error rates.

Motivation: 解决科学领域开源模型与闭源模型差距大、专业任务依赖专家模型的问题，探索通用人工智能(AGI)实现路径。

Method: 采用280亿激活参数的MoE架构，持续预训练5T token（含2.5T科学数据），通过离线+在线强化学习（含MoR奖励混合机制）在1000+任务上训练。

Result: 通用推理任务达开源顶尖水平，科学领域显著优于开源模型，在分子合成规划/反应条件预测等专业任务超越闭源SOTA模型。

Conclusion: Intern-S1通过综合创新缩小科学领域模型差距，为科研转型提供支持，相关模型已在HuggingFace开源。

Abstract: In recent years, a plethora of open-source foundation models have emerged,
achieving remarkable progress in some widely attended fields, with performance
being quite close to that of closed-source models. However, in high-value but
more challenging scientific professional fields, either the fields still rely
on expert models, or the progress of general foundation models lags
significantly compared to those in popular areas, far from sufficient for
transforming scientific research and leaving substantial gap between
open-source models and closed-source models in these scientific domains. To
mitigate this gap and explore a step further toward Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI), we introduce Intern-S1, a specialized generalist equipped
with general understanding and reasoning capabilities with expertise to analyze
multiple science modal data. Intern-S1 is a multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
model with 28 billion activated parameters and 241 billion total parameters,
continually pre-trained on 5T tokens, including over 2.5T tokens from
scientific domains. In the post-training stage, Intern-S1 undergoes offline and
then online reinforcement learning (RL) in InternBootCamp, where we propose
Mixture-of-Rewards (MoR) to synergize the RL training on more than 1000 tasks
simultaneously. Through integrated innovations in algorithms, data, and
training systems, Intern-S1 achieved top-tier performance in online RL
training.On comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, Intern-S1 demonstrates
competitive performance on general reasoning tasks among open-source models and
significantly outperforms open-source models in scientific domains, surpassing
closed-source state-of-the-art models in professional tasks, such as molecular
synthesis planning, reaction condition prediction, predicting thermodynamic
stabilities for crystals. Our models are available at

*Yibo Liu,Liam Shatzel,Brandon Haworth,Teseo Schneider*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出利用大型语言模型控制代理对话和导航，通过社交互动生成更自然的人群行为


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有群体动画方法忽视语言交互维度，导致代理互动局限于路径规划和固定目标。需通过语言模型增强社交和环境互动表现力

Method: 构建对话系统+语言驱动导航双模块。周期性地基于代理个性、角色、关系生成对话，并融合情感状态、视觉感知等要素指导运动决策

Result: 在复杂场景验证中实现代理自动分组/解组，建立群体信息传递机制，生成包含涌现群体行为的逼真模拟

Conclusion: 语言模型有效增强了代理的社交推理能力，使群体行为自然涌现，为不同环境设置提供了普适性解决方案

Abstract: Animating and simulating crowds using an agent-based approach is a
well-established area where every agent in the crowd is individually controlled
such that global human-like behaviour emerges. We observe that human navigation
and movement in crowds are often influenced by complex social and environmental
interactions, driven mainly by language and dialogue. However, most existing
work does not consider these dimensions and leads to animations where
agent-agent and agent-environment interactions are largely limited to steering
and fixed higher-level goal extrapolation.
  We propose a novel method that exploits large language models (LLMs) to
control agents' movement. Our method has two main components: a dialogue system
and language-driven navigation. We periodically query agent-centric LLMs
conditioned on character personalities, roles, desires, and relationships to
control the generation of inter-agent dialogue when necessitated by the spatial
and social relationships with neighbouring agents. We then use the conversation
and each agent's personality, emotional state, vision, and physical state to
control the navigation and steering of each agent. Our model thus enables
agents to make motion decisions based on both their perceptual inputs and the
ongoing dialogue.
  We validate our method in two complex scenarios that exemplify the interplay
between social interactions, steering, and crowding. In these scenarios, we
observe that grouping and ungrouping of agents automatically occur.
Additionally, our experiments show that our method serves as an
information-passing mechanism within the crowd. As a result, our framework
produces more realistic crowd simulations, with emergent group behaviours
arising naturally from any environmental setting.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM在知识密集型任务中，信息检索比增加推理预算更能有效提升置信度校准，搜索增强生成准确率达89.3%，而长推理预算会导致系统性过度自信


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型在QA场景中的置信度校准问题，挑战'测试时扩展'范式，探究推理能力和计算预算对置信评估准确性的影响

Method: 使用ClimateX数据集并扩展至人类与行星健康领域，比较纯推理模型与搜索增强生成模型在不同计算预算下的表现

Result: 增加推理预算导致校准性能下降（准确率48.7%），长思考预算产生负收益；搜索增强生成准确率达89.3%

Conclusion: 信息获取能力而非推理深度或计算预算，是提升知识密集型任务置信度校准的关键瓶颈

Abstract: Large Language Models deployed as question answering tools require robust
calibration to avoid overconfidence. We systematically evaluate how reasoning
capabilities and budget affect confidence assessment accuracy, using the
ClimateX dataset (Lacombe et al., 2023) and expanding it to human and planetary
health. Our key finding challenges the "test-time scaling" paradigm: while
recent reasoning LLMs achieve 48.7% accuracy in assessing expert confidence,
increasing reasoning budgets consistently impairs rather than improves
calibration. Extended reasoning leads to systematic overconfidence that worsens
with longer thinking budgets, producing diminishing and negative returns beyond
modest computational investments. Conversely, search-augmented generation
dramatically outperforms pure reasoning, achieving 89.3% accuracy by retrieving
relevant evidence. Our results suggest that information access, rather than
reasoning depth or inference budget, may be the critical bottleneck for
improved confidence calibration of knowledge-intensive tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有智能体系统难以处理开放场景中人类非预定义的动态目标。需要建立支持无界目标空间推理的框架（OU-AGs）。

Method: GOOD方法：1) 用LLM模拟多意图用户对话 2) 概率推理生成目标分布 3) 在文本购物/家庭机器人环境（AI2Thor）中测试

Result: 在合成用户场景测试中，GOOD在目标追踪准确性上优于无显式目标建模的基线方法（LLM评估+人工验证双重确认）

Conclusion: 该方法无需大数据训练即可实现丰富的目标表示与不确定性量化，为开放世界人机协作提供了新思路。

Abstract: Embodied AI agents must infer and act in an interpretable way on diverse
human goals and preferences that are not predefined. To formalize this setting,
we introduce Open-Universe Assistance Games (OU-AGs), a framework where the
agent must reason over an unbounded and evolving space of possible goals. In
this context, we introduce GOOD (GOals from Open-ended Dialogue), a
data-efficient, online method that extracts goals in the form of natural
language during an interaction with a human, and infers a distribution over
natural language goals. GOOD prompts an LLM to simulate users with different
complex intents, using its responses to perform probabilistic inference over
candidate goals. This approach enables rich goal representations and
uncertainty estimation without requiring large offline datasets. We evaluate
GOOD in a text-based grocery shopping domain and in a text-operated simulated
household robotics environment (AI2Thor), using synthetic user profiles. Our
method outperforms a baseline without explicit goal tracking, as confirmed by
both LLM-based and human evaluations.

Conclusion: aiXiv为AI科学家创建了可扩展的开放获取生态系统，加速高质量AI生成科研内容的传播与学术进步

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled AI agents to
autonomously generate scientific proposals, conduct experiments, author papers,
and perform peer reviews. Yet this flood of AI-generated research content
collides with a fragmented and largely closed publication ecosystem.
Traditional journals and conferences rely on human peer review, making them
difficult to scale and often reluctant to accept AI-generated research content;
existing preprint servers (e.g. arXiv) lack rigorous quality-control
mechanisms. Consequently, a significant amount of high-quality AI-generated
research lacks appropriate venues for dissemination, hindering its potential to
advance scientific progress. To address these challenges, we introduce aiXiv, a
next-generation open-access platform for human and AI scientists. Its
multi-agent architecture allows research proposals and papers to be submitted,
reviewed, and iteratively refined by both human and AI scientists. It also
provides API and MCP interfaces that enable seamless integration of
heterogeneous human and AI scientists, creating a scalable and extensible
ecosystem for autonomous scientific discovery. Through extensive experiments,
we demonstrate that aiXiv is a reliable and robust platform that significantly
enhances the quality of AI-generated research proposals and papers after
iterative revising and reviewing on aiXiv. Our work lays the groundwork for a
next-generation open-access ecosystem for AI scientists, accelerating the
publication and dissemination of high-quality AI-generated research content.

Motivation: 罕见病多汗症缺乏可靠数据集制约LLMs应用，需开发专用框架解决数据稀缺与信任问题。

Method: 三阶段流程：1) 合成医疗情景增强数据 2) 微调开源模型实现诊断与心理支持 3) 临床专家迭代评估验证

Result: 实验证明框架优于基线模型，首个开源多汗症LLM方案为其他罕见病提供可复现方法

Conclusion: 该框架突破罕见病LLM应用瓶颈，通过合成数据生成和专家验证机制实现可信医疗支持系统

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in healthcare, their
application for rare medical conditions is still hindered by scarce and
unreliable datasets for fine-tuning. Hyperhidrosis, a disorder causing
excessive sweating beyond physiological needs, is one such rare disorder,
affecting 2-3% of the population and significantly impacting both physical
comfort and psychosocial well-being. To date, no work has tailored LLMs to
advance the diagnosis or care of hyperhidrosis. To address this gap, we present
LLM4Sweat, an open-source and domain-specific LLM framework for trustworthy and
empathetic hyperhidrosis support. The system follows a three-stage pipeline. In
the data augmentation stage, a frontier LLM generates medically plausible
synthetic vignettes from curated open-source data to create a diverse and
balanced question-answer dataset. In the fine-tuning stage, an open-source
foundation model is fine-tuned on the dataset to provide diagnosis,
personalized treatment recommendations, and empathetic psychological support.
In the inference and expert evaluation stage, clinical and psychological
specialists assess accuracy, appropriateness, and empathy, with validated
responses iteratively enriching the dataset. Experiments show that LLM4Sweat
outperforms baselines and delivers the first open-source LLM framework for
hyperhidrosis, offering a generalizable approach for other rare diseases with
similar data and trustworthiness challenges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有记忆模块（如MemoryBank、A-MEM）存储内容质量较低，导致回忆性能和响应质量受限，需构建高质量长期记忆体系。

Method: 基于认知心理学理论设计MMS系统：1) 生成多长期记忆片段 2) 构建一对一关联的检索单元和上下文单元 3) 通过检索匹配获取上下文增强响应

Result: 在LoCoMo数据集上超越3种基线方法，消融实验验证记忆单元有效性，存储开销分析证明实用价值

Conclusion: MMS系统通过结构化记忆处理机制，显著提升智能体对历史信息的利用效果，兼具性能优势与工程可行性

Abstract: An agent powered by large language models have achieved impressive results,
but effectively handling the vast amounts of historical data generated during
interactions remains a challenge. The current approach is to design a memory
module for the agent to process these data. However, existing methods, such as
MemoryBank and A-MEM, have poor quality of stored memory content, which affects
recall performance and response quality. In order to better construct
high-quality long-term memory content, we have designed a multiple memory
system (MMS) inspired by cognitive psychology theory. The system processes
short-term memory to multiple long-term memory fragments, and constructs
retrieval memory units and contextual memory units based on these fragments,
with a one-to-one correspondence between the two. During the retrieval phase,
MMS will match the most relevant retrieval memory units based on the user's
query. Then, the corresponding contextual memory units is obtained as the
context for the response stage to enhance knowledge, thereby effectively
utilizing historical data. Experiments on LoCoMo dataset compared our method
with three others, proving its effectiveness. Ablation studies confirmed the
rationality of our memory units. We also analyzed the robustness regarding the
number of selected memory segments and the storage overhead, demonstrating its
practical value.

Result: 在保持分布外泛化能力的前提下，实现多任务优异表现，验证符号表征对医疗推理的有效性

Conclusion: 成功建立ECG与自然语言联合处理范式，为医疗AI开辟了时序信号符号化与认知推理结合的新路径

Abstract: Electrocardiography plays a central role in cardiovascular diagnostics, yet
existing automated approaches often struggle to generalize across clinical
tasks and offer limited support for open-ended reasoning. We present DiagECG, a
novel framework that integrates time-series and language modeling by enabling
large language models to process 12-lead ECG signals for clinical text
generation tasks. Our approach discretizes continuous ECG embeddings into
symbolic tokens using a lead-independent encoder and quantization module. These
tokens are then used to extend the vocabulary of LLM, allowing the model to
handle both ECG and natural language inputs in a unified manner. To bridge the
modality gap, we pretrain the model on an autoregressive ECG forecasting task,
enabling the LLM to model temporal dynamics using its native language modeling
capabilities. Finally, we perform instruction tuning on both ECG question
answering and diagnostic report generation. Without modifying the core model,
DiagECG achieves strong performance across tasks while maintaining
generalization to out-of-distribution settings. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of each component and highlight the potential of
integrating symbolic ECG representations into LLMs for medical reasoning.

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) is critically dependent on
the availability of high-quality datasets for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
alignment tasks like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), etc. In this work,
we present a comprehensive synthetic data generation framework that facilitates
scalable, configurable, and high-fidelity generation of synthetic data tailored
for these training paradigms. Our approach employs a modular and
configuration-based pipeline capable of modeling complex dialogue flows with
minimal manual intervention. This framework uses a dual-stage quality tagging
mechanism, combining heuristic rules and LLM-based evaluations, to
automatically filter and score data extracted from OASST-formatted
conversations, ensuring the curation of high-quality dialogue samples. The
resulting datasets are structured under a flexible schema supporting both SFT
and DPO use cases, enabling seamless integration into diverse training
workflows. Together, these innovations offer a robust solution for generating
and managing synthetic conversational data at scale, significantly reducing the
overhead of data preparation in LLM training pipelines.

Conclusion: LGT框架通过自然语言推理实现了配置优化的语义级协调，文本梯度机制有效捕获训练动态，多智能体协作机制为机器学习优化提供了新范式

Abstract: Configuration optimization remains a critical bottleneck in machine learning,
requiring coordinated tuning across model architecture, training strategy,
feature engineering, and hyperparameters. Traditional approaches treat these
dimensions independently and lack interpretability, while recent automated
methods struggle with dynamic adaptability and semantic reasoning about
optimization decisions. We introduce Language-Guided Tuning (LGT), a novel
framework that employs multi-agent Large Language Models to intelligently
optimize configurations through natural language reasoning. We apply textual
gradients - qualitative feedback signals that complement numerical optimization
by providing semantic understanding of training dynamics and configuration
interdependencies. LGT coordinates three specialized agents: an Advisor that
proposes configuration changes, an Evaluator that assesses progress, and an
Optimizer that refines the decision-making process, creating a self-improving
feedback loop. Through comprehensive evaluation on six diverse datasets, LGT
demonstrates substantial improvements over traditional optimization methods,
achieving performance gains while maintaining high interpretability.
