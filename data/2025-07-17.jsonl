Manuscript submitted for review to the Journal of\n  Computational Literary Studies (JCLS)", "summary": "This study positions large language models (LLMs) as \"subjective literary\ncritics\" to explore aesthetic preferences and evaluation patterns in literary\nassessment. Ten Japanese science fiction short stories were translated into\nEnglish and evaluated by six state-of-the-art LLMs across seven independent\nsessions. Principal component analysis and clustering techniques revealed\nsignificant variations in evaluation consistency ({\\alpha} ranging from 1.00 to\n0.35) and five distinct evaluation patterns. Additionally, evaluation variance\nacross stories differed by up to 4.5-fold, with TF-IDF analysis confirming\ndistinctive evaluation vocabularies for each model. Our seven-session\nwithin-day protocol using an original Science Fiction corpus strategically\nminimizes external biases, allowing us to observe implicit value systems shaped\nby RLHF and their influence on literary judgment. These findings suggest that\nLLMs may possess individual evaluation characteristics similar to human\ncritical schools, rather than functioning as neutral benchmarkers."}

As of yet, these models typically overlook the impact of\nspatial features encoded in spatial audio signals on human motion. To bridge\nthis gap and enable high-quality modeling of human movements in response to\nspatial audio, we introduce the first comprehensive Spatial Audio-Driven Human\nMotion (SAM) dataset, which contains diverse and high-quality spatial audio and\nmotion data.

While meshes offer high precision, their\ndense vertex data complicates editing; NeRFs deliver excellent rendering but\nsuffer from structural ambiguity, hindering animation and manipulation; all\nrepresentations inherently struggle with the trade-off between data complexity\nand fidelity. To overcome these issues, we introduce a novel 3D Hierarchical\nProxy Node representation.

There exists a harmfulness direction that is\ndistinct from the refusal direction. As causal evidence, steering along the\nharmfulness direction can lead LLMs to interpret harmless instructions as\nharmful, but steering along the refusal direction tends to elicit refusal\nresponses directly without reversing the model's judgment on harmfulness.\nFurthermore, using our identified harmfulness concept, we find that certain\njailbreak methods work by reducing the refusal signals without reversing the\nmodel's internal belief of harmfulness. We also find that adversarially\nfinetuning models to accept harmful instructions has minimal impact on the\nmodel's internal belief of harmfulness. These insights lead to a practical\nsafety application: The model's latent harmfulness representation can serve as\nan intrinsic safeguard (Latent Guard) for detecting unsafe inputs and reducing\nover-refusals that is robust to finetuning attacks. For instance, our Latent\nGuard achieves performance comparable to or better than Llama Guard 3 8B, a\ndedicated finetuned safeguard model, across different jailbreak methods. Our\nfindings suggest that LLMs' internal understanding of harmfulness is more\nrobust than their refusal decision to diverse input instructions, offering a\nnew perspective to study AI safety"}

However, extending these\ngains to domains without clear-cut success criteria (e.g.,computer use) remains\na challenge: while humans can recognize suitable outcomes, translating this\nintuition into scalable rules is non-trivial. Multimodal Large Language\nModels(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge,\nhuman-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as\nverifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and\nrobotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a\nstrong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often\ngenerating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior. This bias is\npervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and can impact several\nmethods using MLLMs as evaluators (e.g.,data filtering). Notably, it occurs\ndespite MLLMs showing strong, human-aligned priors on desired behavior. To\naddress this, we propose Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a lightweight method\nthat enables more effective use of MLLMs' knowledge and reasoning by harnessing\ntheir own sampling mechanisms via unconditional and conditional generation. SGV\noperates in two steps: first, the MLLM is elicited to retrieve broad priors\nabout task completion, independent of the data under evaluation. Then,\nconditioned on self-generated priors, it reasons over and evaluates a candidate\ntrajectory. Enhanced with SGV, MLLM verifiers show gains of up to 20 points in\naccuracy and failure detection rates, and can perform real-time supervision of\nheterogeneous agents, boosting task completion of a GUI specialist in OSWorld,\na diffusion policy in robomimic, and a ReAct agent in VisualWebArena -- setting\na new state of the art on the benchmark, surpassing the previous best by 48%."}
