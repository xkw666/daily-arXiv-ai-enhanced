To leverage both the specialized strengths of small models and the\nrich semantic understanding of LLMs, we introduce a flipped knowledge\ndistillation paradigm, where LLM learns from SLM.

Code:\n  https://github.com/wangbing1416/DAEDCMD", "summary": "Nowadays, misinformation articles, especially multimodal ones, are widely\nspread on social media platforms and cause serious negative effects. To control\ntheir propagation, Multimodal Misinformation Detection (MMD) becomes an active\ntopic in the community to automatically identify misinformation. Previous MMD\nmethods focus on supervising detectors by collecting offline data. However, in\nreal-world scenarios, new events always continually emerge, making MMD models\ntrained on offline data consistently outdated and ineffective. To address this\nissue, training MMD models under online data streams is an alternative,\ninducing an emerging task named continual MMD. Unfortunately, it is hindered by\ntwo major challenges. First, training on new data consistently decreases the\ndetection performance on past data, named past knowledge forgetting. Second,\nthe social environment constantly evolves over time, affecting the\ngeneralization on future data. To alleviate these challenges, we propose to\nremember past knowledge by isolating interference between event-specific\nparameters with a Dirichlet process-based mixture-of-expert structure, and\nanticipate future environmental distributions by learning a continuous-time\ndynamics model. Accordingly, we induce a new continual MMD method DAEDCMD.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that DAEDCMD can consistently and\nsignificantly outperform the compared methods, including six MMD baselines and\nthree continual learning methods."}

To address this gap, we introduce a novel\nChinese benchmark dataset, termed CROP, comprising 993 admission records\nannotated with low, medium, and high-risk labels. To systematically examine the\npredictive capabilities and affective biases of LLMs in ROP risk\nstratification, we propose Affective-ROPTester, an automated evaluation\nframework incorporating three prompting strategies: Instruction-based,\nChain-of-Thought (CoT), and In-Context Learning (ICL). The Instruction scheme\nassesses LLMs' intrinsic knowledge and associated biases, whereas the CoT and\nICL schemes leverage external medical knowledge to enhance predictive accuracy.\nCrucially, we integrate emotional elements at the prompt level to investigate\nhow different affective framings influence the model's ability to predict ROP\nand its bias patterns. Empirical results derived from the CROP dataset yield\ntwo principal observations. First, LLMs demonstrate limited efficacy in ROP\nrisk prediction when operating solely on intrinsic knowledge, yet exhibit\nmarked performance gains when augmented with structured external inputs.\nSecond, affective biases are evident in the model outputs, with a consistent\ninclination toward overestimating medium- and high-risk cases. Third, compared\nto negative emotions, positive emotional framing contributes to mitigating\npredictive bias in model outputs. These findings highlight the critical role of\naffect-sensitive prompt engineering in enhancing diagnostic reliability and\nemphasize the utility of Affective-ROPTester as a framework for evaluating and\nmitigating affective bias in clinical language modeling systems."}

To address\nthis issue, we present SQLBarber, a system based on Large Language Models\n(LLMs) to generate customized and realistic SQL workloads. SQLBarber (i)\neliminates the need for users to manually craft SQL templates in advance, while\nproviding the flexibility to accept natural language specifications to\nconstrain SQL templates, (ii) scales efficiently to generate large volumes of\nqueries matching any user-defined cost distribution (e.g., cardinality and\nexecution plan cost), and (iii) uses execution statistics from Amazon Redshift\nand Snowflake to derive SQL template specifications and query cost\ndistributions that reflect real-world query characteristics.

In this paper, we explore whether\nthese techniques, originally developed for Transformers, can be applied to\nMamba, a recent architecture based on selective state-space layers that\nachieves Transformer-level performance with greater efficiency.

To address these\nchallenges, we first design a data curation pipeline that leverages\nopen-sourced VLMs and text-to-image diffusion models to construct CulTwin, a\nsynthetic cultural dataset. This dataset consists of paired\nconcept-caption-image triplets, where concepts visually resemble each other but\nrepresent different cultural contexts. Then, we fine-tune CLIP on CulTwin to\ncreate CultureCLIP, which aligns cultural concepts with contextually enhanced\ncaptions and synthetic images through customized contrastive learning, enabling\nfiner cultural differentiation while preserving generalization capabilities.\nExperiments on culturally relevant benchmarks show that CultureCLIP outperforms\nthe base CLIP, achieving up to a notable 5.49% improvement in fine-grained\nconcept recognition on certain tasks, while preserving CLIP's original\ngeneralization ability, validating the effectiveness of our data synthesis and\nVLM backbone training paradigm in capturing subtle cultural distinctions."}
