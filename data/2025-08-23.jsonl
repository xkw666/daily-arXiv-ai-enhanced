However, most existing\nwork does not consider these dimensions and leads to animations where\nagent-agent and agent-environment interactions are largely limited to steering\nand fixed higher-level goal extrapolation.\n  We propose a novel method that exploits large language models (LLMs) to\ncontrol agents' movement. Our method has two main components: a dialogue system\nand language-driven navigation. We periodically query agent-centric LLMs\nconditioned on character personalities, roles, desires, and relationships to\ncontrol the generation of inter-agent dialogue when necessitated by the spatial\nand social relationships with neighbouring agents. We then use the conversation\nand each agent's personality, emotional state, vision, and physical state to\ncontrol the navigation and steering of each agent. Our model thus enables\nagents to make motion decisions based on both their perceptual inputs and the\nongoing dialogue.\n  We validate our method in two complex scenarios that exemplify the interplay\nbetween social interactions, steering, and crowding. In these scenarios, we\nobserve that grouping and ungrouping of agents automatically occur.\nAdditionally, our experiments show that our method serves as an\ninformation-passing mechanism within the crowd.

In this work,\nwe propose \\textbf{SemToken}, a semantic-aware tokenization framework that\njointly reduces token redundancy and improves computation efficiency. SemToken\nfirst extracts contextual semantic embeddings via lightweight encoders and\nperforms local semantic clustering to merge semantically equivalent tokens.\nThen, it allocates heterogeneous token granularity based on semantic density,\nallowing finer-grained tokenization in content-rich regions and coarser\ncompression in repetitive or low-entropy spans. SemToken can be seamlessly\nintegrated with modern language models and attention acceleration methods.\nExperiments on long-context language modeling benchmarks such as WikiText-103\nand LongBench show that SemToken achieves up to $2.4\\times$ reduction in token\ncount and $1.9\\times$ speedup, with negligible or no degradation in perplexity\nand downstream accuracy. Our findings suggest that semantic structure offers a\npromising new axis for optimizing tokenization and computation in large\nlanguage models."}

We present DiagECG, a\nnovel framework that integrates time-series and language modeling by enabling\nlarge language models to process 12-lead ECG signals for clinical text\ngeneration tasks. Our approach discretizes continuous ECG embeddings into\nsymbolic tokens using a lead-independent encoder and quantization module. These\ntokens are then used to extend the vocabulary of LLM, allowing the model to\nhandle both ECG and natural language inputs in a unified manner. To bridge the\nmodality gap, we pretrain the model on an autoregressive ECG forecasting task,\nenabling the LLM to model temporal dynamics using its native language modeling\ncapabilities. Finally, we perform instruction tuning on both ECG question\nanswering and diagnostic report generation. Without modifying the core model,\nDiagECG achieves strong performance across tasks while maintaining\ngeneralization to out-of-distribution settings. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of each component and highlight the potential of\nintegrating symbolic ECG representations into LLMs for medical reasoning."}

This shortage has become a critical bottleneck,\nhindering the development and fair comparison of representation learning\nmethods on heterogeneous text-attributed graphs. In this paper, we introduce\nCITE - Catalytic Information Textual Entities Graph, the first and largest\nheterogeneous text-attributed citation graph benchmark for catalytic materials.\nCITE comprises over 438K nodes and 1.2M edges, spanning four relation types. In\naddition, we establish standardized evaluation procedures and conduct extensive\nbenchmarking on the node classification task, as well as ablation experiments\non the heterogeneous and textual properties of CITE. We compare four classes of\nlearning paradigms, including homogeneous graph models, heterogeneous graph\nmodels, LLM(Large Language Model)-centric models, and LLM+Graph models.

While\nnumerous articles report on the accuracy and reliability of the most popular\nautomated classifiers, less has been written on the downstream effects of\nclassification errors on measurements and statistical inferences (e.g., the\nestimate of correlations and effect sizes in regressions). This paper proposes\na Bayesian approach to study the effects of algorithmic errors on key\nscientific questions, including the effect of siblings on children's language\nexperience and the association between children's production and their input.\nIn both the most commonly used \\gls{lena}, and an open-source alternative (the\nVoice Type Classifier from the ACLEW system), we find that classification\nerrors can significantly distort estimates. For instance, automated annotations\nunderestimated the negative effect of siblings on adult input by 20--80\\%,\npotentially placing it below statistical significance thresholds. We further\nshow that a Bayesian calibration approach for recovering unbiased estimates of\neffect sizes can be effective and insightful, but does not provide a fool-proof\nsolution. Both the issue reported and our solution may apply to any classifier\ninvolving event detection and classification with non-zero error rates."}
