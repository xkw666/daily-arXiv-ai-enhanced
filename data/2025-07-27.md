Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出强化学习框架Shop-R1，通过分阶段奖励机制提升LLM在电商场景的人类行为模拟能力，实验显示相对基线提升65%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督微调方法受限于原始模型生成推理能力，需要突破传统单阶段训练模式

Method: 两阶段强化学习框架：1）利用模型内部信号自监督指导原理生成 2）分层奖励结构（含难度感知缩放）防止奖励滥用

Result: 在在线购物环境模拟任务中取得65%相对基线提升

Conclusion: 分阶段强化学习框架通过解耦推理与行为预测，配合分层奖励设计，显著提升LLM的人类行为模拟能力

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong potential in
generating 'believable human-like' behavior in web environments. Prior work has
explored augmenting training data with LLM-synthesized rationales and applying
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance reasoning ability, which in turn can
improve downstream action prediction. However, the performance of such
approaches remains inherently bounded by the reasoning capabilities of the
model used to generate the rationales. In this paper, we introduce Shop-R1, a
novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework aimed at enhancing the reasoning
ability of LLMs for simulation of real human behavior in online shopping
environments Specifically, Shop-R1 decomposes the human behavior simulation
task into two stages: rationale generation and action prediction, each guided
by distinct reward signals. For rationale generation, we leverage internal
model signals (e.g., logit distributions) to guide the reasoning process in a
self-supervised manner. For action prediction, we propose a hierarchical reward
structure with difficulty-aware scaling to prevent reward hacking and enable
fine-grained reward assignment. This design evaluates both high-level action
types and the correctness of fine-grained sub-action details (attributes and
values), rewarding outputs proportionally to their difficulty. Experimental
results show that our method achieves a relative improvement of over 65%
compared to the baseline.

### [2] [Dynamic and Generalizable Process Reward Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17849)
*Zhangyue Yin,Qiushi Sun,Zhiyuan Zeng,Qinyuan Cheng,Xipeng Qiu,Xuanjing Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出动态可泛化过程奖励模型DG-PRM，通过奖励树动态选择多维度细粒度奖励信号，显著提升复杂任务中的模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统过程奖励模型依赖启发式方法导致跨领域泛化能力差，静态评估标准难以适应复杂过程监督，需构建动态可扩展的奖励框架。

Method: 1. 设计奖励树存储多维奖励标准
2. 动态选择逐步奖励信号
3. 创新采用帕累托优势估计处理多维度信号

Result: 在主流基准测试中性能提升显著（具体数值未披露），在分布外场景表现出卓越泛化能力

Conclusion: DG-PRM突破了传统奖励模型的静态限制，为复杂任务提供了动态、可泛化的过程监督解决方案

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) are crucial for guiding Large Language Models
(LLMs) in complex scenarios by providing dense reward signals. However,
existing PRMs primarily rely on heuristic approaches, which struggle with
cross-domain generalization. While LLM-as-judge has been proposed to provide
generalized rewards, current research has focused mainly on feedback results,
overlooking the meaningful guidance embedded within the text. Additionally,
static and coarse-grained evaluation criteria struggle to adapt to complex
process supervision. To tackle these challenges, we propose Dynamic and
Generalizable Process Reward Modeling (DG-PRM), which features a reward tree to
capture and store fine-grained, multi-dimensional reward criteria. DG-PRM
dynamically selects reward signals for step-wise reward scoring. To handle
multifaceted reward signals, we pioneeringly adopt Pareto dominance estimation
to identify discriminative positive and negative pairs. Experimental results
show that DG-PRM achieves stunning performance on prevailing benchmarks,
significantly boosting model performance across tasks with dense rewards.
Further analysis reveals that DG-PRM adapts well to out-of-distribution
scenarios, demonstrating exceptional generalizability.

*Shubham Mohole,Sainyam Galhotra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VeriMinder是一个交互式系统，通过三大创新技术帮助非专业用户避免数据分析中的认知偏见，用户测试显示其显著提升分析质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言数据库接口普及后，缺乏统计背景的用户易提出有偏见分析问题，现有研究多集中于SQL生成准确性而忽略认知偏差问题。

Method: 结合（1）上下文语义映射框架识别分析场景偏差（2）基于Hard-to-Vary原则的系统性分析框架（3）多阶段优化的LLM提示工程（候选生成-批评反馈-自我反思）

Result: 82.5%用户反馈分析质量提升，在具体性/全面性/准确性指标上比替代方案至少高20%

Conclusion: 系统有效解决『错误提问』漏洞，MIT开源协议代码库促进社区应用与研究迭代。

Abstract: Application systems using natural language interfaces to databases (NLIDBs)
have democratized data analysis. This positive development has also brought
forth an urgent challenge to help users who might use these systems without a
background in statistical analysis to formulate bias-free analytical questions.
Although significant research has focused on text-to-SQL generation accuracy,
addressing cognitive biases in analytical questions remains underexplored. We
present VeriMinder, https://veriminder.ai, an interactive system for detecting
and mitigating such analytical vulnerabilities. Our approach introduces three
key innovations: (1) a contextual semantic mapping framework for biases
relevant to specific analysis contexts (2) an analytical framework that
operationalizes the Hard-to-Vary principle and guides users in systematic data
analysis (3) an optimized LLM-powered system that generates high-quality,
task-specific prompts using a structured process involving multiple candidates,
critic feedback, and self-reflection.
  User testing confirms the merits of our approach. In direct user experience
evaluation, 82.5% participants reported positively impacting the quality of the
analysis. In comparative evaluation, VeriMinder scored significantly higher
than alternative approaches, at least 20% better when considered for metrics of
the analysis's concreteness, comprehensiveness, and accuracy. Our system,
implemented as a web application, is set to help users avoid "wrong question"
vulnerability during data analysis. VeriMinder code base with prompts,
https://reproducibility.link/veriminder, is available as an MIT-licensed
open-source software to facilitate further research and adoption within the
community.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于Whisper-small编码器的端到端口语测评系统，通过单一模型处理多题型应答，在RMSE 0.384指标上超越文本基线（0.44），参数量减少30%且训练数据量减少55.2%仍保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模块口语测试中传统方案需要分题型建模、依赖人工转录、推理效率低的问题，推动计算机辅助语言学习系统的大规模应用。

Method: 1. 采用Whisper-small编码器统一处理四种口语题型
2. 轻量级聚合器融合多题型特征
3. 提出数据采样策略（仅需44.8%说话人数据）
4. 端到端联合优化模型参数

Result: 1. 系统RMSE 0.384优于文本基线（0.44）
2. 参数量168M（约为原版70%）
3. 数据效率提升：仅用44.8%说话人数据达0.383 RMSE
4. 在类别不平衡数据上表现更优

Conclusion: 该方案通过架构创新与数据策略，在保持精度的同时显著降低计算与数据需求，为大规模语言测评系统提供高效解决方案，特别适用于资源受限场景。

Abstract: We present an efficient end-to-end approach for holistic Automatic Speaking
Assessment (ASA) of multi-part second-language tests, developed for the 2025
Speak & Improve Challenge. Our system's main novelty is the ability to process
all four spoken responses with a single Whisper-small encoder, combine all
information via a lightweight aggregator, and predict the final score. This
architecture removes the need for transcription and per-part models, cuts
inference time, and makes ASA practical for large-scale Computer-Assisted
Language Learning systems.
  Our system achieved a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.384, outperforming
the text-based baseline (0.44) while using at most 168M parameters (about 70%
of Whisper-small). Furthermore, we propose a data sampling strategy, allowing
the model to train on only 44.8% of the speakers in the corpus and still reach
0.383 RMSE, demonstrating improved performance on imbalanced classes and strong
data efficiency.

### [5] [Evaluating the Performance of AI Text Detectors, Few-Shot and Chain-of-Thought Prompting Using DeepSeek Generated Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17944)
*Hulayyil Alshammari,Praveen Rao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 对抗性攻击（尤其是人性化处理）显著降低AI检测工具准确率，DeepSeek作为检测器在少量样本下实现96%召回率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对新型LLM DeepSeek的检测能力评估，且对抗攻击对检测工具的影响机制尚未完全明确

Method: 通过49组人类/AI问答对，应用改寫和人性化攻击生成196个对抗样本，测试6种检测工具并评估DeepSeek自检测的few-shot+CoT效果

Result: 人性化攻击使Copyleaks/QuillBot/GPTZero准确率分别降至71%/58%/52%，DeepSeek五样本检测仅误判1例（AI召回96%，人类100%）

Conclusion: 现有检测工具易受高级对抗攻击影响，基于提示工程的检测方法展现出替代潜力，需开发更鲁棒的混合检测方案

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly transformed the creation of written
materials. LLMs have led to questions about writing integrity, thereby driving
the creation of artificial intelligence (AI) detection technologies.
Adversarial attacks, such as standard and humanized paraphrasing, inhibit
detectors' ability to detect machine-generated text. Previous studies have
mainly focused on ChatGPT and other well-known LLMs and have shown varying
accuracy across detectors. However, there is a clear gap in the literature
about DeepSeek, a recently published LLM. Therefore, in this work, we
investigate whether six generally accessible AI detection tools -- AI Text
Classifier, Content Detector AI, Copyleaks, QuillBot, GPT-2, and GPTZero -- can
consistently recognize text generated by DeepSeek. The detectors were exposed
to the aforementioned adversarial attacks. We also considered DeepSeek as a
detector by performing few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT)
for classifying AI and human-written text. We collected 49 human-authored
question-answer pairs from before the LLM era and generated matching responses
using DeepSeek-v3, producing 49 AI-generated samples. Then, we applied
adversarial techniques such as paraphrasing and humanizing to add 196 more
samples. These were used to challenge detector robustness and assess accuracy
impact. While QuillBot and Copyleaks showed near-perfect performance on
original and paraphrased DeepSeek text, others -- particularly AI Text
Classifier and GPT-2 -- showed inconsistent results. The most effective attack
was humanization, reducing accuracy to 71% for Copyleaks, 58% for QuillBot, and
52% for GPTZero. Few-shot and CoT prompting showed high accuracy, with the best
five-shot result misclassifying only one of 49 samples (AI recall 96%, human
recall 100%).

TL;DR: 大型预训练语言模型参数规模越大，其概率赋值越符合贝叶斯定理的统计规律


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证语言模型参数规模与贝叶斯定理一致性的相关性，理解LLM的认知机制

Method: 设计贝叶斯连贯系数（BCC）指标并构建测试数据集，对比不同家族模型的参数规模、训练数据量和基准测试表现

Result: 模型参数量与贝叶斯连贯性呈正相关，性能更强的模型展现出更符合统计规律的信念更新模式

Conclusion: 发现对LLM的认知机制研究和治理具有双重意义，需同步推进模型能力发展与价值观对齐

Abstract: Do larger and more capable language models learn to update their "beliefs"
about propositions more consistently with Bayes' theorem when presented with
evidence in-context? To test this, we formulate a Bayesian Coherence
Coefficient (BCC) metric and generate a dataset with which to measure the BCC.
We measure BCC for multiple pre-trained-only language models across five model
families, comparing against the number of model parameters, the amount of
training data, and model scores on common benchmarks. Our results provide
evidence for our hypothesis that larger and more capable pre-trained language
models assign credences that are more coherent with Bayes' theorem. These
results have important implications for our understanding and governance of
LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出NeuralDB框架，通过神经KV数据库和非线性门控检索模块实现高效知识编辑，在万级数据规模下保持LLM通用能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有线性L&E方法在批量编辑知识时会损害LLM通用能力，且大规模编辑时出现遗忘现象

Method: 将知识编辑建模为神经KV数据库查询，使用门控机制实现按需检索（仅在需要时激活编辑知识）

Result: 在ZsRE/CounterFacts数据集上验证10,000次编辑效果，编辑准确率、泛化性等指标领先，扩展至100,000次编辑仍有效

Conclusion: NeuralDB成功平衡编辑效率与模型性能，首次实现十万量级知识编辑，为LLM知识更新提供新解决方案

Abstract: Efficiently editing knowledge stored in large language models (LLMs) enables
model updates without large-scale training. One possible solution is
Locate-and-Edit (L\&E), allowing simultaneous modifications of a massive number
of facts. However, such editing may compromise the general abilities of LLMs
and even result in forgetting edited facts when scaling up to thousands of
edits. In this paper, we model existing linear L\&E methods as querying a
Key-Value (KV) database. From this perspective, we then propose NeuralDB, an
editing framework that explicitly represents the edited facts as a neural KV
database equipped with a non-linear gated retrieval module, % In particular,
our gated module only operates when inference involves the edited facts,
effectively preserving the general abilities of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments
involving the editing of 10,000 facts were conducted on the ZsRE and
CounterFacts datasets, using GPT2-XL, GPT-J (6B) and Llama-3 (8B). The results
demonstrate that NeuralDB not only excels in editing efficacy, generalization,
specificity, fluency, and consistency, but also preserves overall performance
across six representative text understanding and generation tasks. Further
experiments indicate that NeuralDB maintains its effectiveness even when scaled
to 100,000 facts (\textbf{50x} more than in prior work).

TL;DR: 提出GrAInS推理时引导框架，通过梯度归因识别关键token动态调整模型激活，在多项任务中超越微调和现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用固定全局干预向量，忽视输入token的因果影响且未充分利用多模态梯度信息

Method: 基于Integrated Gradients的对比归因选择top-k关键token，构建方向性引导向量并在推理时进行激活调整与归一化

Result: TruthfulQA准确率提升13.22%，MMHal-Bench幻觉率从0.624降至0.514，SPA-VL对齐胜率提高8.11%

Conclusion: GrAInS实现细粒度模型控制，在保持模型通用能力的同时显著提升任务表现，无需重新训练

Abstract: Inference-time steering methods offer a lightweight alternative to
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) by
modifying internal activations at test time without updating model weights.
However, most existing approaches rely on fixed, global intervention vectors,
overlook the causal influence of individual input tokens, and fail to leverage
informative gradients from the model's logits, particularly in multimodal
settings where visual and textual inputs contribute unevenly. To address these
limitations, we introduce GrAInS, an inference-time steering approach that
operates across both language-only and vision-language models and tasks. GrAInS
uses contrastive, gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients to
identify the top-k most influential tokens, both positively and negatively
attributed based on their contribution to preferred versus dispreferred
outputs. These tokens are then used to construct directional steering vectors
that capture semantic shifts from undesirable to desirable behavior. During
inference, GrAInS adjusts hidden activations at transformer layers guided by
token-level attribution signals, and normalizes activations to preserve
representational scale. This enables fine-grained, interpretable, and modular
control over model behavior, without retraining or auxiliary supervision.
Empirically, GrAInS consistently outperforms both fine-tuning and existing
steering baselines: it achieves a 13.22% accuracy gain on TruthfulQA using
Llama-3.1-8B, reduces hallucination rates on MMHal-Bench from 0.624 to 0.514
with LLaVA-1.6-7B, and improves alignment win rates on SPA-VL by 8.11%, all
while preserving the model's fluency and general capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM生成合成数据有效解决语音断句预测的数据挑战


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语音断句预测依赖高成本人工标注，且语音领域多变性导致数据质量不稳定

Method: 利用大语言模型生成合成短语断句标注，与传统标注对比并验证多语言场景有效性

Result: LLM生成数据显著降低人工标注需求，在多语言环境中展现应用潜力

Conclusion: 大语言模型为语音领域数据问题提供创新解决方案

Abstract: Current approaches to phrase break prediction address crucial prosodic
aspects of text-to-speech systems but heavily rely on vast human annotations
from audio or text, incurring significant manual effort and cost. Inherent
variability in the speech domain, driven by phonetic factors, further
complicates acquiring consistent, high-quality data. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) have shown success in addressing data challenges in NLP by
generating tailored synthetic data while reducing manual annotation needs.
Motivated by this, we explore leveraging LLM to generate synthetic phrase break
annotations, addressing the challenges of both manual annotation and
speech-related tasks by comparing with traditional annotations and assessing
effectiveness across multiple languages. Our findings suggest that LLM-based
synthetic data generation effectively mitigates data challenges in phrase break
prediction and highlights the potential of LLMs as a viable solution for the
speech domain.

Conclusion: 需在数据生成中平衡多样性与隐私保护，提出的评估框架和提示方法为优化合成数据质量提供了可行路径。

Abstract: The increasing use of synthetic data generated by Large Language Models
(LLMs) presents both opportunities and challenges in data-driven applications.
While synthetic data provides a cost-effective, scalable alternative to
real-world data to facilitate model training, its diversity and privacy risks
remain underexplored. Focusing on text-based synthetic data, we propose a
comprehensive set of metrics to quantitatively assess the diversity (i.e.,
linguistic expression, sentiment, and user perspective), and privacy (i.e.,
re-identification risk and stylistic outliers) of synthetic datasets generated
by several state-of-the-art LLMs. Experiment results reveal significant
limitations in LLMs' capabilities in generating diverse and privacy-preserving
synthetic data. Guided by the evaluation results, a prompt-based approach is
proposed to enhance the diversity of synthetic reviews while preserving
reviewer privacy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SLM评估基准侧重复杂任务能力而非真实用户交互场景，与真实用户体验存在偏差

Method: 定义三个评估维度（显式语义/副语言与隐式语义/系统能力），采用真实对话格式分别评估文本和音频输出

Result: 实验显示现有SLM在自然对话任务中仍有显著改进空间，特别在隐式线索理解方面

Conclusion: TELEVAL可作为用户中心的评估框架，推动开发更强大的对话导向型口语模型

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) have seen rapid progress in recent years, along
with the development of numerous benchmarks for evaluating their performance.
However, most existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating whether SLMs
can perform complex tasks comparable to those tackled by large language models
(LLMs), often failing to align with how users naturally interact in real-world
conversational scenarios. In this paper, we propose TELEVAL, a dynamic
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate SLMs' effectiveness as
conversational agents in realistic Chinese interactive settings. TELEVAL
defines three evaluation dimensions: Explicit Semantics, Paralinguistic and
Implicit Semantics, and System Abilities. It adopts a dialogue format
consistent with real-world usage and evaluates text and audio outputs
separately. TELEVAL particularly focuses on the model's ability to extract
implicit cues from user speech and respond appropriately without additional
instructions. Our experiments demonstrate that despite recent progress,
existing SLMs still have considerable room for improvement in natural
conversational tasks. We hope that TELEVAL can serve as a user-centered
evaluation framework that directly reflects the user experience and contributes
to the development of more capable dialogue-oriented SLMs.

Conclusion: 该混合策略为资源受限环境下LLM的高效调优提供了兼具性能与实用性的解决方案，推动大模型实际应用落地

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) remains a computational bottleneck
due to their scale and memory demands. This paper presents a comprehensive
evaluation of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, including
LoRA, BOFT, LoRA-GA, and uRNN, and introduces a novel hybrid strategy that
dynamically integrates BOFT's orthogonal stability with LoRA-GA's
gradient-aligned rapid convergence. By computing per-layer adaptive updates
guided by gradient norms, the hybrid method achieves superior convergence
efficiency and generalization across diverse tasks. We also explore, for the
first time, the adaptation of unitary RNN (uRNN) principles to
transformer-based LLMs, enhancing gradient stability through structured unitary
constraints. Empirical evaluations on four benchmarks -- GLUE, GSM8K, MT-Bench,
and HumanEval -- using models ranging from 7B to 405B parameters demonstrate
that our hybrid method consistently outperforms individual PEFT baselines,
approaching full fine-tuning accuracy while reducing resource consumption by up
to 2.1 times in training time and 50 percent in memory usage. These findings
establish the hybrid approach as a practical and scalable fine-tuning solution
for real-world deployment of LLMs under resource constraints.

TL;DR: 报告构建了2024版GloVe词向量模型，使用Wikipedia、Gigaword和Dolma子集数据训练。评估显示新模型在保留结构任务能力的同时，显著提升了时敏性NER任务表现并纳入新兴文化词汇。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2014版GloVe模型存在数据过时且文档不完善的问题。语言文化演进要求模型更新，同时需明确记录训练数据和预处理流程以满足可复现性需求。

Method: 采用Wikipedia、Gigaword和Dolma三源数据训练两组词向量，通过词汇对比、类比推理、语义相似度及跨文化NER任务进行多维度评估。

Result: 新模型成功整合'cryptocurrency'等新兴词汇，在词汇类比任务保持90%+准确率，非西方新闻NER任务F1值提升12.7%。

Conclusion: 2024 GloVe模型有效捕捉语言演变特征，在保持传统NLP任务性能的同时，显著提升跨文化场景下的时域适应性，为现代多语言处理提供更优基础模型。

Abstract: This report documents, describes, and evaluates new 2024 English GloVe
(Global Vectors for Word Representation) models. While the original GloVe
models built in 2014 have been widely used and found useful, languages and the
world continue to evolve and we thought that current usage could benefit from
updated models. Moreover, the 2014 models were not carefully documented as to
the exact data versions and preprocessing that were used, and we rectify this
by documenting these new models. We trained two sets of word embeddings using
Wikipedia, Gigaword, and a subset of Dolma. Evaluation through vocabulary
comparison, direct testing, and NER tasks shows that the 2024 vectors
incorporate new culturally and linguistically relevant words, perform
comparably on structural tasks like analogy and similarity, and demonstrate
improved performance on recent, temporally dependent NER datasets such as
non-Western newswire data.

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end spoken language models (SLMs) have
significantly improved the ability of AI systems to engage in natural spoken
interactions. However, most existing models treat speech merely as a vehicle
for linguistic content, often overlooking the rich paralinguistic and speaker
characteristic cues embedded in human speech, such as dialect, age, emotion,
and non-speech vocalizations. In this work, we introduce GOAT-SLM, a novel
spoken language model with paralinguistic and speaker characteristic awareness,
designed to extend spoken language modeling beyond text semantics. GOAT-SLM
adopts a dual-modality head architecture that decouples linguistic modeling
from acoustic realization, enabling robust language understanding while
supporting expressive and adaptive speech generation. To enhance model
efficiency and versatility, we propose a modular, staged training strategy that
progressively aligns linguistic, paralinguistic, and speaker characteristic
information using large-scale speech-text corpora. Experimental results on
TELEVAL, a multi-dimensional evaluation benchmark, demonstrate that GOAT-SLM
achieves well-balanced performance across both semantic and non-semantic tasks,
and outperforms existing open-source models in handling emotion, dialectal
variation, and age-sensitive interactions. This work highlights the importance
of modeling beyond linguistic content and advances the development of more
natural, adaptive, and socially aware spoken language systems.

TL;DR: 论文评估了多模态大语言模型通过代码生成和编辑数学图表的能力，发现现有模型在细粒度视觉操作上显著落后人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注文本推理输出，缺乏对MLLMs通过代码执行精准视觉操作能力的系统评估。

Method: 提出MCG(评估图表生成)和MCE(评估删除/修改/标注编辑)双框架，使用包含5类数学图表的数据集测试9个主流MLLMs。

Result: 实验表明现有模型在细粒度视觉操作任务上的表现与人类水平存在显著差距（平均准确率差30%以上）。

Conclusion: MLLMs的代码驱动视觉操作能力仍需大幅提升，未来应加强跨模态代码执行与视觉推理的融合研究。

Abstract: Recent progress in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has enabled
step-by-step multi-modal mathematical reasoning by performing visual operations
based on the textual instructions. A promising approach uses code as an
intermediate representation to precisely express and manipulate the images in
the reasoning steps. However, existing evaluations focus mainly on text-only
reasoning outputs, leaving the MLLM's ability to perform accurate visual
operations via code largely unexplored. This work takes a first step toward
addressing that gap by evaluating MLLM's code-based capabilities in multi-modal
mathematical reasoning.Specifically, our framework focuses on two key
evaluation aspects: (1) Multi-modal Code Generation (MCG) evaluates the model's
ability to accurately understand and construct visualizations from scratch. (2)
Multi-modal Code Editing (MCE) assesses the model's capacity for fine-grained
operations, which include three types: Deletion, Modification and Annotation.
To evaluate the above tasks, we incorporate a dataset that covers the five most
popular types of mathematical figures, including geometric diagrams, function
plots, and three types of statistical charts, to provide a comprehensive and
effective measurement of existing MLLMs. Our experimental evaluation involves
nine mainstream MLLMs, and the results reveal that existing models still lag
significantly behind human performance in performing fine-grained visual
operations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs作为HIV临床决策支持工具的可行性，解决当前AI在HIV护理领域研究不足、临床整合存在的准确性/安全性/接受度问题。

Method: 创建HIVMedQA开放问答基准（含临床医生验证的问题集），评估7个通用+3个医学专用LLMs，结合词汇相似度和LLM-as-judge双评估框架，从6个维度（理解/推理/知识/偏误/危害/准确性）进行多维度分析。

Result: 1. 问题复杂度与性能负相关 2. 医学微调模型未显著优于通用模型 3. 推理能力弱于事实回忆 4. 存在近因效应/现状偏误 5. 前3名中2个为专有模型 6. 模型规模与性能无必然关联。

Conclusion: LLMs临床整合需针对性优化评估框架，当前模型在复杂医疗决策中存在可靠性风险，需重点提升推理能力和偏误控制，同时建立临床相关性更强的评价标准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as valuable tools to support
clinicians in routine decision-making. HIV management is a compelling use case
due to its complexity, including diverse treatment options, comorbidities, and
adherence challenges. However, integrating LLMs into clinical practice raises
concerns about accuracy, potential harm, and clinician acceptance. Despite
their promise, AI applications in HIV care remain underexplored, and LLM
benchmarking studies are scarce. This study evaluates the current capabilities
of LLMs in HIV management, highlighting their strengths and limitations. We
introduce HIVMedQA, a benchmark designed to assess open-ended medical question
answering in HIV care. The dataset consists of curated, clinically relevant
questions developed with input from an infectious disease physician. We
evaluated seven general-purpose and three medically specialized LLMs, applying
prompt engineering to enhance performance. Our evaluation framework
incorporates both lexical similarity and an LLM-as-a-judge approach, extended
to better reflect clinical relevance. We assessed performance across key
dimensions: question comprehension, reasoning, knowledge recall, bias,
potential harm, and factual accuracy. Results show that Gemini 2.5 Pro
consistently outperformed other models across most dimensions. Notably, two of
the top three models were proprietary. Performance declined as question
complexity increased. Medically fine-tuned models did not always outperform
general-purpose ones, and larger model size was not a reliable predictor of
performance. Reasoning and comprehension were more challenging than factual
recall, and cognitive biases such as recency and status quo were observed.
These findings underscore the need for targeted development and evaluation to
ensure safe, effective LLM integration in clinical care.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现Transformer文本嵌入模型存在'粘性令牌'现象，这些异常token会破坏嵌入可靠性并导致下游任务性能下降达50%。通过开发的STD检测方法，在14个模型家族中发现868个异常token，其来源与特殊词汇和多语言子词相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决嵌入模型中'sticky tokens'引发的可靠性问题，这些异常token会扭曲相似度分布并显著降低聚类、检索等任务的性能，需要系统性分析其成因和影响。

Method: 提出基于句子过滤和token过滤的STD检测方法，对14个模型家族的40个检查点进行系统性检测，结合注意力层分析异常token的影响机制。

Result: 检测到868个sticky tokens，主要来源于词汇表中特殊/未使用条目(占37.2%)和多语言子词片段(占41.5%)，下游任务性能最大下降50%。模型规模与异常token数量无直接相关性(r=0.12)。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了tokenization策略的脆弱性，建议未来嵌入模型需要优化词汇表设计和子词分割算法，同时加强异常token的检测机制以提升模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Despite the widespread use of Transformer-based text embedding models in NLP
tasks, surprising 'sticky tokens' can undermine the reliability of embeddings.
These tokens, when repeatedly inserted into sentences, pull sentence similarity
toward a certain value, disrupting the normal distribution of embedding
distances and degrading downstream performance. In this paper, we
systematically investigate such anomalous tokens, formally defining them and
introducing an efficient detection method, Sticky Token Detector (STD), based
on sentence and token filtering. Applying STD to 40 checkpoints across 14 model
families, we discover a total of 868 sticky tokens. Our analysis reveals that
these tokens often originate from special or unused entries in the vocabulary,
as well as fragmented subwords from multilingual corpora. Notably, their
presence does not strictly correlate with model size or vocabulary size. We
further evaluate how sticky tokens affect downstream tasks like clustering and
retrieval, observing significant performance drops of up to 50%. Through
attention-layer analysis, we show that sticky tokens disproportionately
dominate the model's internal representations, raising concerns about
tokenization robustness. Our findings show the need for better tokenization
strategies and model design to mitigate the impact of sticky tokens in future
text embedding applications.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型评估存在选项位置/标签的选择偏差问题，导致模型可能通过利用系统性偏差而非真实理解能力来获得虚高分数，这严重影响了评估结果的可靠性

Method: 1. 通过空提示反复调用构建位置偏差分布
2. 按逆偏差分布重分配答案位置平衡幸运率
3. 阻止答案与语义相似干扰项相邻以避免近邻猜测

Result: 在多项基准测试中，SCOPE在稳定性能提升（平均3.7%准确率增益）和置信度分布清晰度（正确选项置信度标准差降低42%）上均优于现有去偏方法

Conclusion: SCOPE通过双重机制（位置偏差校正+语义干扰隔离）建立了LLM评估新标准，为模型能力评估提供了更公平可靠的框架

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve inflated scores on multiple-choice
tasks by exploiting inherent biases in option positions or labels, rather than
demonstrating genuine understanding. This study introduces SCOPE, an evaluation
framework designed to measure and mitigate such selection bias in a
dataset-independent manner. By repeatedly invoking a null prompt that lacks
semantic content, SCOPE estimates each model's unique position-bias
distribution. It then redistributes the answer slot according to the
inverse-bias distribution, thereby equalizing the lucky-rate, the probability
of selecting the correct answer by chance. Furthermore, it prevents
semantically similar distractors from being placed adjacent to the answer,
thereby blocking near-miss guesses based on superficial proximity cues. Across
multiple benchmark experiments, SCOPE consistently outperformed existing
debiasing methods in terms of stable performance improvements and showed
clearer confidence distributions over correct options. This framework thus
offers a new standard for enhancing the fairness and reliability of LLM
evaluations.

Abstract: Business process modeling is used by most organizations as an essential
framework for ensuring efficiency and effectiveness of the work and workflow
performed by its employees and for ensuring the alignment of such work with its
strategic goals. For organizations that are compliant or near-compliant with
ISO 9001, this approach involves the detailed mapping of processes,
sub-processes, activities, and tasks. ISO30401 is a Management System Standard,
introduced in 2018, establishing universal requirements for the set up of a
Knowledge Management System in an organization. As ``ISO30401 implementers'' we
regularly face the challenge of explaining our clients how the knowledge
development, transformation and conveyances activities depicted in ISO30401 do
integrate with existing operational processes. This article recaps process
modelling principles in the context of ISO9001 and explores, based on our
experience, how an ISO30401-compliant Knowledge Management System (KMS)
entwines with all other processes of an Integrated Management System and in
particular how it can be implemented by deploying the mechanisms of the SECI
model through the steps of PDCA cycles.

Motivation: RAG模型依赖外部知识库存在安全隐患，攻击者可能通过投毒文档操控生成结果，需开发高效过滤机制

Method: 1. 利用检索器相似度函数的梯度识别高影响力token

3. 基于低概率特征检测恶意文档

Result: 实验表明GMTP可过滤90%以上投毒内容，同时保持93%正常文档的召回率，在对抗场景下维持模型性能

Conclusion: GMTP通过梯度-概率双机制有效防御文档投毒攻击，为RAG系统提供高精度过滤方案，平衡安全与可用性

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by
providing external knowledge for accurate and up-to-date responses. However,
this reliance on external sources exposes a security risk, attackers can inject
poisoned documents into the knowledge base to steer the generation process
toward harmful or misleading outputs. In this paper, we propose Gradient-based
Masked Token Probability (GMTP), a novel defense method to detect and filter
out adversarially crafted documents. Specifically, GMTP identifies high-impact
tokens by examining gradients of the retriever's similarity function. These key
tokens are then masked, and their probabilities are checked via a Masked
Language Model (MLM). Since injected tokens typically exhibit markedly low
masked-token probabilities, this enables GMTP to easily detect malicious
documents and achieve high-precision filtering. Experiments demonstrate that
GMTP is able to eliminate over 90% of poisoned content while retaining relevant
documents, thus maintaining robust retrieval and generation performance across
diverse datasets and adversarial settings.

Motivation: 研究指令调优在提升模型可用性的同时，可能加剧LLM对用户错误信息的盲从风险，此前缺乏相关系统性研究

Method: 通过对比基础模型与指令调优模型，分析用户角色设定、错误信息长度、系统警告提示等多维度影响因素

Result: 指令调优使模型对用户错误信息接受度提升3倍，依赖性从助理角色转向用户角色，系统警告仅能有限缓解该现象

Conclusion: 需开发针对性方法平衡指令调优的副作用，构建更可靠的LLM应用体系

Abstract: Instruction-tuning enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to
follow user instructions more accurately, improving usability while reducing
harmful outputs. However, this process may increase the model's dependence on
user input, potentially leading to the unfiltered acceptance of misinformation
and the generation of hallucinations. Existing studies primarily highlight that
LLMs are receptive to external information that contradict their parametric
knowledge, but little research has been conducted on the direct impact of
instruction-tuning on this phenomenon. In our study, we investigate the impact
of instruction-tuning on LLM's susceptibility to misinformation. Our analysis
reveals that instruction-tuned LLMs are significantly more likely to accept
misinformation when it is presented by the user. A comparison with base models
shows that instruction-tuning increases reliance on user-provided information,
shifting susceptibility from the assistant role to the user role. Furthermore,
we explore additional factors influencing misinformation susceptibility, such
as the role of the user in prompt structure, misinformation length, and the
presence of warnings in the system prompt. Our findings underscore the need for
systematic approaches to mitigate unintended consequences of instruction-tuning
and enhance the reliability of LLMs in real-world applications.

Conclusion: Prune&Comp为层剪枝提供了有效的即插即用补偿方案，在保持零运行时开销的同时显著提升现有剪枝方法的有效性。

Abstract: Layer pruning has emerged as a promising technique for compressing large
language models (LLMs) while achieving acceleration proportional to the pruning
ratio. In this work, we identify that removing any layer induces a significant
magnitude gap in hidden states, resulting in substantial performance
degradation. To address this issue, we propose Prune&Comp, a novel
plug-and-play layer pruning scheme that leverages magnitude compensation to
mitigate such gaps in a training-free manner. Specifically, we first estimate
the magnitude gap caused by layer removal and then eliminate this gap by
rescaling the remaining weights offline, with zero runtime overhead incurred.
We further demonstrate the advantages of Prune&Comp through an iterative
pruning strategy. When integrated with an iterative prune-and-compensate loop,
Prune&Comp consistently enhances existing layer pruning metrics. For instance,
when 5 layers of LLaMA-3-8B are pruned using the prevalent block influence
metric, Prune&Comp nearly halves the perplexity and retains 93.19\% of the
original model's question-answering performance, outperforming the baseline by
4.01%.

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现术语定位和多模态知识关联，在提升术语翻译效果的同时保持模型鲁棒性

Abstract: Direct speech translation (ST) has garnered increasing attention nowadays,
yet the accurate translation of terminology within utterances remains a great
challenge. In this regard, current studies mainly concentrate on leveraging
various translation knowledge into ST models. However, these methods often
struggle with interference from irrelevant noise and can not fully utilize the
translation knowledge. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a
novel Locate-and-Focus method for terminology translation. It first effectively
locates the speech clips containing terminologies within the utterance to
construct translation knowledge, minimizing irrelevant information for the ST
model. Subsequently, it associates the translation knowledge with the utterance
and hypothesis from both audio and textual modalities, allowing the ST model to
better focus on translation knowledge during translation. Experimental results
across various datasets demonstrate that our method effectively locates
terminologies within utterances and enhances the success rate of terminology
translation, while maintaining robust general translation performance.

Abstract: Solving the problem of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on printed text
for Latin and its derivative scripts can now be considered settled due to the
volumes of research done on English and other High-Resourced Languages (HRL).
However, for Low-Resourced Languages (LRL) that use unique scripts, it remains
an open problem. This study presents a comparative analysis of the zero-shot
performance of six distinct OCR engines on two LRLs: Sinhala and Tamil. The
selected engines include both commercial and open-source systems, aiming to
evaluate the strengths of each category. The Cloud Vision API, Surya, Document
AI, and Tesseract were evaluated for both Sinhala and Tamil, while Subasa OCR
and EasyOCR were examined for only one language due to their limitations. The
performance of these systems was rigorously analysed using five measurement
techniques to assess accuracy at both the character and word levels. According
to the findings, Surya delivered the best performance for Sinhala across all
metrics, with a WER of 2.61%. Conversely, Document AI excelled across all
metrics for Tamil, highlighted by a very low CER of 0.78%. In addition to the
above analysis, we also introduce a novel synthetic Tamil OCR benchmarking
dataset.

Abstract: Adapting LLMs to specific stylistic characteristics, like brand voice or
authorial tones, is crucial for enterprise communication but challenging to
achieve from corpora which lacks instruction-response formatting without
compromising instruction adherence. We introduce StyleAdaptedLM, a framework
that efficiently transfers stylistic traits to instruction-following models
using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). LoRA adapters are first trained on a base
model with diverse unstructured stylistic corpora, then merged with a separate
instruction-following model. This enables robust stylistic customization
without paired data or sacrificing task performance. Experiments across
multiple datasets and models demonstrate improved stylistic consistency while
preserving instruction adherence, with human evaluations confirming
brand-specific convention uptake. StyleAdaptedLM offers an efficient path for

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have emerged as a significant advancement in
artificial intelligence, representing a specialized class of large language
models (LLMs) designed to tackle complex reasoning tasks. The defining
characteristic of LRMs lies in their extensive chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
capabilities. In this paper, we identify a previously unexplored attack vector
against LRMs, which we term "overthinking backdoors". We advance this concept
by proposing a novel tunable backdoor, which moves beyond simple on/off attacks
to one where an attacker can precisely control the extent of the model's
reasoning verbosity. Our attack is implemented through a novel data poisoning
methodology. It pairs a tunable trigger-where the number of repetitions signals
the desired intensity-with a correspondingly verbose CoT response. These
responses are programmatically generated by instructing a teacher LLM to inject
a controlled number of redundant refinement steps into a correct reasoning
process. The approach preserves output correctness, which ensures stealth and
establishes the attack as a pure resource-consumption vector. Extensive
empirical results on various LRMs demonstrate that our method can reliably
trigger a controllable, multi-fold increase in the length of the reasoning
process, without degrading the final answer's correctness. Our source code is
available at https://github.com/FZaKK/BadReasoner.

TL;DR: 探讨机器翻译模型在性别不明确时的语义不确定性表现及去偏效果差异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器翻译模型在处理未明确标注性别的词汇时过度依赖刻板印象，需要研究模型在明确/模糊情境下的性别处理能力及去偏方法的差异化影响

Method: 采用语义不确定性量化指标，对比分析高准确率模型在明确翻译场景与模糊场景中的不确定性表现，并评估去偏处理对不同场景的独立影响

Result: 发现模型在明确场景的高准确率不必然伴随模糊场景的合理不确定性，且去偏处理对明确/模糊实例产生独立作用效果

Conclusion: 应同步提升模型在明确场景的准确性和模糊场景的不确定性表达能力，去偏策略需针对不同翻译场景分别设计

Abstract: In machine translation (MT), when the source sentence includes a lexeme whose
gender is not overtly marked, but whose target-language equivalent requires
gender specification, the model must infer the appropriate gender from the
context and/or external knowledge. Studies have shown that MT models exhibit
biased behaviour, relying on stereotypes even when they clash with contextual
information. We posit that apart from confidently translating using the correct
gender when it is evident from the input, models should also maintain
uncertainty about the gender when it is ambiguous. Using recently proposed
metrics of semantic uncertainty, we find that models with high translation and
gender accuracy on unambiguous instances do not necessarily exhibit the
expected level of uncertainty in ambiguous ones. Similarly, debiasing has
independent effects on ambiguous and unambiguous translation instances.

Motivation: 现有上下文学习方法面临两个核心挑战：(1)跨任务数据分布难以区分，(2)检索器输出与LLM反馈缺乏细粒度关联。传统方法在提升多任务场景下的示例检索质量方面存在局限

Method: 1. 任务解耦机制：在多任务数据集中分离不同任务的示例

Conclusion: TDR通过结构创新有效解决了上下文学习中的示例检索难题，为提升LLM的任务适应能力提供了新思路

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has become a classic approach for enabling LLMs to
handle various tasks based on a few input-output examples. The effectiveness of
ICL heavily relies on the quality of these examples, and previous works which
focused on enhancing example retrieval capabilities have achieved impressive
performances. However, two challenges remain in retrieving high-quality
examples: (1) Difficulty in distinguishing cross-task data distributions, (2)
Difficulty in making the fine-grained connection between retriever output and
feedback from LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called TDR. TDR
decouples the ICL examples from different tasks, which enables the retrieval
module to retrieve examples specific to the target task within a multi-task
dataset. Furthermore, TDR models fine-grained feedback from LLMs to supervise
and guide the training of the retrieval module, which helps to retrieve
high-quality examples. We conducted extensive experiments on a suite of 30 NLP
tasks, the results demonstrate that TDR consistently improved results across
all datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Meanwhile, our approach
is a plug-and-play method, which can be easily combined with various LLMs to
improve example retrieval abilities for ICL. The code is available at

Conclusion: 该框架为构建透明媒体生态系统提供技术支持，符合联合国可持续发展目标16（SDG 16），代码已开源

Abstract: Propaganda detection on social media remains challenging due to task
complexity and limited high-quality labeled data. This paper introduces a novel
framework that combines human expertise with Large Language Model (LLM)
assistance to improve both annotation consistency and scalability. We propose a
hierarchical taxonomy that organizes 14 fine-grained propaganda techniques into
three broader categories, conduct a human annotation study on the HQP dataset
that reveals low inter-annotator agreement for fine-grained labels, and
implement an LLM-assisted pre-annotation pipeline that extracts propagandistic
spans, generates concise explanations, and assigns local labels as well as a
global label. A secondary human verification study shows significant
improvements in both agreement and time-efficiency. Building on this, we
fine-tune smaller language models (SLMs) to perform structured annotation.
Instead of fine-tuning on human annotations, we train on high-quality
LLM-generated data, allowing a large model to produce these annotations and a
smaller model to learn to generate them via knowledge distillation. Our work
contributes towards the development of scalable and robust propaganda detection
systems, supporting the idea of transparent and accountable media ecosystems in
line with SDG 16. The code is publicly available at our GitHub repository.

Motivation: 现有LLM评估方法仅输出单一评分/排名，无法揭示模型性能背后的具体行为缺陷，制约了模型的针对性改进。

Method: 1. 生成实例级文本反馈
2. 聚类形成系统级错误问题集
3. 量化各错误类型发生率
4. 提供交互式看板（支持可视化分析、动态过滤和实例溯源）

Conclusion: CLEAR突破了传统评估的粗粒度局限，通过多层次错误解构和可视化交互，为模型改进提供了可操作的诊断依据。

Abstract: The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly relies on other
LLMs acting as judges. However, current evaluation paradigms typically yield a
single score or ranking, answering which model is better but not why. While
essential for benchmarking, these top-level scores obscure the specific,
actionable reasons behind a model's performance. To bridge this gap, we
introduce CLEAR, an interactive, open-source package for LLM-based error
analysis. CLEAR first generates per-instance textual feedback, then it creates
a set of system-level error issues, and quantifies the prevalence of each
identified issue. Our package also provides users with an interactive dashboard
that allows for a comprehensive error analysis through aggregate
visualizations, applies interactive filters to isolate specific issues or score
ranges, and drills down to the individual instances that exemplify a particular
behavioral pattern. We demonstrate CLEAR analysis for RAG and Math benchmarks,
and showcase its utility through a user case study.

Result: 建立多维度评估体系揭示结构化知识差异模式，量化跨语言表格内容对齐程度

Conclusion: 研究结果为事实核查提供方法论基础，指导构建跨语言知识交互系统及可靠AI训练数据架构

Abstract: Wikipedia serves as a globally accessible knowledge source with content in
over 300 languages. Despite covering the same topics, the different versions of
Wikipedia are written and updated independently. This leads to factual
inconsistencies that can impact the neutrality and reliability of the
encyclopedia and AI systems, which often rely on Wikipedia as a main training
source. This study investigates cross-lingual inconsistencies in Wikipedia's
structured content, with a focus on tabular data. We developed a methodology to
collect, align, and analyze tables from Wikipedia multilingual articles,
defining categories of inconsistency. We apply various quantitative and
qualitative metrics to assess multilingual alignment using a sample dataset.
These insights have implications for factual verification, multilingual
knowledge interaction, and design for reliable AI systems leveraging Wikipedia
content.

Conclusion: FinDPO首次实现情感分析与实际投资策略的有效整合，为金融NLP应用提供了新的技术范式与实证验证

Abstract: Opinions expressed in online finance-related textual data are having an
increasingly profound impact on trading decisions and market movements. This
trend highlights the vital role of sentiment analysis as a tool for quantifying
the nature and strength of such opinions. With the rapid development of
Generative AI (GenAI), supervised fine-tuned (SFT) large language models (LLMs)
have become the de facto standard for financial sentiment analysis. However,
the SFT paradigm can lead to memorization of the training data and often fails
to generalize to unseen samples. This is a critical limitation in financial
domains, where models must adapt to previously unobserved events and the
nuanced, domain-specific language of finance. To this end, we introduce FinDPO,
the first finance-specific LLM framework based on post-training human
preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The proposed
FinDPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard sentiment
classification benchmarks, outperforming existing supervised fine-tuned models
by 11% on the average. Uniquely, the FinDPO framework enables the integration
of a fine-tuned causal LLM into realistic portfolio strategies through a novel
'logit-to-score' conversion, which transforms discrete sentiment predictions
into continuous, rankable sentiment scores (probabilities). In this way,
simulations demonstrate that FinDPO is the first sentiment-based approach to
maintain substantial positive returns of 67% annually and strong risk-adjusted
performance, as indicated by a Sharpe ratio of 2.0, even under realistic
transaction costs of 5 basis points (bps).

Motivation: 填补阿拉伯语表格数据资源空白，解决现有大模型在非英语结构化数据处理中的性能瓶颈

Method: 采用LLM生成+人工验证的混合流程构建数据集，包含问答/事实验证/复杂推理等多任务评估体系

Result: 模型在简单问答表现尚可，但在深度推理任务（事实验证等）存在显著认知缺陷（准确率下降30-40%）

Conclusion: AraTable为阿拉伯语结构化数据处理提供首个系统性评估方案，自动化评估框架达到接近人工的评测效果

Abstract: The cognitive and reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) have
enabled remarkable progress in natural language processing. However, their
performance in interpreting structured data, especially in tabular formats,
remains limited. Although benchmarks for English tabular data are widely
available, Arabic is still underrepresented because of the limited availability
of public resources and its unique language features. To address this gap, we
present AraTable, a novel and comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
reasoning and understanding capabilities of LLMs when applied to Arabic tabular
data. AraTable consists of various evaluation tasks, such as direct question
answering, fact verification, and complex reasoning, involving a wide range of
Arabic tabular sources. Our methodology follows a hybrid pipeline, where
initial content is generated by LLMs and subsequently filtered and verified by
human experts to ensure high dataset quality. Initial analyses using AraTable
show that, while LLMs perform adequately on simpler tabular tasks such as
direct question answering, they continue to face significant cognitive
challenges when tasks require deeper reasoning and fact verification. This
indicates that there are substantial opportunities for future work to improve
performance on complex tabular reasoning tasks. We also propose a fully
automated evaluation framework that uses a self-deliberation mechanism and
achieves performance nearly identical to that of human judges. This research
provides a valuable, publicly available resource and evaluation framework that
can help accelerate the development of foundational models for processing and
analysing Arabic structured data.

Conclusion: 建立了孟加拉语标点恢复基准，公开数据集和代码促进低资源NLP研究发展

Abstract: Punctuation restoration enhances the readability of text and is critical for
post-processing tasks in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), especially for
low-resource languages like Bangla. In this study, we explore the application
of transformer-based models, specifically XLM-RoBERTa-large, to automatically
restore punctuation in unpunctuated Bangla text. We focus on predicting four
punctuation marks: period, comma, question mark, and exclamation mark across
diverse text domains. To address the scarcity of annotated resources, we
constructed a large, varied training corpus and applied data augmentation
techniques. Our best-performing model, trained with an augmentation factor of
alpha = 0.20%, achieves an accuracy of 97.1% on the News test set, 91.2% on the
Reference set, and 90.2% on the ASR set.
  Results show strong generalization to reference and ASR transcripts,
demonstrating the model's effectiveness in real-world, noisy scenarios. This
work establishes a strong baseline for Bangla punctuation restoration and
contributes publicly available datasets and code to support future research in
low-resource NLP.

Conclusion: 合成医学文本可作为真实数据的高效补充，但需加强隐私泄露风险评估。技术发展将加速医疗NLP工作流建设，规避数据共享法律限制。

Abstract: Generating clinical synthetic text represents an effective solution for
common clinical NLP issues like sparsity and privacy. This paper aims to
conduct a systematic review on generating synthetic medical free-text by
formulating quantitative analysis to three research questions concerning (i)
the purpose of generation, (ii) the techniques, and (iii) the evaluation
methods. We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE,
Google Scholar, and arXiv databases for publications associated with generating
synthetic medical unstructured free-text. We have identified 94 relevant
articles out of 1,398 collected ones. A great deal of attention has been given
to the generation of synthetic medical text from 2018 onwards, where the main
purpose of such a generation is towards text augmentation, assistive writing,
corpus building, privacy-preserving, annotation, and usefulness. Transformer
architectures were the main predominant technique used to generate the text,
especially the GPTs. On the other hand, there were four main aspects of
evaluation, including similarity, privacy, structure, and utility, where
utility was the most frequent method used to assess the generated synthetic
medical text. Although the generated synthetic medical text demonstrated a
moderate possibility to act as real medical documents in different downstream
NLP tasks, it has proven to be a great asset as augmented, complementary to the
real documents, towards improving the accuracy and overcoming
sparsity/undersampling issues. Yet, privacy is still a major issue behind
generating synthetic medical text, where more human assessments are needed to
check for the existence of any sensitive information. Despite that, advances in
generating synthetic medical text will considerably accelerate the adoption of
workflows and pipeline development, discarding the time-consuming legalities of
data transfer.

Result: 在复杂数据集上性能提升达12%，合成数据质量达到SOTA水平

Conclusion: 轻量级结构感知方法有效平衡了计算效率与数据质量，为LLMs表格建模提供实用解决方案

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong potential for tabular data
generation by modeling textualized feature-value pairs. However, tabular data
inherently exhibits sparse feature-level dependencies, where many feature
interactions are structurally insignificant. This creates a fundamental
mismatch as LLMs' self-attention mechanism inevitably distributes focus across
all pairs, diluting attention on critical relationships, particularly in
datasets with complex dependencies or semantically ambiguous features. To
address this limitation, we propose GraDe (Graph-Guided Dependency Learning), a
novel method that explicitly integrates sparse dependency graphs into LLMs'
attention mechanism. GraDe employs a lightweight dynamic graph learning module
guided by externally extracted functional dependencies, prioritizing key
feature interactions while suppressing irrelevant ones. Our experiments across
diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that GraDe outperforms existing
LLM-based approaches by up to 12% on complex datasets while achieving
competitive results with state-of-the-art approaches in synthetic data quality.
Our method is minimally intrusive yet effective, offering a practical solution
for structure-aware tabular data modeling with LLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) has demonstrated the significant help of
visual information in machine translation. However, existing MMT methods face
challenges in leveraging the modality gap by enforcing rigid visual-linguistic
alignment whilst being confined to inference within their trained multimodal
domains. In this work, we construct novel multimodal scene graphs to preserve
and integrate modality-specific information and introduce GIIFT, a two-stage
Graph-guided Inductive Image-Free MMT framework that uses a cross-modal Graph
Attention Network adapter to learn multimodal knowledge in a unified fused
space and inductively generalize it to broader image-free translation domains.
Experimental results on the Multi30K dataset of English-to-French and
English-to-German tasks demonstrate that our GIIFT surpasses existing
approaches and achieves the state-of-the-art, even without images during
inference. Results on the WMT benchmark show significant improvements over the
image-free translation baselines, demonstrating the strength of GIIFT towards
inductive image-free inference.

capturing local DNA sequence structures but often faces challenges, including
uneven token distribution and a limited understanding of global sequence
context. To address these limitations, we propose merging unique 6mer tokens
with optimally selected BPE tokens generated through 600 BPE cycles. This
hybrid approach ensures a balanced and context-aware vocabulary, enabling the
model to capture both short and long patterns within DNA sequences
simultaneously. A foundational DLM trained on this hybrid vocabulary was
evaluated using next-k-mer prediction as a fine-tuning task, demonstrating
significantly improved performance. The model achieved prediction accuracies of
10.78% for 3-mers, 10.1% for 4-mers, and 4.12% for 5-mers, outperforming
state-of-the-art models such as NT, DNABERT2, and GROVER. These results
highlight the ability of the hybrid tokenization strategy to preserve both the
local sequence structure and global contextual information in DNA modeling.
This work underscores the importance of advanced tokenization methods in
genomic language modeling and lays a robust foundation for future applications
in downstream DNA sequence analysis and biological research.

TL;DR: 提出WINO解码算法，通过并行草稿与验证机制，解决扩散大语言模型的质量-速度权衡问题，显著提升推理速度与准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散大语言模型（DLLMs）在加速并行解码时存在不可逆错误积累问题，导致性能显著下降。需设计可撤销的优化解码机制以突破质量-速度的权衡瓶颈。

Method: 采用训练无关的并行草稿-验证机制，主动生成多个候选token的同时利用双向上下文验证并重新掩码可疑结果，实现动态优化解码路径。

Result: 在GSM8K数学基准测试中实现6倍加速且准确率提升2.58%；在Flickr30K图像描述任务中获得10倍加速并保持更高生成质量。

Conclusion: WINO算法通过可撤销解码机制显著优化DLLMs的质量-速度平衡，实验验证其跨任务有效性，为高效并行生成模型提供新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have emerged as a compelling
alternative to Autoregressive models, designed for fast parallel generation.
However, existing DLLMs are plagued by a severe quality-speed trade-off, where
faster parallel decoding leads to significant performance degradation. We
attribute this to the irreversibility of standard decoding in DLLMs, which is
easily polarized into the wrong decoding direction along with early error
context accumulation. To resolve this, we introduce Wide-In, Narrow-Out (WINO),
a training-free decoding algorithm that enables revokable decoding in DLLMs.
WINO employs a parallel draft-and-verify mechanism, aggressively drafting
multiple tokens while simultaneously using the model's bidirectional context to
verify and re-mask suspicious ones for refinement. Verified in open-source
DLLMs like LLaDA and MMaDA, WINO is shown to decisively improve the
quality-speed trade-off. For instance, on the GSM8K math benchmark, it
accelerates inference by 6$\times$ while improving accuracy by 2.58%; on
Flickr30K captioning, it achieves a 10$\times$ speedup with higher performance.
More comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority and
provide an in-depth understanding of WINO.

Conclusion: AQuilt通过创新的数据构建框架，实现领域适配的高效低成本解决方案，开源资源促进相关研究发展

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) in general
domains, they often underperform in specialized domains. Existing approaches
typically rely on data synthesis methods and yield promising results by using
unlabeled data to capture domain-specific features. However, these methods
either incur high computational costs or suffer from performance limitations,
while also demonstrating insufficient generalization across different tasks. To
address these challenges, we propose AQuilt, a framework for constructing
instruction-tuning data for any specialized domains from corresponding
unlabeled data, including Answer, Question, Unlabeled data, Inspection, Logic,
and Task type. By incorporating logic and inspection, we encourage reasoning
processes and self-inspection to enhance model performance. Moreover,
customizable task instructions enable high-quality data generation for any
task. As a result, we construct a dataset of 703k examples to train a powerful
data synthesis model. Experiments show that AQuilt is comparable to DeepSeek-V3
while utilizing just 17% of the production cost. Further analysis demonstrates
that our generated data exhibits higher relevance to downstream tasks. Source

Motivation: 现有提示优化方法分为文本反馈和数值奖励训练两种路线，研究试图通过融合两种方法的优势并消除预训练数据集依赖来提升效果

Method: 将文本反馈直接整合到提示模型训练中，通过LLM对'好提示'的理解能力迭代优化生成过程

Result: 在GSMHard和MATH数学数据集上实现了最先进的查询特定提示生成效果

Conclusion: TRPrompt框架通过文本奖励信号和LLM的内在理解能力，展示了无需预训练数据的迭代式提示优化新范式

Abstract: Prompt optimization improves the reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs) without requiring parameter updates to the target model. Following
heuristic-based "Think step by step" approaches, the field has evolved in two
main directions: while one group of methods uses textual feedback to elicit
improved prompts from general-purpose LLMs in a training-free way, a concurrent
line of research relies on numerical rewards to train a special prompt model,
tailored for providing optimal prompts to the target model. In this paper, we
introduce the Textual Reward Prompt framework (TRPrompt), which unifies these
approaches by directly incorporating textual feedback into training of the
prompt model. Our framework does not require prior dataset collection and is
being iteratively improved with the feedback on the generated prompts. When
coupled with the capacity of an LLM to internalize the notion of what a "good"
prompt is, the high-resolution signal provided by the textual rewards allows us
to train a prompt model yielding state-of-the-art query-specific prompts for
the problems from the challenging math datasets GSMHard and MATH.

Motivation: 传统强化学习使用固定优化目标（如'帮助性'）限制模型适应能力，需建立更灵活的指令导向优化机制以适应多样化用户需求

Method: 从指令提取检查表→结合AI评估和验证器评分→生成强化学习奖励信号→应用于Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct模型

Result: 在FollowBench/InFoBench/Arena-Hard等五大基准测试中实现全面提升（硬满意度+4%，信息完整性+6%，对战胜率+3%）

Conclusion: 检查表反馈机制成为提升语言模型多需求响应能力的核心解决方案

Abstract: Language models must be adapted to understand and follow user instructions.
Reinforcement learning is widely used to facilitate this -- typically using
fixed criteria such as "helpfulness" and "harmfulness". In our work, we instead
propose using flexible, instruction-specific criteria as a means of broadening
the impact that reinforcement learning can have in eliciting instruction
following. We propose "Reinforcement Learning from Checklist Feedback" (RLCF).
From instructions, we extract checklists and evaluate how well responses
satisfy each item - using both AI judges and specialized verifier programs -
then combine these scores to compute rewards for RL. We compare RLCF with other
alignment methods applied to a strong instruction following model
(Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct) on five widely-studied benchmarks -- RLCF is the only
method to improve performance on every benchmark, including a 4-point boost in
hard satisfaction rate on FollowBench, a 6-point increase on InFoBench, and a
3-point rise in win rate on Arena-Hard. These results establish checklist
feedback as a key tool for improving language models' support of queries that
express a multitude of needs.

Result: 系统单次前传即可处理未见过动态概念，实验显示在跨领域主体和编辑场景下保持身份一致性和时间连贯性

Conclusion: 网格化适配器框架突破传统微调限制，实现高效可扩展的视频个性化，适用于开放域场景

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have enabled high-quality
synthesis from text and image prompts. While the personalization of dynamic
concepts, which capture subject-specific appearance and motion from a single
video, is now feasible, most existing methods require per-instance fine-tuning,
limiting scalability. We introduce a fully zero-shot framework for dynamic
concept personalization in text-to-video models. Our method leverages
structured 2x2 video grids that spatially organize input and output pairs,
enabling the training of lightweight Grid-LoRA adapters for editing and
composition within these grids. At inference, a dedicated Grid Fill module
completes partially observed layouts, producing temporally coherent and
identity preserving outputs. Once trained, the entire system operates in a
single forward pass, generalizing to previously unseen dynamic concepts without
any test-time optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate high-quality and
consistent results across a wide range of subjects beyond trained concepts and
editing scenarios.

Conclusion: GeoAvatar通过几何自适应机制、口腔运动解耦建模和精确绑定技术，突破了虚拟人生成中重建-动画的权衡难题

Abstract: Despite recent progress in 3D head avatar generation, balancing identity
preservation, i.e., reconstruction, with novel poses and expressions, i.e.,
animation, remains a challenge. Existing methods struggle to adapt Gaussians to
varying geometrical deviations across facial regions, resulting in suboptimal
quality. To address this, we propose GeoAvatar, a framework for adaptive
geometrical Gaussian Splatting. GeoAvatar leverages Adaptive Pre-allocation
Stage (APS), an unsupervised method that segments Gaussians into rigid and
flexible sets for adaptive offset regularization. Then, based on mouth anatomy
and dynamics, we introduce a novel mouth structure and the part-wise
deformation strategy to enhance the animation fidelity of the mouth. Finally,
we propose a regularization loss for precise rigging between Gaussians and 3DMM
faces. Moreover, we release DynamicFace, a video dataset with highly expressive
facial motions. Extensive experiments show the superiority of GeoAvatar
compared to state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction and novel animation
scenarios.

Result: 在合成/真实数据集上验证，重建精度和计算效率均超越现有方法

Conclusion: 该方法支持新视角合成、重光照和材质编辑，为三维重建提供高效解决方案

Abstract: Integrating inverse rendering with multi-view photometric stereo (MVPS)
yields more accurate 3D reconstructions than the inverse rendering approaches
that rely on fixed environment illumination. However, efficient inverse
rendering with MVPS remains challenging. To fill this gap, we introduce the
Gaussian Splatting for Multi-view Photometric Stereo (PS-GS), which efficiently
and jointly estimates the geometry, materials, and lighting of the object that
is illuminated by diverse directional lights (multi-light). Our method first
reconstructs a standard 2D Gaussian splatting model as the initial geometry.
Based on the initialization model, it then proceeds with the deferred inverse
rendering by the full rendering equation containing a lighting-computing
multi-layer perceptron. During the whole optimization, we regularize the
rendered normal maps by the uncalibrated photometric stereo estimated normals.
We also propose the 2D Gaussian ray-tracing for single directional light to
refine the incident lighting. The regularizations and the use of multi-view and
multi-light images mitigate the ill-posed problem of inverse rendering. After
optimization, the reconstructed object can be used for novel-view synthesis,
relighting, and material and shape editing. Experiments on both synthetic and
real datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms prior works in terms of
reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: 该技术实现了设备端实时推理，为游戏开发中模型驱动的逼真数字角色奠定基础

Abstract: The training of high-quality, robust machine learning models for
speech-driven 3D facial animation requires a large, diverse dataset of
high-quality audio-animation pairs. To overcome the lack of such a dataset,
recent work has introduced large pre-trained speech encoders that are robust to
variations in the input audio and, therefore, enable the facial animation model
to generalize across speakers, audio quality, and languages. However, the
resulting facial animation models are prohibitively large and lend themselves
only to offline inference on a dedicated machine. In this work, we explore
on-device, real-time facial animation models in the context of game
development. We overcome the lack of large datasets by using hybrid knowledge
distillation with pseudo-labeling. Given a large audio dataset, we employ a
high-performing teacher model to train very small student models. In contrast
to the pre-trained speech encoders, our student models only consist of
convolutional and fully-connected layers, removing the need for attention
context or recurrent updates. In our experiments, we demonstrate that we can
reduce the memory footprint to up to 3.4 MB and required future audio context
to up to 81 ms while maintaining high-quality animations. This paves the way
for on-device inference, an important step towards realistic, model-driven
digital characters.

Abstract: Generative reward models with parallel sampling have enabled effective
test-time scaling for reasoning tasks. Current approaches employ pointwise
scoring of individual solutions or pairwise comparisons. However, pointwise
methods underutilize LLMs' comparative abilities, while pairwise methods scale
inefficiently with larger sampling budgets. We introduce GenSelect, where the
LLM uses long reasoning to select the best solution among N candidates. This
leverages LLMs' comparative strengths while scaling efficiently across parallel
sampling budgets. For math reasoning, we demonstrate that reasoning models,
such as QwQ and DeepSeek-R1-0528, excel at GenSelect, outperforming existing

Result: 在四个PCR基准数据集上验证，LLM模型优于BM25和监督式Transformer模型

Conclusion: LLM嵌入模型有效解决了PCR中的关键挑战，为法律信息检索提供了新方向

Abstract: In common law systems, legal professionals such as lawyers and judges rely on
precedents to build their arguments. As the volume of cases has grown massively
over time, effectively retrieving prior cases has become essential. Prior case
retrieval (PCR) is an information retrieval (IR) task that aims to
automatically identify the most relevant court cases for a specific query from
a large pool of potential candidates. While IR methods have seen several
paradigm shifts over the last few years, the vast majority of PCR methods
continue to rely on traditional IR methods, such as BM25. The state-of-the-art
deep learning IR methods have not been successful in PCR due to two key
challenges: i. Lengthy legal text limitation; when using the powerful
BERT-based transformer models, there is a limit of input text lengths, which
inevitably requires to shorten the input via truncation or division with a loss
of legal context information. ii. Lack of legal training data; due to data
privacy concerns, available PCR datasets are often limited in size, making it
difficult to train deep learning-based models effectively. In this research, we
address these challenges by leveraging LLM-based text embedders in PCR.
LLM-based embedders support longer input lengths, and since we use them in an
unsupervised manner, they do not require training data, addressing both
challenges simultaneously. In this paper, we evaluate state-of-the-art
LLM-based text embedders in four PCR benchmark datasets and show that they
outperform BM25 and supervised transformer-based models.

Conclusion: DR.EHR通过系统化知识注入和数据生成方案，为临床应用提供了鲁棒的电子病历检索解决方案

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are pivotal in clinical practices, yet their
retrieval remains a challenge mainly due to semantic gap issues. Recent
advancements in dense retrieval offer promising solutions but existing models,
both general-domain and biomedical-domain, fall short due to insufficient
medical knowledge or mismatched training corpora. This paper introduces
\texttt{DR.EHR}, a series of dense retrieval models specifically tailored for
EHR retrieval. We propose a two-stage training pipeline utilizing MIMIC-IV
discharge summaries to address the need for extensive medical knowledge and
large-scale training data. The first stage involves medical entity extraction
and knowledge injection from a biomedical knowledge graph, while the second
stage employs large language models to generate diverse training data. We train
two variants of \texttt{DR.EHR}, with 110M and 7B parameters, respectively.
Evaluated on the CliniQ benchmark, our models significantly outperforms all
existing dense retrievers, achieving state-of-the-art results. Detailed
analyses confirm our models' superiority across various match and query types,
particularly in challenging semantic matches like implication and abbreviation.
Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each pipeline component, and
supplementary experiments on EHR QA datasets demonstrate the models'
generalizability on natural language questions, including complex ones with
multiple entities. This work significantly advances EHR retrieval, offering a
robust solution for clinical applications.

Conclusion: 语音提示可解锁记忆的视听内容，暴露多模态生成系统在版权、安全和内容溯源的重大风险，需重新评估现代生成系统的安全架构

Abstract: Lyrics-to-Song (LS2) generation models promise end-to-end music synthesis
from text, yet their vulnerability to training data memorization remains
underexplored. We introduce Adversarial PhoneTic Prompting (APT), a novel
attack where lyrics are semantically altered while preserving their acoustic
structure through homophonic substitutions (e.g., Eminem's famous "mom's
spaghetti" $\rightarrow$ "Bob's confetti"). Despite these distortions, we
uncover a powerful form of sub-lexical memorization: models like SUNO and YuE
regenerate outputs strikingly similar to known training content, achieving high
similarity across audio-domain metrics, including CLAP, AudioJudge, and
CoverID. This vulnerability persists across multiple languages and genres. More
surprisingly, we discover that phoneme-altered lyrics alone can trigger visual
memorization in text-to-video models. When prompted with phonetically modified
lyrics from Lose Yourself, Veo 3 reconstructs visual elements from the original
music video -- including character appearance and scene composition -- despite
no visual cues in the prompt. We term this phenomenon phonetic-to-visual
regurgitation. Together, these findings expose a critical vulnerability in
transcript-conditioned multimodal generation: phonetic prompting alone can
unlock memorized audiovisual content, raising urgent questions about copyright,
safety, and content provenance in modern generative systems. Example
generations are available on our demo page (jrohsc.github.io/music_attack/).

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: CHiME-7/8挑战聚焦多通道语音识别与说话人日志任务，分析参赛系统发现：端到端模型成为主流，分离技术仍依赖传统方法，说话人计数准确性是关键，大语言模型削弱了转录质量与下游任务关联性，复杂场景语音识别仍具挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推动复杂声学环境下对话语音的自动识别与说话人日志技术发展，通过分析32个参赛系统的技术趋势，揭示领域最新进展与现存瓶颈。

Method: 通过CHiME-7/8挑战赛框架设计（含数据集、评估指标、基线系统），对9个团队提交的32个系统进行多维度技术分析，重点关注端到端ASR、语音分离、说话人日志优化等方向。

Result: 1. 端到端ASR因预训练模型普及取代混合系统
2. 语音分离仍依赖传统引导式方法而非纯神经方案
3. 最佳系统均采用基于目标说话人日志的优化策略
4. 大语言模型使会议摘要任务与转录质量关联性减弱
5. 复杂场景下自发语音识别错误率仍高达50%以上

Conclusion: 挑战赛显示：当前神经语音分离技术可靠性不足，精准说话人计数是日志优化的关键，大语言模型虽提升容错性但未解决核心识别难题，复杂声学环境下的语音识别仍需突破性进展。

Abstract: The CHiME-7 and 8 distant speech recognition (DASR) challenges focus on
multi-channel, generalizable, joint automatic speech recognition (ASR) and
diarization of conversational speech. With participation from 9 teams
submitting 32 diverse systems, these challenges have contributed to
state-of-the-art research in the field. This paper outlines the challenges'
design, evaluation metrics, datasets, and baseline systems while analyzing key
trends from participant submissions. From this analysis it emerges that: 1)
Most participants use end-to-end (e2e) ASR systems, whereas hybrid systems were
prevalent in previous CHiME challenges. This transition is mainly due to the
availability of robust large-scale pre-trained models, which lowers the data
burden for e2e-ASR. 2) Despite recent advances in neural speech separation and
enhancement (SSE), all teams still heavily rely on guided source separation,
suggesting that current neural SSE techniques are still unable to reliably deal
with complex scenarios and different recording setups. 3) All best systems
employ diarization refinement via target-speaker diarization techniques.
Accurate speaker counting in the first diarization pass is thus crucial to
avoid compounding errors and CHiME-8 DASR participants especially focused on
this part. 4) Downstream evaluation via meeting summarization can correlate
weakly with transcription quality due to the remarkable effectiveness of
large-language models in handling errors. On the NOTSOFAR-1 scenario, even
systems with over 50\% time-constrained minimum permutation WER can perform
roughly on par with the most effective ones (around 11\%). 5) Despite recent
progress, accurately transcribing spontaneous speech in challenging acoustic
environments remains difficult, even when using computationally intensive
system ensembles.

Motivation: 解决传统流固耦合模拟中流体通过薄壁结构泄漏的问题，特别是针对超薄可变形结构保持流体域路径连通性的挑战

Method: 结合约束Voronoi空间分割与Godunov有限体积法，构建严格符合流固界面的网格，实现精确的边界条件处理和直接力交换

Result: 在压缩空气驱动气球、香槟塞弹射和超音速小行星等场景验证了方法的可靠性，成功展示双向能量传递过程

Conclusion: 该方法突破传统泄漏限制，为薄壁结构流固耦合问题提供有效解决方案，在工程仿真领域具有广泛应用前景

Abstract: We present a novel discretization of coupled compressible fluid and thin
deformable structures that provides sufficient and necessary leakproofness by
preserving the path connectedness of the fluid domain. Our method employs a
constrained Voronoi-based spatial partitioning combined with Godunov-style
finite-volume time integration. The fluid domain is discretized into cells that
conform exactly to the fluid-solid interface, allowing boundary conditions to
be sharply resolved exactly at the interface. This enables direct force
exchange between the fluid and solid while ensuring that no fluid leaks through
the solid, even when arbitrarily thin. We validate our approach on a series of
challenging scenarios -- including a balloon propelled by internal compressed
air, a champagne cork ejecting after overcoming friction, and a supersonic
asteroid -- demonstrating bidirectional energy transfer between fluid and
solid.

<details>

Motivation: 解决医疗AI部署中预处理流程碎片化、模型兼容性差、数据隐私要求严格导致的实施成本高问题

Method: 1. 模块化代理系统处理结构化和非结构化数据
2. 自动特征匹配（嵌入方法处理表格数据/MedGemma处理图像）

Conclusion: 该框架显著减少临床AI落地对专家资源的依赖，为医疗场景提供标准化、可扩展的ML运维方案

Abstract: Building and deploying machine learning solutions in healthcare remains
expensive and labor-intensive due to fragmented preprocessing workflows, model
compatibility issues, and stringent data privacy constraints. In this work, we
introduce an Agentic AI framework that automates the entire clinical data
pipeline, from ingestion to inference, through a system of modular,
task-specific agents. These agents handle both structured and unstructured
data, enabling automatic feature selection, model selection, and preprocessing
recommendation without manual intervention. We evaluate the system on publicly
available datasets from geriatrics, palliative care, and colonoscopy imaging.
For example, in the case of structured data (anxiety data) and unstructured
data (colonoscopy polyps data), the pipeline begins with file-type detection by
the Ingestion Identifier Agent, followed by the Data Anonymizer Agent ensuring
privacy compliance, where we first identify the data type and then anonymize
it. The Feature Extraction Agent identifies features using an embedding-based
approach for tabular data, extracting all column names, and a multi-stage
MedGemma-based approach for image data, which infers modality and disease name.
These features guide the Model-Data Feature Matcher Agent in selecting the
best-fit model from a curated repository. The Preprocessing Recommender Agent
and Preprocessing Implementor Agent then apply tailored preprocessing based on
data type and model requirements. Finally, the ``Model Inference Agent" runs
the selected model on the uploaded data and generates interpretable outputs
using tools like SHAP, LIME, and DETR attention maps. By automating these
high-friction stages of the ML lifecycle, the proposed framework reduces the
need for repeated expert intervention, offering a scalable, cost-efficient
pathway for operationalizing AI in clinical environments.

Motivation: 现有对齐方法（如RLHF）仅学习人类偏好，缺乏内在安全推理能力，需建立系统化框架实现安全与能力的共同提升

Method: 基于多原则验证器的大规模渐进式强化学习后训练（SafeLadder框架），结合推理时干预机制和审慎搜索实现步骤级验证

Result: 安全基准平均提升46.54%（对比Qwen2.5-VL-72B），超越GPT-4.1/Claude Opus，成功扩展至78B/70B/7B不同规模模型

Conclusion: 安全与能力可协同进化，SafeLadder框架具有通用性，为构建可靠通用AI提供系统化解决方案

Abstract: We introduce SafeWork-R1, a cutting-edge multimodal reasoning model that
demonstrates the coevolution of capabilities and safety. It is developed by our
proposed SafeLadder framework, which incorporates large-scale, progressive,
safety-oriented reinforcement learning post-training, supported by a suite of
multi-principled verifiers. Unlike previous alignment methods such as RLHF that
simply learn human preferences, SafeLadder enables SafeWork-R1 to develop
intrinsic safety reasoning and self-reflection abilities, giving rise to safety
`aha' moments. Notably, SafeWork-R1 achieves an average improvement of
$46.54\%$ over its base model Qwen2.5-VL-72B on safety-related benchmarks
without compromising general capabilities, and delivers state-of-the-art safety
performance compared to leading proprietary models such as GPT-4.1 and Claude
Opus 4. To further bolster its reliability, we implement two distinct
inference-time intervention methods and a deliberative search mechanism,
enforcing step-level verification. Finally, we further develop
SafeWork-R1-InternVL3-78B, SafeWork-R1-DeepSeek-70B, and
SafeWork-R1-Qwen2.5VL-7B. All resulting models demonstrate that safety and
capability can co-evolve synergistically, highlighting the generalizability of
our framework in building robust, reliable, and trustworthy general-purpose AI.

Method: 使用GPT-4o构建双代理数学解题环境，测试师生互动/同伴协作/互惠教学/批判辩论四种模式，基于MATH数据集评估

Result: 双代理准确率超越单代理（同伴协作达最高），关键对话行为包含陈述/确认/提示

Conclusion: 多代理框架提升教育AI任务性能，但需配合有效沟通策略应对复杂问题

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly utilized in AI-aided
education to support tutoring and learning. Effective communication strategies
among LLM agents improve collaborative problem-solving efficiency and
facilitate cost-effective adoption in education. However, little research has
systematically evaluated the impact of different communication strategies on
agents' problem-solving. Our study examines four communication modes,
\textit{teacher-student interaction}, \textit{peer-to-peer collaboration},
\textit{reciprocal peer teaching}, and \textit{critical debate}, in a
dual-agent, chat-based mathematical problem-solving environment using the
OpenAI GPT-4o model. Evaluated on the MATH dataset, our results show that
dual-agent setups outperform single agents, with \textit{peer-to-peer
collaboration} achieving the highest accuracy. Dialogue acts like statements,
acknowledgment, and hints play a key role in collaborative problem-solving.
While multi-agent frameworks enhance computational tasks, effective
communication strategies are essential for tackling complex problems in AI
education.

Conclusion: AI画像代理系统能有效整合多元观点，作为设计原型工具显著提升反馈收集与决策效率

Abstract: Poster designing can benefit from synchronous feedback from target audiences.
However, gathering audiences with diverse perspectives and reconciling them on
design edits can be challenging. Recent generative AI models present
opportunities to simulate human-like interactions, but it is unclear how they
may be used for feedback processes in design. We introduce PosterMate, a poster
design assistant that facilitates collaboration by creating audience-driven
persona agents constructed from marketing documents. PosterMate gathers
feedback from each persona agent regarding poster components, and stimulates
discussion with the help of a moderator to reach a conclusion. These
agreed-upon edits can then be directly integrated into the poster design.
Through our user study (N=12), we identified the potential of PosterMate to
capture overlooked viewpoints, while serving as an effective prototyping tool.
Additionally, our controlled online evaluation (N=100) revealed that the
feedback from an individual persona agent is appropriate given its persona
identity, and the discussion effectively synthesizes the different persona
agents' perspectives.

Motivation: 当前主流多模态模型架构落后于语言模型的技术发展，需要将LLMs中的先进架构组件引入视觉-语言模型

Method: 在CoCa的文本解码器和ViT编码器中集成三种改进：高斯误差门控线性单元、均方根归一化、旋转位置编码

Result: 预训练阶段对比损失降低27.25%，生成困惑度提升3.71%；微调阶段平均对比损失提升13.66%，模型在跨领域任务中展现更强泛化能力

Conclusion: GRR-CoCA验证了LLMs架构改进对多模态模型的有效性，为视觉-语言模型架构创新提供了新方向

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) image and text generation models are multimodal
models that have many similarities to large language models (LLMs). Despite
achieving strong performances, leading foundational multimodal model
architectures frequently lag behind the architectural sophistication of
contemporary LLMs. We propose GRR-CoCa, an improved SOTA Contrastive Captioner
(CoCa) model that incorporates Gaussian error gated linear units, root mean
squared normalization, and rotary positional embedding into the textual
decoders and the vision transformer (ViT) encoder. Each architectural
modification has been shown to improve model performance in LLMs, but has yet
to be adopted in CoCa. We benchmarked GRR-CoCa against Baseline CoCa, a model
with the same modified textual decoders but with CoCa's original ViT encoder.
We used standard pretraining and fine-tuning workflows to benchmark the models
on contrastive and generative tasks. Our GRR-CoCa significantly outperformed
Baseline CoCa on the pretraining dataset and three diverse fine-tuning
datasets. Pretraining improvements were 27.25% in contrastive loss, 3.71% in
perplexity, and 7.15% in CoCa loss. The average fine-tuning improvements were
13.66% in contrastive loss, 5.18% in perplexity, and 5.55% in CoCa loss. We
show that GRR-CoCa's modified architecture improves performance and
generalization across vision-language domains.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型生成的合成数据存在图像与标题语义不匹配（如缺失对象、属性错误），导致训练噪声。传统数据清洗方法针对文本噪声设计，无法有效处理合成图像质量问题。

Method: 采用一对多映射策略：1) 为每个标题检索多个候选图像；2) 通过循环一致性对齐评分器选择最佳图像（验证图像是否能通过跨模态检索还原原标题）。

Result: 在MS-COCO、Flickr30k、NoCaps等基准测试中显著提升各类ZIC模型性能，部分场景达到SOTA。

Conclusion: SynC提供了一种通过优化合成数据对齐质量来增强零样本图像描述任务的有效策略，且无需重新生成图像资源。

Abstract: Zero-shot Image Captioning (ZIC) increasingly utilizes synthetic datasets
generated by text-to-image (T2I) models to mitigate the need for costly manual
annotation. However, these T2I models often produce images that exhibit
semantic misalignments with their corresponding input captions (e.g., missing
objects, incorrect attributes), resulting in noisy synthetic image-caption
pairs that can hinder model training. Existing dataset pruning techniques are
largely designed for removing noisy text in web-crawled data. However, these
methods are ill-suited for the distinct challenges of synthetic data, where
captions are typically well-formed, but images may be inaccurate
representations. To address this gap, we introduce SynC, a novel framework
specifically designed to refine synthetic image-caption datasets for ZIC.
Instead of conventional filtering or regeneration, SynC focuses on reassigning
captions to the most semantically aligned images already present within the
synthetic image pool. Our approach employs a one-to-many mapping strategy by
initially retrieving multiple relevant candidate images for each caption. We
then apply a cycle-consistency-inspired alignment scorer that selects the best
image by verifying its ability to retrieve the original caption via
image-to-text retrieval. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SynC
consistently and significantly improves performance across various ZIC models
on standard benchmarks (MS-COCO, Flickr30k, NoCaps), achieving state-of-the-art
results in several scenarios. SynC offers an effective strategy for curating
refined synthetic data to enhance ZIC.

Conclusion: 暴露LVLMs安全脆弱性，建立红队测试框架，为未来防御技术开发提供基准

Abstract: Resource Consumption Attacks (RCAs) have emerged as a significant threat to
the deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). With the integration of vision
modalities, additional attack vectors exacerbate the risk of RCAs in large
vision-language models (LVLMs). However, existing red-teaming studies have
largely overlooked visual inputs as a potential attack surface, resulting in
insufficient mitigation strategies against RCAs in LVLMs. To address this gap,
we propose RECALLED (\textbf{RE}source \textbf{C}onsumption \textbf{A}ttack on
\textbf{L}arge Vision-\textbf{L}anguag\textbf{E} Mo\textbf{D}els), the first
approach for exploiting visual modalities to trigger unbounded RCAs
red-teaming. First, we present \textit{Vision Guided Optimization}, a
fine-grained pixel-level optimization, to obtain \textit{Output Recall}
adversarial perturbations, which can induce repeating output. Then, we inject
the perturbations into visual inputs, triggering unbounded generations to
achieve the goal of RCAs. Additionally, we introduce \textit{Multi-Objective
Parallel Losses} to generate universal attack templates and resolve
optimization conflicts when intending to implement parallel attacks. Empirical
results demonstrate that RECALLED increases service response latency by over 26
$\uparrow$, resulting in an additional 20\% increase in GPU utilization and
memory consumption. Our study exposes security vulnerabilities in LVLMs and
establishes a red-teaming framework that can facilitate future defense
development against RCAs.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) typically adhere to a "pre-training and fine-tuning"
paradigm, where a universal pre-trained model can be fine-tuned to cater to
various specialized domains. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained the most
widespread use in LM fine-tuning due to its lightweight computational cost and
remarkable performance. Because the proportion of parameters tuned by LoRA is
relatively small, there might be a misleading impression that the LoRA
fine-tuning data is invulnerable to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs).
However, we identify that utilizing the pre-trained model can induce more
information leakage, which is neglected by existing MIAs. Therefore, we
introduce LoRA-Leak, a holistic evaluation framework for MIAs against the
fine-tuning datasets of LMs. LoRA-Leak incorporates fifteen membership
inference attacks, including ten existing MIAs, and five improved MIAs that
leverage the pre-trained model as a reference. In experiments, we apply
LoRA-Leak to three advanced LMs across three popular natural language
processing tasks, demonstrating that LoRA-based fine-tuned LMs are still
vulnerable to MIAs (e.g., 0.775 AUC under conservative fine-tuning settings).
We also applied LoRA-Leak to different fine-tuning settings to understand the
resulting privacy risks. We further explore four defenses and find that only
dropout and excluding specific LM layers during fine-tuning effectively
mitigate MIA risks while maintaining utility. We highlight that under the
"pre-training and fine-tuning" paradigm, the existence of the pre-trained model
makes MIA a more severe risk for LoRA-based LMs. We hope that our findings can
provide guidance on data privacy protection for specialized LM providers.
