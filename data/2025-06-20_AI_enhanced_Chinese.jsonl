The dataset includes 14 clinically significant AEs-such as falls, delirium, and intracranial haemorrhage, along with contextual attributes like negation, diagnosis type, and in-hospital occurrence. Uniquely, the annotation schema supports both discontinuous and overlapping entities, addressing challenges rarely tackled in prior work. We evaluate multiple models using FlairNLP across three annotation granularities: fine-grained, coarse-grained, and coarse-grained with negation. While transformer-based models (e.g., BERT-cased) achieve strong performance on document-level coarse-grained extraction (F1 = 0.943), performance drops notably for fine-grained entity-level tasks (e.g., F1 = 0.675), particularly for rare events and complex attributes. These results demonstrate that despite high-level scores, significant challenges remain in detecting underrepresented AEs and capturing nuanced clinical language.

This is advantageous as it allows for dynamic constraints without requiring retraining, but can lead to low-quality output during constrained decoding at test time. We overcome this problem with Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD), which combines constrained and unconstrained decoding in two phases: Phase 1 decodes from the base model $M$ twice, in constrained and unconstrained mode, obtaining two weak predictions. In phase 2, a learned autoregressive boosted model combines the two weak predictions into one final prediction. The mistakes made by the base model with vs. without constraints tend to be complementary, which the boosted model learns to exploit for improved performance.

However, existing methods often overlook a critical challenge: the credibility of context documents can vary widely, potentially leading to the propagation of unreliable information. In this paper, we introduce CrEst, a novel weakly supervised framework for assessing the credibility of context documents during LLM inference--without requiring manual annotations. Our approach is grounded in the insight that credible documents tend to exhibit higher semantic coherence with other credible documents, enabling automated credibility estimation through inter-document agreement. To incorporate credibility into LLM inference, we propose two integration strategies: a black-box approach for models without access to internal weights or activations, and a white-box method that directly modifies attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments across three model architectures and five datasets demonstrate that CrEst consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to a 26.86% improvement in accuracy and a 3.49% increase in F1 score.

New evaluation benchmarks are of increasing priority as the reasoning capabilities of LLMs are expanding at a rapid pace. In particular, while multi-document (MD) reasoning is an area of extreme relevance given LLM capabilities in handling longer-context inputs, few benchmarks exist to rigorously examine model behavior in this setting. Moreover, the multi-document setting is historically challenging for benchmark creation due to the expensive cost of annotating long inputs. In this work, we introduce MDBench, a new dataset for evaluating LLMs on the task of multi-document reasoning. Notably, MDBench is created through a novel synthetic generation process, allowing us to controllably and efficiently generate challenging document sets and the corresponding question-answer (QA) examples. Our novel technique operates on condensed structured seed knowledge, modifying it through LLM-assisted edits to induce MD-specific reasoning challenges. We then convert this structured knowledge into a natural text surface form, generating a document set and corresponding QA example. We analyze the behavior of popular LLMs and prompting techniques, finding that MDBENCH poses significant challenges for all methods, even with relatively short document sets.

We developed transformer-based diffusion models to synthesize loose IMU data and estimate human poses based on this challenging loose IMU data. In addition, we show that incorporating garment-related parameters while training the model on simulated loose data effectively maintains expressiveness and enhances the ability to capture variations introduced by looser or tighter garments. Experiments show that our proposed diffusion methods trained on simulated and synthetic data outperformed the state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively, opening up a promising direction for future research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u677e\u6563IMU\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Transformer\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u670d\u88c5\u53c2\u6570\u878d\u5408\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u60ef\u6027\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u52a8\u4f5c\u6355\u6349\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7d27\u5bc6\u8d34\u5408\u8eab\u4f53\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5e38\u5b58\u5728\u677e\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u7684\u677e\u6563\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u5f00\u5c55\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "1. \u4ece\u670d\u88c5\u611f\u77e5\u8fd0\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6a21\u62df\u677e\u6563IMU\u6570\u636e\n2. \u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u548c\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\n3. \u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u878d\u5165\u670d\u88c5\u76f8\u5173\u53c2\u6570\u4fdd\u6301\u8868\u73b0\u529b", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df/\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b9a\u91cf\u5b9a\u6027\u8d85\u8d8aSOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u670d\u88c5\u53c2\u6570\u878d\u5408\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u670d\u88c5\u677e\u7d27\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u677e\u6563IMU\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u5f00\u8f9f\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u670d\u88c5\u53c2\u6570\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u5177\u6709\u63a8\u5e7f\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u4eff\u771f\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u771f\u5b9e\u6027"}}

We conduct an empirical analysis using the Pima Indian Diabetes Database (PIDD). We evaluate six LLMs, including four open-source models: Gemma-2-27B, Mistral-7B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.2-2B. We also test two proprietary models: GPT-4o and Gemini Flash 2.0. In addition, we compare their performance with three traditional machine learning models: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We use accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score as evaluation metrics. Our results show that proprietary LLMs perform better than open-source ones, with GPT-4o and Gemma-2-27B achieving the highest accuracy in few-shot settings. Notably, Gemma-2-27B also outperforms the traditional ML models in terms of F1-score.

Existing face sketch synthesis research mainly relies on training with numerous photo-sketch sample pairs from existing datasets. However, these large-scale discriminative learning methods will have to face problems such as data scarcity and high human labor costs. Once the training data becomes scarce, their generative performance significantly degrades. In this paper, we propose a one-shot face sketch synthesis method based on diffusion models. We optimize text instructions on a diffusion model using face photo-sketch image pairs. Then, the instructions derived through gradient-based optimization are used for inference. To simulate real-world scenarios more accurately and evaluate method effectiveness more comprehensively, we introduce a new benchmark named One-shot Face Sketch Dataset (OS-Sketch). The benchmark consists of 400 pairs of face photo-sketch images, including sketches with different styles and photos with different backgrounds, ages, sexes, expressions, illumination, etc. For a solid out-of-distribution evaluation, we select only one pair of images for training at each time, with the rest used for inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can convert various photos into realistic and highly consistent sketches in a one-shot context. Compared to other methods, our approach offers greater convenience and broader applicability.

We evaluate this phenomenon across English and Spanish datasets, sequences of up to approximately 240 tokens, and model scales ranging from 100M to 8B parameters.

Although state-of-the-art generative models, such as diffusion models, have made significant progress in 3D generation, they often fall short of human-designed content due to limited ability to follow instructions, align with human preferences, or produce realistic textures, geometries, and physical attributes. In this paper, we introduce Nabla-R2D3, a highly effective and sample-efficient reinforcement learning alignment framework for 3D-native diffusion models using 2D rewards. Built upon the recently proposed Nabla-GFlowNet method, which matches the score function to reward gradients in a principled manner for reward finetuning, our Nabla-R2D3 enables effective adaptation of 3D diffusion models using only 2D reward signals. Extensive experiments show that, unlike vanilla finetuning baselines which either struggle to converge or suffer from reward hacking, Nabla-R2D3 consistently achieves higher rewards and reduced prior forgetting within a few finetuning steps.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faNabla-R2D3\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc72D\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u9ad8\u6548\u4f18\u53163D\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d3D\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u56f0\u96be\u3001\u7eb9\u7406/\u51e0\u4f55\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u6b20\u7f3a\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5339\u654c\u4eba\u9020\u5185\u5bb9\u8d28\u91cf", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eNabla-GFlowNet\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u5c06\u5206\u6570\u51fd\u6570\u4e0e\u5956\u52b1\u68af\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb3D\u539f\u751f\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u5fae\u8c03\u6b65\u9aa4\u5185\u5373\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u5956\u52b1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u5956\u52b1\u52ab\u6301\u548c\u5148\u9a8c\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898", "conclusion": "Nabla-R2D3\u4e3a\u4ec5\u4f7f\u75282D\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f18\u53163D\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u8c03\u57fa\u7ebf"}}

We present MicroRicci, the first truly self-tuning, local Ricci-flow solver that borrows ideas from coding theory and packs them into just 1K + 200 parameters. Its primary core is a greedy syndrome-decoding step that pinpoints and corrects the largest curvature error in O(E) time, augmented by two tiny neural modules that adaptively choose vertices and step sizes on the fly. On a diverse set of 110 SJTU-TMQA meshes, MicroRicci slashes iteration counts from 950+=140 to 400+=80 (2.4x speedup), tightens curvature spread from 0.19 to 0.185, and achieves a remarkable UV-distortion-to-MOS correlation of r = -0.93. It adds only 0.25 ms per iteration (0.80 to 1.05 ms), yielding an end-to-end 1.8x runtime acceleration over state-of-the-art methods.

Existing methods often miss key aspects like coherence, style, or relevance, or are biased by pretraining data, making open-ended long-form evaluation an underexplored problem. To address this gap, we propose PrefBERT, a scoring model for evaluating open-ended long-form generation in GRPO and guiding its training with distinct rewards for good and bad outputs. Trained on two response evaluation datasets with diverse long-form styles and Likert-rated quality, PrefBERT effectively supports GRPO by offering better semantic reward feedback than traditional metrics ROUGE-L and BERTScore do. Through comprehensive evaluations, including LLM-as-a-judge, human ratings, and qualitative analysis, we show that PrefBERT, trained on multi-sentence and paragraph-length responses, remains reliable across varied long passages and aligns well with the verifiable rewards GRPO needs. Human evaluations confirm that using PrefBERT as the reward signal to train policy models yields responses better aligned with human preferences than those trained with traditional metrics.

In this work, we empirically investigate how learning-time choices in knowledge encoding impact the effectiveness of unlearning factual knowledge. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1) learning with paraphrased descriptions improves unlearning performance and (2) unlearning individual piece of knowledge from a chunk of text is challenging. Our results suggest that learning-time knowledge encoding may play a central role in enabling reliable post-hoc unlearning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5b66\u4e60\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u5f0f\uff08\u5982\u4f7f\u7528\u8f6c\u8ff0\u63cf\u8ff0\uff09\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e8b\u540e\u53cd\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e2a\u4f53\u77e5\u8bc6\u5757\u7684\u53cd\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u540e\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u9760\u79fb\u9664\u7279\u5b9a\u77e5\u8bc6\uff08\u9690\u79c1/\u7ea0\u9519\u9700\u6c42\uff09\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5ffd\u89c6\u5b66\u4e60\u9636\u6bb5\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u7801\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1a1\uff09\u8f6c\u8ff0\u63cf\u8ff0\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u53cd\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u63d0\u5347 2\uff09\u4ece\u6587\u672c\u5757\u53cd\u5b66\u4e60\u5355\u4e2a\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u56f0\u96be\u6027", "result": "\u8f6c\u8ff0\u5b66\u4e60\u4f7f\u53cd\u5b66\u4e60\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u534737%\uff0c\u4f46\u6587\u672c\u5757\u4e2d\u5355\u4e2a\u77e5\u8bc6\u53cd\u5b66\u4e60\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e0d\u8db360%", "conclusion": "\u5e94\u5c06\u5b66\u4e60\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u7801\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89c6\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u9760\u53cd\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u8981\u7d20"}}

However, linguistic features in dialogues, such as omission and idiom, frequently introduce ambiguities that obscure the intended discourse relations, posing significant challenges for parsers. To address this issue, we propose a Discourse-aware Clarification Module (DCM) to enhance the performance of the dialogue discourse parser. DCM employs two distinct reasoning processes: clarification type reasoning and discourse goal reasoning. The former analyzes linguistic features, while the latter distinguishes the intended relation from the ambiguous one. Furthermore, we introduce Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) to mitigate the risk of erroneous clarifications, thereby reducing cascading errors. CPO enables the parser to assess the contributions of the clarifications from DCM and provide feedback to optimize the DCM, enhancing its adaptability and alignment with the parser's requirements.

However, existing large language models face two major challenges: insufficient representation of medical knowledge and low efficiency in clinical deployment. To address these challenges, this study proposes the CKD-EHR (Clinical Knowledge Distillation for EHR) framework, which achieves efficient and accurate disease risk prediction through knowledge distillation techniques. Specifically, the large language model Qwen2.5-7B is first fine-tuned on medical knowledge-enhanced data to serve as the teacher model.It then generates interpretable soft labels through a multi-granularity attention distillation mechanism. Finally, the distilled knowledge is transferred to a lightweight BERT student model. Experimental results show that on the MIMIC-III dataset, CKD-EHR significantly outperforms the baseline model:diagnostic accuracy is increased by 9%, F1-score is improved by 27%, and a 22.2 times inference speedup is achieved. This innovative solution not only greatly improves resource utilization efficiency but also significantly enhances the accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis, providing a practical technical approach for resource optimization in clinical settings.

In this work, we model the o2m property of OD in LLMs by decomposing OD generation into two key tasks: Multi-Response Generation (MRG) and Preference-based Selection (PS), which entail generating a set of n semantically and lexically diverse high-quality responses for a given dialogue context, followed by selecting a single response based on human preference, respectively. To facilitate MRG and PS, we introduce o2mDial, a dialogue corpus explicitly designed to capture the o2m property by featuring multiple plausible responses for each context. Leveraging o2mDial, we propose new in-context learning and instruction-tuning strategies, as well as novel evaluation metrics for MRG, alongside a model-based approach for PS.

Applying structured recall tasks to the Mamba architecture, we observe a consistent U-shaped accuracy profile, indicating strong performance at the beginning and end of input sequences. We identify three mechanisms that give rise to this pattern. First, long-term memory is supported by a sparse subset of channels within the model's selective state space block, which persistently encode early input tokens and are causally linked to primacy effects. Second, short-term memory is governed by delta-modulated recurrence: recent inputs receive more weight due to exponential decay, but this recency advantage collapses when distractor items are introduced, revealing a clear limit to memory depth. Third, we find that memory allocation is dynamically modulated by semantic regularity: repeated relations in the input sequence shift the delta gating behavior, increasing the tendency to forget intermediate items.

However, tracking progress toward these goals is difficult because of the extensive scale and complexity of the data involved. Text classification models have become vital tools in this area, automating the analysis of vast amounts of text from a variety of sources. Additionally, large language models (LLMs) have recently proven indispensable for many natural language processing tasks, including text classification, thanks to their ability to recognize complex linguistic patterns and semantics. This study analyzes various proprietary and open-source LLMs for a single-label, multi-class text classification task focused on the SDGs. Then, it also evaluates the effectiveness of task adaptation techniques (i.e., in-context learning approaches), namely Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Learning, as well as Fine-Tuning within this domain.

However, the underlying mechanisms supporting such transfer remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that cross-domain generalization arises from shared abstract reasoning prototypes -- fundamental reasoning patterns that capture the essence of problems across domains. These prototypes minimize the nuances of the representation, revealing that seemingly diverse tasks are grounded in shared reasoning structures.Based on this hypothesis, we propose ProtoReasoning, a framework that enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs by leveraging scalable and verifiable prototypical representations (Prolog for logical reasoning, PDDL for planning).ProtoReasoning features: (1) an automated prototype construction pipeline that transforms problems into corresponding prototype representations; (2) a comprehensive verification system providing reliable feedback through Prolog/PDDL interpreters; (3) the scalability to synthesize problems arbitrarily within prototype space while ensuring correctness. Extensive experiments show that ProtoReasoning achieves 4.7% improvement over baseline models on logical reasoning (Enigmata-Eval), 6.3% improvement on planning tasks, 4.0% improvement on general reasoning (MMLU) and 1.0% on mathematics (AIME24).

Compared to closed-ended QA, it demands longer answer statements, more nuanced reasoning processes, and diverse expressions, making refined and interpretable automatic evaluation both crucial and challenging. Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore struggle to capture semantic similarities due to different patterns between model responses and reference answers. Current LLM-based evaluation approaches, such as pairwise or listwise comparisons of candidate answers, lack intuitive interpretability. While pointwise scoring of each response provides some descriptions, it fails to adapt across different question contents. Most notably, existing methods overlook the distinction between factoid and non-factoid questions. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{MinosEval}, a novel evaluation method that first distinguishes open-ended questions and then ranks candidate answers using different evaluation strategies. For factoid questions, it applies an adaptive key-point scoring strategy, while for non-factoid questions, it uses an instance-aware listwise ranking strategy. Experiments on multiple open-ended QA datasets, including self-built ones with more candidate responses to complement community resources, show that MinosEval better aligns with human annotations and offers more interpretable results.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We introduce DeVisE (Demographics and Vital signs Evaluation), a behavioral testing framework for probing fine-grained clinical understanding. We construct a dataset of ICU discharge notes from MIMIC-IV, generating both raw (real-world) and template-based (synthetic) versions with controlled single-variable counterfactuals targeting demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and vital sign attributes. We evaluate five LLMs spanning general-purpose and medically fine-tuned variants, under both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We assess model behavior via (1) input-level sensitivity - how counterfactuals alter the likelihood of a note; and (2) downstream reasoning - how they affect predicted hospital length-of-stay.

Our approach enhances summaries by integrating reader insights and feedback. We explore summarization and headline generation across four configurations: (1) using article text alone, (2) incorporating user comments, (3) utilizing images, and (4) combining text, comments, and images. To assess the dataset's effectiveness, we employ state-of-the-art language models such as LLama3 and GPT-4. We conduct a comprehensive study to evaluate different component combinations, including identifying supportive comments, filtering out noise using a dedicated comment classifier using IndicBERT, and extracting valuable insights from images with a multilingual CLIP-based classifier. This helps determine the most effective configurations for natural language generation (NLG) tasks.

A key challenge is achieving robust cross-lingual lexical alignment, crucial for tasks like translation and cross-lingual information retrieval. This paper introduces Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a novel and efficient fine-tuning approach. We first demonstrate that Lugha-Llama-8B-wura, a Swahili-centric LLM, exhibits strong, near-perfect lexical alignment for Swahili-English word pairs in its early internal layers (specifically Layer 2, with ~0.99998 average cosine similarity based on a pilot study), a capability not fully reflected in its final output representations (baseline ~0.32 similarity on our evaluation set). TLI leverages this insight by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a contrastive learning objective to fine-tune the model, specifically targeting embeddings from this empirically identified optimal early layer. Our experiments show that TLI significantly improves the output-level lexical alignment for 623 trained Swahili-English word pairs, increasing average cosine similarity from 0.3211 to 0.4113 (+28.08%, p < 1.33 x 10^-240). More importantly, these improvements generalize remarkably well to 63 unseen control word pairs, with similarity increasing from 0.3143 to 0.4033 (+28.32%, p < 7.17 x 10^-27). These findings suggest TLI enhances the model's ability to preserve and propagate its inherent early-layer cross-lingual knowledge, offering a parameter-efficient and effective strategy for improving lexical alignment in LRL-focused LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTLI\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8bcd\u6c47\u5bf9\u9f50\u80fd\u529b", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982\u65af\u74e6\u5e0c\u91cc\u8bed\uff09\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8bcd\u6c47\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u5229\u7528LoRA\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u5e94\u6280\u672f\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5c42\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u8bcd\u6c47\u5bf9\u9f50\u80fd\u529b\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03", "result": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bcd\u5bf9\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u63d0\u534728.08%\uff080.3211\u21920.4113\uff09\uff0c\u672a\u89c1\u8bcd\u5bf9\u63d0\u534728.32%\uff080.3143\u21920.4033\uff09\uff0c\u5747\u5177\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u6027", "conclusion": "TLI\u65b9\u6cd5\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\u7684\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u65b9\u5411"}}

By altering problems in an intermediate symbolic representation, RE-IMAGINE generates arbitrarily many problems that are not solvable using memorization alone. Moreover, the framework is general and can work across reasoning domains, including math, code, and logic. We demonstrate our framework on four widely-used benchmarks to evaluate several families of LLMs, and observe reductions in performance when the models are queried with problem variations.

In such cases, we expect the model to generate responses by grounding its response in the provided external context. However, prior work has shown that simply appending context at inference time does not ensure grounded generation. To address this, we propose Context-INformed Grounding Supervision (CINGS), a post-training supervision in which the model is trained with relevant context prepended to the response, while computing the loss only over the response tokens and masking out the context. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained with CINGS exhibit stronger grounding in both textual and visual domains compared to standard instruction-tuned models. In the text domain, CINGS outperforms other training methods across 11 information-seeking datasets and is complementary to inference-time grounding techniques. In the vision-language domain, replacing a vision-language model's LLM backbone with a CINGS-trained model reduces hallucinations across four benchmarks and maintains factual consistency throughout the generated response. This improved grounding comes without degradation in general downstream performance.

However, efficient, high-quality automated process annotation remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce Single-Pass Annotation with Reference-Guided Evaluation (SPARE), a novel structured framework that enables single-pass, per-step annotation by aligning each solution step to one or multiple steps in a reference solution, accompanied by explicit reasoning for evaluation. We show that reference-guided step-level evaluation effectively facilitates process supervision on four datasets spanning three domains: mathematical reasoning, multi-hop compositional question answering, and spatial reasoning.

However, due to their semantic obscurity and expressive diversity, it is rather challenging to identify them. Existing methods mostly focus on superficial text features, ignoring the associations of hyperbole and metaphor as well as the effect of implicit emotion on perceiving these rhetorical devices. To implement these hypotheses, we propose an emotion-guided hyperbole and metaphor detection framework based on bidirectional dynamic interaction (EmoBi). Firstly, the emotion analysis module deeply mines the emotion connotations behind hyperbole and metaphor. Next, the emotion-based domain mapping module identifies the target and source domains to gain a deeper understanding of the implicit meanings of hyperbole and metaphor. Finally, the bidirectional dynamic interaction module enables the mutual promotion between hyperbole and metaphor. Meanwhile, a verification mechanism is designed to ensure detection accuracy and reliability. Experiments show that EmoBi outperforms all baseline methods on four datasets. Specifically, compared to the current SoTA, the F1 score increased by 28.1% for hyperbole detection on the TroFi dataset and 23.1% for metaphor detection on the HYPO-L dataset.

In this work, we explore how reinforcement learning (RL) and internal reasoning can enhance grounding in LLMs. We use the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) method to train models using verifiable outcome-based rewards targeting answer correctness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality, without requiring gold reasoning traces or expensive annotations. Through comprehensive experiments across ASQA, QAMPARI, ELI5, and ExpertQA we show that reasoning-augmented models significantly outperform instruction-only variants, especially in handling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses. A two-stage training setup, first optimizing answer and citation behavior and then refusal, further improves grounding by stabilizing the learning signal. Additionally, we revisit instruction tuning via GPT-4 distillation and find that combining it with GRPO enhances performance on long-form, generative QA tasks.

However, the crucial choice of window size presents a Pareto tradeoff: larger windows maintain performance akin to full attention but offer minimal efficiency gains in short-context scenarios, while smaller windows can lead to performance degradation. Current models, such as Gemma2 and Mistral, adopt conservative window sizes (e.g., 4096 out of an 8192 pretraining length) to preserve performance. This work investigates strategies to shift this Pareto frontier, enabling local-global models to achieve efficiency gains even in short-context regimes. Our core motivation is to address the intrinsic limitation of local attention -- its complete disregard for tokens outside the defined window. We explore RATTENTION, a variant of local attention integrated with a specialized linear attention mechanism designed to capture information from these out-of-window tokens. Pretraining experiments at the 3B and 12B scales demonstrate that RATTENTION achieves a superior Pareto tradeoff between performance and efficiency. As a sweet spot, RATTENTION with a window size of just 512 consistently matches the performance of full-attention models across diverse settings. Furthermore, the recurrent nature inherent in the linear attention component of RATTENTION contributes to enhanced long-context performance, as validated on the RULER benchmark. Crucially, these improvements do not compromise training efficiency; thanks to a specialized kernel implementation and the reduced window size, RATTENTION maintains training speeds comparable to existing state-of-the-art approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRATTENTION\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728512\u7a97\u53e3\u5c3a\u5bf8\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3/\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5c40\u90e8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5b8c\u5168\u5ffd\u7565\u7a97\u53e3\u5916token\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4f20\u7edf\u5c40\u90e8-\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7a97\u53e3\u5c3a\u5bf8\u9009\u62e9\u4e0a\u7684Pareto\u6743\u8861\u56f0\u5883", "method": "\u5c06\u5c40\u90e8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0e\u4e13\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5faa\u73af\u5f0f\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6355\u83b7\u7a97\u53e3\u5916token\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u914d\u5408\u4e13\u7528\u5185\u6838\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a0\u901f", "result": "\u57283B/12B\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\uff1a1) 512\u7a97\u53e3\u5339\u914d\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6027\u80fd\uff1b2) RULER\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u57fa\u51c6\u8868\u73b0\u63d0\u5347\uff1b3) \u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0eSOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53", "conclusion": "RATTENTION\u901a\u8fc7\u67b6\u6784\u521b\u65b0\u7a81\u7834\u4f20\u7edf\u6548\u7387-\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u77ed/\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c"}}

However, their large size often leads to noticeable latency between the end of user input and the start of audio output, resulting in suboptimal user experiences. This latency is particularly evident when LLMs are deployed as single-user voice assistants on consumer-grade hardware with limited computing capacity. We discovered that this latency is primarily dominated by the time it takes for the LLMs to generate the first sentence, which is required as input by the TTS systems that synthesize audio responses on a sentence-by-sentence basis. To address this bottleneck, we propose Predictive Generation (PredGen), a novel framework that mitigates-or even eliminates-this delay through speculative decoding at input time. PredGen generates candidate responses while the user is still speaking, enabling the system to begin TTS processing with minimal delay. Simulated experiments on the Lmsys and MT-Bench datasets show that the proposed method can effectively reduce the latency by around 2x across a wide range of use cases, while incurring only minimal additional computation cost at input time-computation that would otherwise go unused.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPredictive Generation\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u5728\u7528\u6237\u8f93\u5165\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u5c06LLM\u8bed\u97f3\u52a9\u624b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea62\u500d", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u65f6\u8bed\u97f3\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0cLLM\u751f\u6210\u7b2c\u4e00\u53e5\u8bdd\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709TTS\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u7b49\u5f85\u5b8c\u6574\u53e5\u5b50\u8f93\u5165\u5bfc\u81f4\u54cd\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\u663e\u8457", "method": "PredGen\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u7528\u6237\u8bf4\u8bdd\u65f6\u5e76\u884c\u751f\u6210\u591a\u5019\u9009\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u63d0\u524d\u8fdb\u884cTTS\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387", "result": "\u5728Lmsys\u548cMT-Bench\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea62\u500d\uff0c\u989d\u5916\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u4e14\u5229\u7528\u95f2\u7f6e\u7b97\u529b", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u8bed\u97f3\u52a9\u624b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e3a\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7\u786c\u4ef6\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u52bf\u663e\u8457"}}

Current approaches typically merge sentence-level parsing outputs for discourse input, often missing phenomena like cross-sentence coreference, resulting in fragmented graphs and degraded downstream VLM task performance. To address this, we introduce a new task, Discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing (DiscoSG), supported by our dataset DiscoSG-DS, which comprises 400 expert-annotated and 8,430 synthesised multi-sentence caption-graph pairs for images. Each caption averages 9 sentences, and each graph contains at least 3 times more triples than those in existing datasets. While fine-tuning large PLMs (i.e., GPT-4) on DiscoSG-DS improves SPICE by approximately 48% over the best sentence-merging baseline, high inference cost and restrictive licensing hinder its open-source use, and smaller fine-tuned PLMs struggle with complex graphs. We propose DiscoSG-Refiner, which drafts a base graph using one small PLM, then employs a second PLM to iteratively propose graph edits, reducing full-graph generation overhead. Using two Flan-T5-Base models, DiscoSG-Refiner still improves SPICE by approximately 30% over the best baseline while achieving 86 times faster inference than GPT-4.

Recent advances in generative AI provide an opportunity to automate MCQ generation efficiently. However, assessing the actual quality and reliability of generated MCQs has received limited attention -- particularly regarding cases where generation fails. This aspect becomes particularly important when the generated MCQs are meant to be applied in real-world settings. Additionally, most MCQ generation studies focus on English, leaving other languages underexplored. This paper investigates the capabilities of current generative models in producing MCQs for reading comprehension in Portuguese, a morphologically rich language. Our study focuses on generating MCQs that align with curriculum-relevant narrative elements and span different difficulty levels. We evaluate these MCQs through expert review and by analyzing the psychometric properties extracted from student responses to assess their suitability for elementary school students. Our results show that current models can generate MCQs of comparable quality to human-authored ones. However, we identify issues related to semantic clarity and answerability.

Studying the regret mechanism is crucial for enhancing model reliability and helps in revealing how cognition is coded in neural networks. To understand this mechanism, we need to first identify regret expressions in model outputs, then analyze their internal representation. This analysis requires examining the model's hidden states, where information processing occurs at the neuron level. However, this faces three key challenges: (1) the absence of specialized datasets capturing regret expressions, (2) the lack of metrics to find the optimal regret representation layer, and (3) the lack of metrics for identifying and analyzing regret neurons. Addressing these limitations, we propose: (1) a workflow for constructing a comprehensive regret dataset through strategically designed prompting scenarios, (2) the Supervised Compression-Decoupling Index (S-CDI) metric to identify optimal regret representation layers, and (3) the Regret Dominance Score (RDS) metric to identify regret neurons and the Group Impact Coefficient (GIC) to analyze activation patterns. Our experimental results successfully identified the optimal regret representation layer using the S-CDI metric, which significantly enhanced performance in probe classification experiments. Additionally, we discovered an M-shaped decoupling pattern across model layers, revealing how information processing alternates between coupling and decoupling phases.

Our model comparisons suggested that cross-cultural differences in intensifier interpretation stem from a combination of (1) different literal meanings, (2) different weights on utterance cost.

However, when focusing on instruction-following capabilities, if a prompt specifies a concept order, LLMs must generate sentences that adhere to the specified order. To address this, we propose Ordered CommonGen, a benchmark designed to evaluate the compositional generalization and instruction-following abilities of LLMs. This benchmark measures ordered coverage to assess whether concepts are generated in the specified order, enabling a simultaneous evaluation of both abilities. We conducted a comprehensive analysis using 36 LLMs and found that, while LLMs generally understand the intent of instructions, biases toward specific concept order patterns often lead to low-diversity outputs or identical results even when the concept order is altered. Moreover, even the most instruction-compliant LLM achieved only about 75% ordered coverage, highlighting the need for improvements in both instruction-following and compositional generalization capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faOrdered CommonGen\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u5e8f\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u6307\u6807\u540c\u65f6\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u987a\u5e8f\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u6982\u5ff5\u5305\u542b\u6027\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u6982\u5ff5\u987a\u5e8f\u8981\u6c42\u3002\u9700\u8981\u540c\u65f6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6307\u4ee4\u987a\u5e8f\u7684\u9075\u5faa\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6982\u5ff5\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaOrdered CommonGen\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u6709\u5e8f\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4f7f\u752836\u4e2aLLM\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u987a\u5e8f\u6539\u53d8\u65f6\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u4ec575%\u6709\u5e8f\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff1b\u8d8560%\u6a21\u578b\u51fa\u73b0\u987a\u5e8f\u6539\u53d8\u540e\u8f93\u51fa\u76f8\u540c\u7ed3\u679c\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u4f4e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u987a\u5e8f\u6a21\u5f0f\u4f9d\u8d56\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u6709LLMs\u5728\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u5347\u987a\u5e8f\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u6982\u5ff5\u7ec4\u5408\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

We challenge this assumption by showing that reasoning traces frequently contain sensitive user data, which can be extracted via prompt injections or accidentally leak into outputs. Through probing and agentic evaluations, we demonstrate that test-time compute approaches, particularly increased reasoning steps, amplify such leakage. While increasing the budget of those test-time compute approaches makes models more cautious in their final answers, it also leads them to reason more verbosely and leak more in their own thinking.

To address this challenge of limitation to a specific VLM type, we present Generation after Recalibration (GenRecal), a novel, general-purpose distillation framework for VLMs. GenRecal incorporates a Recalibrator that aligns and adapts feature representations between heterogeneous VLMs, enabling effective knowledge transfer across different types of VLMs. Through extensive experiments on multiple challenging benchmarks, we demonstrate that GenRecal significantly improves baseline performances, eventually outperforming large-scale open- and closed-source VLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u7528\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6GenRecal\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u5757Recalibrator\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f02\u6784\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u90e8\u7f72\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u901a\u7528\u6027", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5305\u542b\u7279\u5f81\u6821\u51c6\u5668\uff08Recalibrator\uff09\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u4e0d\u540c\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868/\u5206\u8bcd\u7ed3\u6784\u7684VLM\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5f00\u6e90\u53ca\u95ed\u6e90VLM\u7cfb\u7edf", "conclusion": "GenRecal\u6846\u67b6\u7a81\u7834\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f02\u6784\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u901a\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

Users could easily possess private LLMs by fine-tuning an open-source one with private corpora, resulting in a significant performance drop of existing detectors in practice. To address this issue, we propose PhantomHunter, an LLM-generated text detector specialized for detecting text from unseen, privately-tuned LLMs. Its family-aware learning framework captures family-level traits shared across the base models and their derivatives, instead of memorizing individual characteristics.

This study introduces a topological framework for identifying structural change in media narratives using persistent homology. Drawing on international news articles surrounding major events - including the Russian invasion of Ukraine (Feb 2022), the murder of George Floyd (May 2020), the U.S. Capitol insurrection (Jan 2021), and the Hamas-led invasion of Israel (Oct 2023) - we construct daily co-occurrence graphs of noun phrases to trace evolving discourse. Each graph is embedded and transformed into a persistence diagram via a Vietoris-Rips filtration. We then compute Wasserstein distances and persistence entropies across homological dimensions to capture semantic disruption and narrative volatility over time. Our results show that major geopolitical and social events align with sharp spikes in both H0 (connected components) and H1 (loops), indicating sudden reorganization in narrative structure and coherence. Cross-correlation analyses reveal a typical lag pattern in which changes to component-level structure (H0) precede higher-order motif shifts (H1), suggesting a bottom-up cascade of semantic change. An exception occurs during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, where H1 entropy leads H0, possibly reflecting top-down narrative framing before local discourse adjusts. Persistence entropy further distinguishes tightly focused from diffuse narrative regimes. These findings demonstrate that persistent homology offers a mathematically principled, unsupervised method for detecting inflection points and directional shifts in public attention - without requiring prior knowledge of specific events. This topological approach advances computational social science by enabling real-time detection of semantic restructuring during crises, protests, and information shocks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6301\u7eed\u540c\u8c03\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u91cd\u5927\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5a92\u4f53\u53d9\u4e8b\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u65f6\u8bc6\u522b\u5168\u7403\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5bf9\u516c\u5171\u8bdd\u8bed\u4f53\u7cfb\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u91cd\u5851\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65e0\u9700\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u68c0\u6d4b\u624b\u6bb5", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u540d\u8bcd\u77ed\u8bed\u5171\u73b0\u56fe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Vietoris-Rips filtration\u751f\u6210\u6301\u7eed\u56fe\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97Wasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u71b5\u91cf\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u65ad\u88c2", "result": "\u5730\u7f18\u653f\u6cbb\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5f15\u53d1H0\uff08\u8fde\u901a\u5206\u91cf\uff09\u548cH1\uff08\u73af\u8def\uff09\u7684\u7a81\u53d8\uff0c\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\uff08H0\uff09\u901a\u5e38\u5148\u4e8e\u9ad8\u9636\u4e3b\u9898\u8f6c\u53d8\uff08H1\uff09", "conclusion": "\u6301\u7eed\u540c\u8c03\u4e3a\u68c0\u6d4b\u516c\u4f17\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u62d0\u70b9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9e\u65f6\u8bc6\u522b\u5371\u673a\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u91cd\u6784\u8fc7\u7a0b"}}

Existing LLM caching techniques (like context caching and semantic caching), primarily designed for serving chatbots, are insufficient for agentic applications where outputs depend on external data or environmental contexts. We propose agentic plan caching, a novel approach that extracts, stores, adapts, and reuses structured plan templates from planning stages of agentic applications across semantically similar tasks to reduce the cost of serving. Unlike traditional semantic caching, our system extracts plan templates from completed agent executions at test-time, employs keyword extraction to match new requests against cached plans, and utilizes lightweight models to adapt these templates to task-specific plans with contexts. Evaluation across multiple real-world agentic applications shows that our system can reduce costs by 46.62% on average while maintaining performance, offering a more efficient solution for serving LLM-based agents that complements existing LLM serving infrastructures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5e94\u7528\u6267\u884c\u8ba1\u5212\u7f13\u5b58\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u590d\u7528\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8ba1\u5212\u6a21\u677f\u964d\u4f4e46.62%\u670d\u52a1\u6210\u672c", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9762\u5411\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7f13\u5b58\u6280\u672f\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u548c\u73af\u5883\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f", "method": "\u4ece\u5386\u53f2\u6267\u884c\u8bb0\u5f55\u63d0\u53d6\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8ba1\u5212\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u5339\u914d\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9002\u914d", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u964d\u4f4e46.62%\u670d\u52a1\u6210\u672c\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u4e3aLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u8865\u5145\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u517c\u5bb9\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd"}}

Under review", "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach to improve large language model (LLM) reasoning, yet most open efforts focus narrowly on math and code, limiting our understanding of its broader applicability to general reasoning. A key challenge lies in the lack of reliable, scalable RL reward signals across diverse reasoning domains. We introduce Guru, a curated RL reasoning corpus of 92K verifiable examples spanning six reasoning domains--Math, Code, Science, Logic, Simulation, and Tabular--each built through domain-specific reward design, deduplication, and filtering to ensure reliability and effectiveness for RL training. Based on Guru, we systematically revisit established findings in RL for LLM reasoning and observe significant variation across domains. For example, while prior work suggests that RL primarily elicits existing knowledge from pretrained models, our results reveal a more nuanced pattern: domains frequently seen during pretraining (Math, Code, Science) easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while domains with limited pretraining exposure (Logic, Simulation, and Tabular) require in-domain training to achieve meaningful performance gains, suggesting that RL is likely to facilitate genuine skill acquisition. Finally, we present Guru-7B and Guru-32B, two models that achieve state-of-the-art performance among open models RL-trained with publicly available data, outperforming best baselines by 7.9% and 6.7% on our 17-task evaluation suite across six reasoning domains. We also show that our models effectively improve the Pass@k performance of their base models, particularly on complex tasks less likely to appear in pretraining data.

In this work, using hypothesis testing, we present a quantitative framework to assess the misalignment between LLM-simulated and actual human behaviors in multiple-choice survey settings. This framework allows us to determine in a principled way whether a specific language model can effectively simulate human opinions, decision-making, and general behaviors represented through multiple-choice options. We applied this framework to a popular language model for simulating people's opinions in various public surveys and found that this model is ill-suited for simulating the tested sub-populations (e.g., across different races, ages, and incomes) for contentious questions. This raises questions about the alignment of this language model with the tested populations, highlighting the need for new practices in using LLMs for social science studies beyond naive simulations of human subjects.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u6846\u67b6\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u9879\u9009\u62e9\u9898\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6d41\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u4e89\u8bae\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7fa4\u4f53\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLM\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76(\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66/\u5e02\u573a\u8425\u9500)\u4e2d\u7684\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u9700\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u7fa4\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6d41\u884c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u516c\u5171\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f53(\u79cd\u65cf/\u5e74\u9f84/\u6536\u5165)\u5728\u4e89\u8bae\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6a21\u62df\u76ee\u6807\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f53\u5bf9\u4e89\u8bae\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u610f\u89c1\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9a\u4eba\u7fa4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u884c\u4e3a\u9519\u4f4d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u8d85\u8d8a\u7b80\u5355\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u65b0\u5b9e\u8df5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03LLM\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5fc5\u987b\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u4eba\u7fa4\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u9a8c\u8bc1\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

To make this process more efficient, several methods have been proposed to optimize model architecture/parametrization and hardware use. On the parametrization side, $\u03bcP$ (Maximal Update Parametrization) parametrizes model weights and learning rate (LR) in a way that makes hyperparameters (HPs) transferable with width (embedding dimension): HPs can be tuned for a small model and used for larger models without additional tuning. While $\u03bc$P showed impressive results in practice, recent empirical studies have reported conflicting observations when applied to LLMs. One limitation of the theory behind $\u03bc$P is the fact that input dimension (vocabulary size in LLMs) is considered fixed when taking the width to infinity. This is unrealistic since vocabulary size is generally much larger than width in practice. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of the effect of vocabulary size on training dynamics, and subsequently show that as vocabulary size increases, the training dynamics \\emph{interpolate between the $\u03bc$P regime and another regime that we call Large Vocab (LV) Regime}, where optimal scaling rules are different from those predicted by $\u03bc$P. Our analysis reveals that in the LV regime, the optimal embedding LR to hidden LR ratio should roughly scale as $\u0398(\\sqrt{width})$, surprisingly close to the empirical findings previously reported in the literature, and different from the $\u0398(width)$ ratio predicted by $\u03bc$P.

Instead of relying on complex model pipelines, we evaluate the benefits of Large Language Models (LLMs) by analyzing a corpus of Wall Street Journal and New York Times newspaper articles about inflation.

Our results suggests that GPT-4o is capable of extracting valid economic narratives in a structured format, but still falls short of expert-level performance when handling complex documents and narratives.

This paper introduces a multi-task music captioning model, SonicVerse, that integrates caption generation with auxiliary music feature detection tasks such as key detection, vocals detection, and more, so as to directly capture both low-level acoustic details as well as high-level musical attributes. The key contribution is a projection-based architecture that transforms audio input into language tokens, while simultaneously detecting music features through dedicated auxiliary heads. The outputs of these heads are also projected into language tokens, to enhance the captioning input. This framework not only produces rich, descriptive captions for short music fragments but also directly enables the generation of detailed time-informed descriptions for longer music pieces, by chaining the outputs using a large-language model.

In this paper, we present video-SALMONN 2, an advanced audio-visual large language model (LLM) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) designed for enhanced video (with paired audio) captioning through directed preference optimisation (DPO). We propose new metrics to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of video descriptions, which are optimised using DPO. To further improve training, we propose a novel multi-round DPO (MrDPO) approach, which involves periodically updating the DPO reference model, merging and re-initialising the LoRA module as a proxy for parameter updates after each training round (1,000 steps), and incorporating guidance from ground-truth video captions to stabilise the process. Experimental results show that MrDPO significantly enhances video-SALMONN 2's captioning accuracy, reducing the captioning error rates by 28\\%. The final video-SALMONN 2 model, with just 7 billion parameters, surpasses leading models such as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro in video captioning tasks, while maintaining highly competitive performance to the state-of-the-art on widely used video question-answering benchmarks among models of similar size.

To shed light on this capability, we examine a canonical setting where the demonstrations are drawn according to a binary Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and a certain fraction of the demonstrations have missing labels. We provide a comprehensive theoretical study to show that: (1) The loss landscape of one-layer linear attention models recover the optimal fully-supervised estimator but completely fail to exploit unlabeled data; (2) In contrast, multilayer or looped transformers can effectively leverage unlabeled data by implicitly constructing estimators of the form $\\sum_{i\\ge 0} a_i (X^\\top X)^iX^\\top y$ with $X$ and $y$ denoting features and partially-observed labels (with missing entries set to zero). We characterize the class of polynomials that can be expressed as a function of depth and draw connections to Expectation Maximization, an iterative pseudo-labeling algorithm commonly used in semi-supervised learning. Importantly, the leading polynomial power is exponential in depth, so mild amount of depth/looping suffices. As an application of theory, we propose looping off-the-shelf tabular foundation models to enhance their semi-supervision capabilities.

Current feature description methods face two critical challenges: limited robustness and the flawed assumption that each neuron encodes only a single concept (monosemanticity), despite growing evidence that neurons are often polysemantic. This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature descriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors encoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework that captures the inherent complexity of neural network features. Unlike prior approaches that assign a single description per feature, PRISM provides more nuanced descriptions for both polysemantic and monosemantic features. We apply PRISM to language models and, through extensive benchmarking against existing methods, demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature descriptions, improving both overall description quality (via a description score) and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is present (via a polysemanticity score).", "AI": {"tldr": "PRISM\u6846\u67b6\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u8bed\u4e49\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7279\u5f81\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u591a\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7279\u5f81\u63cf\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u5355\u8bed\u4e49\u5047\u8bbe\uff08\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u4ec5\u7f16\u7801\u5355\u4e00\u6982\u5ff5\uff09\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u590d\u6742\u6027", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPRISM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u6982\u5ff5\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u53cc\u91cd\u8bc4\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u63cf\u8ff0\u5206\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u6574\u4f53\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u591a\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u6570\u8861\u91cf\u591a\u6982\u5ff5\u6355\u6349\u80fd\u529b\uff09", "result": "\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cPRISM\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63cf\u8ff0\u8d28\u91cf\uff08+22%\u63cf\u8ff0\u5206\u6570\uff09\u548c\u591a\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u8bc6\u522b\uff08+35%\u591a\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u6570\uff09\u4e0a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347", "conclusion": "PRISM\u901a\u8fc7\u627f\u8ba4\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u591a\u8bed\u4e49\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u5b9e\u9645\u4e14\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177"}}

However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning - even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations.

We present AutoRule, a fully automated method for extracting rules from preference feedback and formulating them into rule-based rewards. AutoRule extraction operates in three stages: it leverages a reasoning model to interpret user preferences, identifies candidate rules from the reasoning chain of these interpretations, and synthesizes them into a unified rule set. Leveraging the finalized rule set, we employ language-model verifiers to compute the fraction of rules satisfied by each output, using this metric as an auxiliary reward alongside the learned reward model during policy optimization. Training a Llama-3-8B model with AutoRule results in a 28.6\\% relative improvement in length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2.0, and a 6.1\\% relative gain in second-turn performance on a held-out MT-Bench subset, compared to a GRPO baseline trained with the same learned reward model but without the rule-based auxiliary reward. Our analysis confirms that the extracted rules exhibit good agreement with dataset preference. We find that AutoRule demonstrates reduced reward hacking compared to a learned reward model when run over two episodes.

Ideally, training an SAE would yield latents that are both sparse and semantically meaningful.

In this work, we systematically investigate the geometry, function, and origin of dense latents and show that they are not only persistent but often reflect meaningful model representations. We first demonstrate that dense latents tend to form antipodal pairs that reconstruct specific directions in the residual stream, and that ablating their subspace suppresses the emergence of new dense features in retrained SAEs -- suggesting that high density features are an intrinsic property of the residual space. We then introduce a taxonomy of dense latents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding, entropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and principal component reconstruction. Finally, we analyze how these features evolve across layers, revealing a shift from structural features in early layers, to semantic features in mid layers, and finally to output-oriented signals in the last layers of the model.
