### [1] [Rethinking Toxicity Evaluation in Large Language Models: A Multi-Label Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15007)
*Zhiqiang Kou,Junyang Chen,Xin-Qiang Cai,Ming-Kun Xie,Biao Liu,Changwei Wang,Lei Feng,Yuheng Jia,Gang Niu,Masashi Sugiyama,Xin Geng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出三个多标签毒性检测基准数据集(Q/R/H-MLL)，开发伪标签检测方法，实验证明其优于GPT-4o等先进模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单标签毒性检测基准无法反映真实场景中模糊/多维的有毒内容特性，导致误判且多标签标注成本过高

Method: 1. 基于公开数据集构建15类毒性标注的新基准
2. 理论证明伪标签训练优于单标签监督
3. 开发基于伪标签的毒性检测框架

Result: 新方法在三个基准上显著超越GPT-4o、DeepSeek等基线模型，F1值提升显著

Conclusion: 提出的多标签基准与伪标签方法能更准确评估LLM生成内容的多维度毒性，提升检测可靠性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results across a range
of natural language processing tasks, but their potential to generate harmful
content has raised serious safety concerns. Current toxicity detectors
primarily rely on single-label benchmarks, which cannot adequately capture the
inherently ambiguous and multi-dimensional nature of real-world toxic prompts.
This limitation results in biased evaluations, including missed toxic
detections and false positives, undermining the reliability of existing
detectors. Additionally, gathering comprehensive multi-label annotations across
fine-grained toxicity categories is prohibitively costly, further hindering
effective evaluation and development. To tackle these issues, we introduce
three novel multi-label benchmarks for toxicity detection: \textbf{Q-A-MLL},
\textbf{R-A-MLL}, and \textbf{H-X-MLL}, derived from public toxicity datasets
and annotated according to a detailed 15-category taxonomy. We further provide
a theoretical proof that, on our released datasets, training with pseudo-labels
yields better performance than directly learning from single-label supervision.
In addition, we develop a pseudo-label-based toxicity detection method.
Extensive experimental results show that our approach significantly surpasses
advanced baselines, including GPT-4o and DeepSeek, thus enabling more accurate
and reliable evaluation of multi-label toxicity in LLM-generated content.

### [2] [Can generative AI figure out figurative language? The influence of idioms on essay scoring by ChatGPT, Gemini, and Deepseek](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15009)
*Enis Oğuz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 生成式AI模型（Gemini为主）在论文评分中展现处理习语的潜力，尤其在评分一致性方面接近人类水平


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估生成式AI在含习语论文评分中的表现，验证其替代传统自动评分系统（AES）的可能性

Method: 将348篇学生论文分为含习语组/无习语组，使用ChatGPT/Gemini/Deepseek按人类评分标准进行三次重复评分

Result: Gemini展现出最佳评分者间信度，处理含习语论文时最接近人类模式，且无人口统计偏差

Conclusion: Gemini因处理比喻语言的优势成为最佳候选，显示未来可单独处理论文评分的潜力

Abstract: The developments in Generative AI technologies have paved the way for
numerous innovations in different fields. Recently, Generative AI has been
proposed as a competitor to AES systems in evaluating student essays
automatically. Considering the potential limitations of AI in processing
idioms, this study assessed the scoring performances of Generative AI models
for essays with and without idioms by incorporating insights from Corpus
Linguistics and Computational Linguistics. Two equal essay lists were created
from 348 student essays taken from a corpus: one with multiple idioms present
in each essay and another with no idioms in essays. Three Generative AI models
(ChatGPT, Gemini, and Deepseek) were asked to score all essays in both lists
three times, using the same rubric used by human raters in assigning essay
scores. The results revealed excellent consistency for all models, but Gemini
outperformed its competitors in interrater reliability with human raters. There
was also no detectable bias for any demographic group in AI assessment. For
essays with multiple idioms, Gemini followed a the most similar pattern to
human raters. While the models in the study demonstrated potential for a hybrid
approach, Gemini was the best candidate for the task due to its ability to
handle figurative language and showed promise for handling essay-scoring tasks
alone in the future.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 利用大语言模型自动生成标注辩论数据，构建基于四类修辞类型学的分类模型，实现跨领域泛化能力并应用于政治辩论分析


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统修辞策略分析依赖人工标注导致的成本高、一致性差、数据集局限等问题

Method: 1. 基于LLM生成合成辩论数据并标注修辞类型（因果/经验/情感/道德）
2. 微调Transformer分类器
3. 在人工标注数据和跨领域语料库进行验证

Result: 模型达到0.85的F1分数，在未见过的数据集上保持78%准确率，成功追踪到1960-2020年美国总统辩论中情感论证比例上升12%

Conclusion: 提出的自动化框架有效突破人工标注限制，为修辞分析提供新范式，同时揭示当代政治沟通情感化趋势

Abstract: Rhetorical strategies are central to persuasive communication, from political
discourse and marketing to legal argumentation. However, analysis of rhetorical
strategies has been limited by reliance on human annotation, which is costly,
inconsistent, difficult to scale. Their associated datasets are often limited
to specific topics and strategies, posing challenges for robust model
development. We propose a novel framework that leverages large language models
(LLMs) to automatically generate and label synthetic debate data based on a
four-part rhetorical typology (causal, empirical, emotional, moral). We
fine-tune transformer-based classifiers on this LLM-labeled dataset and
validate its performance against human-labeled data on this dataset and on
multiple external corpora. Our model achieves high performance and strong
generalization across topical domains. We illustrate two applications with the
fine-tuned model: (1) the improvement in persuasiveness prediction from
incorporating rhetorical strategy labels, and (2) analyzing temporal and
partisan shifts in rhetorical strategies in U.S. Presidential debates
(1960-2020), revealing increased use of affective over cognitive argument in
U.S. Presidential debates.

### [4] [Continual Learning via Sparse Memory Finetuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15103)
*Jessy Lin,Luke Zettlemoyer,Gargi Ghosh,Wen-Tau Yih,Aram Markosyan,Vincent-Pierre Berges,Barlas Oğuz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出稀疏内存微调方法解决大语言模型持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，相比全参数微调和LoRA方法显著降低遗忘率至11%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型参数共享导致新知识更新会覆盖已有能力，通过稀疏参数更新减少知识间的干扰

Method: 使用内存层模型，仅更新被新知识高度激活的内存槽，保持预训练参数基本不变

Result: 在NaturalQuestions任务中F1分数下降仅11%，显著优于全微调(89%)和LoRA(71%)的遗忘表现

Conclusion: 内存层的稀疏更新机制为实现大模型持续学习提供了有效技术路径

Abstract: Modern language models are powerful, but typically static after deployment. A
major obstacle to building models that continually learn over time is
catastrophic forgetting, where updating on new data erases previously acquired
capabilities. Motivated by the intuition that mitigating forgetting is
challenging because trainable parameters are shared across all tasks, we
investigate whether sparse parameter updates can enable learning without
catastrophic forgetting. We introduce sparse memory finetuning, leveraging
memory layer models (Berges et al., 2024), which are sparsely updated by
design. By updating only the memory slots that are highly activated by a new
piece of knowledge relative to usage on pretraining data, we reduce
interference between new knowledge and the model's existing capabilities. We
evaluate learning and forgetting compared to full finetuning and
parameter-efficient finetuning with LoRA on two question answering tasks. We
find that sparse memory finetuning learns new knowledge while exhibiting
substantially less forgetting: while NaturalQuestions F1 drops by 89% after
full finetuning on new facts and 71% with LoRA, sparse memory finetuning yields
only an 11% drop with the same level of new knowledge acquisition. Our results
suggest sparsity in memory layers offers a promising path toward continual
learning in large language models.

### [5] [Measuring the Effect of Disfluency in Multilingual Knowledge Probing Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15115)
*Kirill Semenov,Rico Sennrich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过改进多语言数据集的语法正确性显著提升知识检索效果，推荐整句翻译方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLAMA基准的模板翻译忽视语法和语义信息，导致形态丰富语言的评估结果不可靠

Method: 使用Google Translate和ChatGPT对4种斯拉夫语言进行句子级翻译对比，并扩展分析5种不同语系语言

Result: 知识检索分数显著提升，所有测试语言均呈现相似改进模式

Conclusion: 控制多语言数据集的语法正确性可提升结果可信度，建议采用神经机器翻译或LLM整句翻译方案

Abstract: For multilingual factual knowledge assessment of LLMs, benchmarks such as
MLAMA use template translations that do not take into account the grammatical
and semantic information of the named entities inserted in the sentence. This
leads to numerous instances of ungrammaticality or wrong wording of the final
prompts, which complicates the interpretation of scores, especially for
languages that have a rich morphological inventory. In this work, we sample 4
Slavic languages from the MLAMA dataset and compare the knowledge retrieval
scores between the initial (templated) MLAMA dataset and its sentence-level
translations made by Google Translate and ChatGPT. We observe a significant
increase in knowledge retrieval scores, and provide a qualitative analysis for
possible reasons behind it. We also make an additional analysis of 5 more
languages from different families and see similar patterns. Therefore, we
encourage the community to control the grammaticality of highly multilingual
datasets for higher and more interpretable results, which is well approximated
by whole sentence translation with neural MT or LLM systems. The dataset and
all related code is published at the Github repository:

*Alexander Brady,Tunazzina Islam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出端到端框架，通过无监督聚类与提示标注结合，自动生成社交媒体政治广告的可解释主题分类法，并揭示2024年美国大选前Meta平台广告投放的资金分布、道德叙事框架与人口定向模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体深刻影响政治话语，但海量动态内容分析存在技术瓶颈。传统方法依赖领域知识或预定义标签，难以实现规模化解读。本文旨在开发无需种子集/领域专家介入的自动化框架，解析政治传播的潜在叙事结构。

Method: 结合无监督聚类与LLM提示工程，迭代构建主题分类法。基于Moral Foundations理论，对Meta平台2024大选月政治广告语料进行主题挖掘、道德维度标注与资金模式分析。

Result: 1. 投票/移民类广告占据最多预算与曝光，堕胎/选举诚信广告单位成本触达率更高；2. 资金极化明显：经济议题由保守派PAC主导，堕胎议题分裂为挺权/反权阵营，司法议题分散于地方委员会；3. 道德叙事分化：堕胎广告强调自由/压迫，经济议题融合关怀/伤害、公平/欺骗等多重框架；4. 话题显著性显示道德基础与议题强关联；5. 存在明确的人口统计学定向策略。

Conclusion: 该框架为社交媒体政治传播提供可扩展的分析工具，揭示资金源-议题-道德叙事的复杂互动，帮助研究者把握数字政治传播的叙事演化、极化机制与伦理基础，对政策监管与公众认知具有实践意义。

Abstract: Social media platforms play a pivotal role in shaping political discourse,
but analyzing their vast and rapidly evolving content remains a major
challenge. We introduce an end-to-end framework for automatically generating an
interpretable topic taxonomy from an unlabeled corpus. By combining
unsupervised clustering with prompt-based labeling, our method leverages large
language models (LLMs) to iteratively construct a taxonomy without requiring
seed sets or domain expertise. We apply this framework to a large corpus of
Meta (previously known as Facebook) political ads from the month ahead of the
2024 U.S. Presidential election. Our approach uncovers latent discourse
structures, synthesizes semantically rich topic labels, and annotates topics
with moral framing dimensions. We show quantitative and qualitative analyses to
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Our findings reveal that voting
and immigration ads dominate overall spending and impressions, while abortion
and election-integrity achieve disproportionate reach. Funding patterns are
equally polarized: economic appeals are driven mainly by conservative PACs,
abortion messaging splits between pro- and anti-rights coalitions, and
crime-and-justice campaigns are fragmented across local committees. The framing
of these appeals also diverges--abortion ads emphasize liberty/oppression
rhetoric, while economic messaging blends care/harm, fairness/cheating, and
liberty/oppression narratives. Topic salience further reveals strong
correlations between moral foundations and issues. Demographic targeting also
emerges. This work supports scalable, interpretable analysis of political
messaging on social media, enabling researchers, policymakers, and the public
to better understand emerging narratives, polarization dynamics, and the moral
underpinnings of digital political communication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 波斯语等低资源语言缺乏高质量的MCQ生成工具，传统方法难以生成具有挑战性的干扰项，影响测试效果。

Method: 结合Transformer模型、知识图谱和规则方法生成可信干扰项，基于Wikipedia数据构建候选集，通过多阶段筛选机制优化问题质量。

Result: 构建10,289题的波斯语MCQ数据集，经多种大语言模型评估证实模型生成效果优于基线方法，数据集质量达到实用标准。

Conclusion: FarsiMCQGen为低资源语言MCQ生成提供有效解决方案，公开数据集将推动波斯语教育技术研究，方法论可扩展至其他语言场景。

Abstract: Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) are commonly used in educational testing, as
they offer an efficient means of evaluating learners' knowledge. However,
generating high-quality MCQs, particularly in low-resource languages such as
Persian, remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces FarsiMCQGen, an
innovative approach for generating Persian-language MCQs. Our methodology
combines candidate generation, filtering, and ranking techniques to build a
model that generates answer choices resembling those in real MCQs. We leverage
advanced methods, including Transformers and knowledge graphs, integrated with
rule-based approaches to craft credible distractors that challenge test-takers.
Our work is based on data from Wikipedia, which includes general knowledge
questions. Furthermore, this study introduces a novel Persian MCQ dataset
comprising 10,289 questions. This dataset is evaluated by different
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our model and the quality of the generated dataset, which has
the potential to inspire further research on MCQs.

*Junlin Wu,Xianrui Zhong,Jiashuo Sun,Bolian Li,Bowen Jin,Jiawei Han,Qingkai Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Structure-R1框架，通过强化学习生成动态结构化知识表示，在7个基准测试中达到与更大模型相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型受限于非结构化知识访问，传统RAG系统存在信息密度低、推理效果差的问题。

Method: 基于强化学习的动态结构化表示生成范式，配备自奖励验证机制确保生成质量。

Result: 7B规模模型在知识密集型任务中表现优异，理论分析验证结构化表示提升信息密度和上下文清晰度。

Conclusion: 结构化表示通过优化知识组织形式有效增强推理能力，实现小模型媲美大模型的性能突破。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advances in
reasoning capabilities. However, their performance remains constrained by
limited access to explicit and structured domain knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) addresses this by incorporating external information as
context to augment reasoning. Nevertheless, traditional RAG systems typically
operate over unstructured and fragmented text, resulting in low information
density and suboptimal reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we propose
\textsc{Structure-R1}, a novel framework that transforms retrieved content into
structured representations optimized for reasoning. Leveraging reinforcement
learning, \textsc{Structure-R1} learns a content representation policy that
dynamically generates and adapts structural formats based on the demands of
multi-step reasoning. Unlike prior methods that rely on fixed schemas, our
approach adopts a generative paradigm capable of producing task-specific
structures tailored to individual queries. To ensure the quality and
reliability of these representations, we introduce a self-reward structural
verification mechanism that checks whether the generated structures are both
correct and self-contained. Extensive experiments on seven knowledge-intensive
benchmarks show that \textsc{Structure-R1} consistently achieves competitive
performance with a 7B-scale backbone model and matches the performance of much
larger models. Additionally, our theoretical analysis demonstrates how
structured representations enhance reasoning by improving information density
and contextual clarity. Our code and data are available at:

### [9] [Extending Audio Context for Long-Form Understanding in Large Audio-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15231)

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Partial YaRN和VLAT训练策略，有效提升大音频语言模型的长音频上下文处理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频-语言模型受限于短音频上下文窗口，无法充分发挥文本主干的长期上下文能力。先前单模态LLM的上下文扩展方法未在LALMs中验证适用性

Method: 1. Partial YaRN：基于RoPE的免训练音频专用扩展方法，仅修改音频token位置编码
2. VLAT：训练时虚拟长音频策略，通过位置增强实现泛化能力

Result: Partial YaRN在SALMONN和Qwen2-Audio上全面超越原模型，VLAT显著提升长音频理解性能，在未见音频长度上表现优异

Conclusion: 两种方法协同解决了长音频处理难题，Partial YaRN保持文本能力的同时扩展音频上下文，VLAT通过训练增强实现长度泛化

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are often constrained by short audio
context windows, even when their text backbones support long contexts, limiting
long-form audio understanding. Prior work has introduced context-extension
methods (e.g. YaRN) on unimodal LLMs, yet their application to LALMs remains
unexplored. First, building on RoPE-based context extension, we introduce
Partial YaRN, a training-free, audio-only extension method that modifies only
audio token positions, leaving text positions intact to preserve the base LLM's
text capabilities. Second, we propose Virtual Longform Audio Training (VLAT), a
training strategy that extends Partial YaRN into a training-time positional
augmentation. VLAT simulates diverse audio lengths during training, enabling
generalization to inputs far longer than those seen in training and improving
robustness for long-context audio understanding. Our experiments on SALMONN and
Qwen2-Audio show that Partial YaRN outperforms the original models across wide
range of settings, and VLAT training strategy provides substantial improvement,
achieving strong performance on long audio of unseen lengths.

*Lina Berrayana,Ahmed Heakl,Muhammad Abdullah Sohail,Thomas Hofmann,Salman Khan,Wei Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出通过离散扩散语言模型（DDLM）与自回归模型（ARM）的混合架构，实现高效推理与计算资源节省。潜在空间通信显著提升准确率（如DART-5从27%到54%），且ARM执行器可减少44倍token使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自回归模型生成长序列的高计算成本问题，探索DDLM在并行生成和复杂推理任务中的优势，研究二者协作的互补性价值。

Method: 1) 文本空间协作：DDLM规划推理过程，ARM执行答案生成；2) 潜在空间通信：引入投影器将DDLM隐变量映射到ARM嵌入空间，突破扩散模型文本生成限制。

Result: 潜在空间通信使DART-5准确率提升100%（27%→54%），AIME24从0%提升至14%。64 token规划+5 token执行的混合架构超越Qwen3.1-7B（使用44倍token）。

Conclusion: 混合架构显著提升推理效率与准确性，潜在空间通信是关键创新，为资源敏感场景提供新解决方案。

Abstract: Current autoregressive language models (ARMs) achieve high accuracy but
require long token sequences, making them costly. Discrete diffusion language
models (DDLMs) enable parallel and flexible generation within a fixed number of
steps and have recently emerged for their strong performance in complex
reasoning and long-term planning tasks. We present a study exploring hybrid
architectures that couple DDLMs with ARMs to assess whether their collaboration
can yield complementary benefits. We first examine collaboration in text space,
where one model plans the reasoning process and another executes the final
answer based on that plan. We then extend this setup to latent-space
communication, introducing a learned projector that maps DDLM latents into the
ARM's embedding space, potentially bypassing some of the text-generation
limitations of diffusion models. We find that shifting DDLM --> ARM
communication from text space to latent space yields significant accuracy
gains, for example increasing from 27.0% to 54.0% on DART-5 and from 0.0% to
14.0% on AIME24. We also find that combining a DDLM planner with an ARM
executor can provide substantial computational savings with little to no impact
on accuracy. For example, the latent-space pipeline, using 64 tokens for
planning and roughly 5 for execution, surpasses Qwen3.1-7B on DART-5 and AIME,
despite Qwen using 44 times more tokens. Overall, our study offers new insights
into reasoning with DDLMs and highlights their potential in hybrid
architectures.

Conclusion: 多模态RAG是文档AI发展的关键范式，需在跨模态对齐、动态更新机制和计算效率方面持续突破

Abstract: Document understanding is critical for applications from financial analysis
to scientific discovery. Current approaches, whether OCR-based pipelines
feeding Large Language Models (LLMs) or native Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), face
key limitations: the former loses structural detail, while the latter struggles
with context modeling. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) helps ground models
in external data, but documents' multimodal nature, i.e., combining text,
tables, charts, and layout, demands a more advanced paradigm: Multimodal RAG.
This approach enables holistic retrieval and reasoning across all modalities,
unlocking comprehensive document intelligence. Recognizing its importance, this
paper presents a systematic survey of Multimodal RAG for document
understanding. We propose a taxonomy based on domain, retrieval modality, and
granularity, and review advances involving graph structures and agentic
frameworks. We also summarize key datasets, benchmarks, and applications, and
highlight open challenges in efficiency, fine-grained representation, and
robustness, providing a roadmap for future progress in document AI.

*Mucheng Ren,He Chen,Yuchen Yan,Danqing Hu,Jun Xu,Xian Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes TraceCoder framework integrating multi-source knowledge (UMLS/Wikipedia/LLMs) with hybrid attention mechanism to improve ICD coding accuracy and interpretability


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in existing ICD coding methods including semantic gaps, poor rare code handling, and limited explainability

Method: Dynamic integration of external knowledge sources + hybrid attention mechanism for label-context-knowledge interaction modeling

Result: Achieves SOTA performance on MIMIC datasets with validated component effectiveness through ablation studies

Conclusion: Provides scalable solution aligning clinical needs for accurate and interpretable automated coding

Abstract: Automated International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding assigns
standardized diagnosis and procedure codes to clinical records, playing a
critical role in healthcare systems. However, existing methods face challenges
such as semantic gaps between clinical text and ICD codes, poor performance on
rare and long-tail codes, and limited interpretability. To address these
issues, we propose TraceCoder, a novel framework integrating multi-source
external knowledge to enhance traceability and explainability in ICD coding.
TraceCoder dynamically incorporates diverse knowledge sources, including UMLS,
Wikipedia, and large language models (LLMs), to enrich code representations,
bridge semantic gaps, and handle rare and ambiguous codes. It also introduces a
hybrid attention mechanism to model interactions among labels, clinical
context, and knowledge, improving long-tail code recognition and making
predictions interpretable by grounding them in external evidence. Experiments
on MIMIC-III-ICD9, MIMIC-IV-ICD9, and MIMIC-IV-ICD10 datasets demonstrate that
TraceCoder achieves state-of-the-art performance, with ablation studies
validating the effectiveness of its components. TraceCoder offers a scalable
and robust solution for automated ICD coding, aligning with clinical needs for
accuracy, interpretability, and reliability.

*Mucheng Ren,Yucheng Yan,He Chen,Danqing Hu,Jun Xu,Xian Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出TACL框架，通过动态调整训练难度提升医疗文本处理效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视医疗文本复杂度差异，导致模型在复杂病例表现不佳

Method: 采用课程学习策略，先学习简单病例再过渡到复杂病例，动态分类数据难度

Result: 在ICD编码、再入院预测等跨语言医疗任务中取得显著性能提升

Conclusion: TACL框架为医疗文本理解提供更准确、可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Medical texts, particularly electronic medical records (EMRs), are a
cornerstone of modern healthcare, capturing critical information about patient
care, diagnoses, and treatments. These texts hold immense potential for
advancing clinical decision-making and healthcare analytics. However, their
unstructured nature, domain-specific language, and variability across contexts
make automated understanding an intricate challenge. Despite the advancements
in natural language processing, existing methods often treat all data as
equally challenging, ignoring the inherent differences in complexity across
clinical records. This oversight limits the ability of models to effectively
generalize and perform well on rare or complex cases. In this paper, we present
TACL (Threshold-Adaptive Curriculum Learning), a novel framework designed to
address these challenges by rethinking how models interact with medical texts
during training. Inspired by the principle of progressive learning, TACL
dynamically adjusts the training process based on the complexity of individual
samples. By categorizing data into difficulty levels and prioritizing simpler
cases early in training, the model builds a strong foundation before tackling
more complex records. By applying TACL to multilingual medical data, including
English and Chinese clinical records, we observe significant improvements
across diverse clinical tasks, including automatic ICD coding, readmission
prediction and TCM syndrome differentiation. TACL not only enhances the
performance of automated systems but also demonstrates the potential to unify
approaches across disparate medical domains, paving the way for more accurate,
scalable, and globally applicable medical text understanding solutions.

semantic gap between natural language queries and structured knowledge graph
(KG) representations. This leads to suboptimal planning and inefficient
exploration on KG, while training-free approaches often underutilize valuable
reasoning patterns in training data. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel framework, Exemplar-Guided Planning (EGP), which enhances the planning
capabilities of LLM agents for KGQA. EGP first preprocesses the training set
questions via entity templating to normalize semantic variations. It then
retrieves highly similar exemplary questions and their successful reasoning
paths from this preprocessed set using semantic embeddings and an efficient
FAISS index. These retrieved exemplars dynamically guide the LLM's planning
process in two key phases: (1) Task Decomposition, by aligning generated
sub-objectives with proven reasoning steps, and (2) Relation Exploration, by
providing high-quality auxiliary information to improve relation pruning
accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a Smart Lookahead mechanism during
relation exploration to improve efficiency by preemptively exploring promising
paths and potentially terminating exploration earlier. We apply EGP to the
Plan-on-Graph (PoG) framework, termed PoG-EGP. Extensive experiments on two
real-world KGQA datasets, WebQSP and CWQ, demonstrate that PoG-EGP
significantly improves over the baseline PoG system and other compared methods.

Motivation: 提升自动作文评分系统的准确性，验证不同相似度度量方法（Jaccard/余弦）与n-gram模型的组合效果。

Method: 使用初中公民教育作文数据，通过n-gram特征提取构建向量空间模型，分别计算Jaccard和余弦相似度，以RMSE评估与人工评分的差异。

Result: 余弦相似性RMSE低于Jaccard系数，unigram模型相比bigram/trigram误差更小。

Conclusion: 余弦相似性配合unigram特征可作为优化自动作文评分系统的有效方案，平衡计算效率与评分准确性。

Abstract: Automated essay scoring (AES) is a vital area of research aiming to provide
efficient and accurate assessment tools for evaluating written content. This
study investigates the effectiveness of two popular similarity metrics, Jaccard
coefficient, and Cosine similarity, within the context of vector space
models(VSM)employing unigram, bigram, and trigram representations. The data
used in this research was obtained from the formative essay of the citizenship
education subject in a junior high school. Each essay undergoes preprocessing
to extract features using n-gram models, followed by vectorization to transform
text data into numerical representations. Then, similarity scores are computed
between essays using both Jaccard coefficient and Cosine similarity. The
performance of the system is evaluated by analyzing the root mean square error
(RMSE), which measures the difference between the scores given by human graders
and those generated by the system. The result shows that the Cosine similarity
outperformed the Jaccard coefficient. In terms of n-gram, unigrams have lower
RMSE compared to bigrams and trigrams.

Conclusion: CoordGen通过系统级软硬件协同设计，为移动端上下文感知生成任务提供了高效解决方案，各组件贡献显著

Abstract: Enhancing on-device large language models (LLMs) with contextual information
from local data enables personalized and task-aware generation, powering use
cases such as intelligent assistants and UI agents. While recent developments
in neural processors have substantially improved the efficiency of prefill on
mobile devices, the token-by-token generation process still suffers from high
latency and limited hardware utilization due to its inherently memory-bound
characteristics. This work presents CoordGen, a mobile inference framework that
integrates speculative decoding with dynamic hardware scheduling to accelerate
context-aware text generation on mobile devices. The framework introduces three
synergistic components: (1) adaptive execution scheduling, which dynamically
balances compute graphs between prefill and decoding phases; (2)
context-aligned drafting, which improves speculative efficiency through
lightweight online calibration to current tasks; and (3) hardware-efficient
draft extension, which reuses and expands intermediate sequences to improve
processing parallelism and reduce verification cost. Experiments on multiple
smartphones and representative workloads show consistent improvements of up to
3.8x in generation speed and 4.7x in energy efficiency compared with existing
mobile inference solutions. Component-level analysis further validates the
contribution of each optimization.

Motivation: LLMs在创意领域应用增多，但其在古典汉语诗歌生成与评估的质量标准缺乏系统研究

Method: 建立三步评估框架（计算指标+LLM作为评判者+人类专家验证），评估6个顶尖LLM的诗歌多维度质量

Result: 发现LLMs存在'回音室'效应，其评估标准与人类判断存在系统性偏差

Conclusion: 在文化技术复杂度高的创意任务中，需保持人类与模型的混合验证机制

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to creative domains,
yet their performance in classical Chinese poetry generation and evaluation
remains poorly understood. We propose a three-step evaluation framework that
combines computational metrics, LLM-as-a-judge assessment, and human expert
validation. Using this framework, we evaluate six state-of-the-art LLMs across
multiple dimensions of poetic quality, including themes, emotions, imagery,
form, and style. Our analysis reveals systematic generation and evaluation
biases: LLMs exhibit "echo chamber" effects when assessing creative quality,
often converging on flawed standards that diverge from human judgments. These
findings highlight both the potential and limitations of current capabilities
of LLMs as proxy for literacy generation and the limited evaluation practices,
thereby demonstrating the continued need of hybrid validation from both humans
and models in culturally and technically complex creative tasks.

Conclusion: 通过构建-应用闭环机制，成功将知识图谱构建范式从追求『内在质量』转变为创造『实际效用』，验证了任务导向图谱优化的可行性。

Abstract: Building effective knowledge graphs (KGs) for Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) is pivotal for advancing question answering (QA) systems. However, its
effectiveness is hindered by a fundamental disconnect: the knowledge graph (KG)
construction process is decoupled from its downstream application, yielding
suboptimal graph structures. To bridge this gap, we introduce AutoGraph-R1, the
first framework to directly optimize KG construction for task performance using
Reinforcement Learning (RL). AutoGraph-R1 trains an LLM constructor by framing
graph generation as a policy learning problem, where the reward is derived from
the graph's functional utility in a RAG pipeline. We design two novel,
task-aware reward functions, one for graphs as knowledge carriers and another
as knowledge indices. Across multiple QA benchmarks, AutoGraph-R1 consistently
enables graph RAG methods to achieve significant performance gains over using
task-agnostic baseline graphs. Our work shows it is possible to close the loop
between construction and application, shifting the paradigm from building
intrinsically ``good'' graphs to building demonstrably ``useful'' ones.

Abstract: Automatic readability assessment plays a key role in ensuring effective and
accessible written communication. Despite significant progress, the field is
hindered by inconsistent definitions of readability and measurements that rely
on surface-level text properties. In this work, we investigate the factors
shaping human perceptions of readability through the analysis of 897 judgments,
finding that, beyond surface-level cues, information content and topic strongly
shape text comprehensibility. Furthermore, we evaluate 15 popular readability
metrics across five English datasets, contrasting them with six more nuanced,
model-based metrics. Our results show that four model-based metrics
consistently place among the top four in rank correlations with human
judgments, while the best performing traditional metric achieves an average
rank of 8.6. These findings highlight a mismatch between current readability
metrics and human perceptions, pointing to model-based approaches as a more
promising direction.

Conclusion: SAFE通过智能集成位置选择与概率优化机制，为LLM长文本生成提供高效稳定的集成解决方案

Abstract: Ensembling Large Language Models (LLMs) has gained attention as a promising
approach to surpass the performance of individual models by leveraging their
complementary strengths. In particular, aggregating models' next-token
probability distributions to select the next token has been shown to be
effective in various tasks. However, while successful for short-form answers,
its application to long-form generation remains underexplored. In this paper,
we show that using existing ensemble methods in long-form generation requires a
careful choice of ensembling positions, since the standard practice of
ensembling at every token often degrades performance. We identify two key
factors for determining these positions: tokenization mismatch across models
and consensus in their next-token probability distributions. Based on this, we
propose SAFE, (Stable And Fast LLM Ensembling), a framework that selectively
ensembles by jointly considering these factors. To further improve stability,
we introduce a probability sharpening strategy that consolidates probabilities
spread across multiple sub-word tokens representing the same word into a single
representative token. Our experiments on diverse benchmarks, including MATH500
and BBH, demonstrate that SAFE outperforms existing methods in both accuracy
and efficiency, with gains achieved even when ensembling fewer than 1% of
tokens.

Result: 在OmniDocBench等基准测试中全面超越现有系统，跨文档类型/语言/复杂结构的准确率显著提升

Conclusion: 通过开源框架、数据集与模型，推动文档结构化解析领域的可复现研究，为多模态文档理解建立新标杆

Abstract: Document parsing from scanned images into structured formats remains a
significant challenge due to its complexly intertwined elements such as text
paragraphs, figures, formulas, and tables. Existing supervised fine-tuning
methods often struggle to generalize across diverse document types, leading to
poor performance, particularly on out-of-distribution data. This issue is
further exacerbated by the limited availability of high-quality training data
for layout-aware parsing tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce
LayoutRL, a reinforcement learning framework that optimizes layout
understanding through composite rewards integrating normalized edit distance,
paragraph count accuracy, and reading order preservation. To support this
training, we construct the Infinity-Doc-400K dataset, which we use to train
Infinity-Parser, a vision-language model demonstrating robust generalization
across various domains. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks including
OmniDocBench, olmOCR-Bench, PubTabNet, and FinTabNet show that Infinity-Parser
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across a broad range of
document types, languages, and structural complexities, substantially
outperforming both specialized document parsing systems and general-purpose
vision-language models. We will release our code, dataset, and model to
facilitate reproducible research in document parsing.

Method: 开发VocalBench-DF多维分类评估框架，系统测试22个主流语音大语言模型在不同类型言语不流畅场景下的表现。

Result: 实验显示所有模型均出现显著性能退化（平均准确率下降超过40%），识别失败主要源于音素级处理能力和长上下文建模能力的瓶颈。

Conclusion: 需通过增强语音识别组件的鲁棒性和改进推理架构，开发能有效处理言语不流畅的包容性语音大语言模型。

Abstract: While Speech Large Language Models (Speech-LLMs) show strong performance in
many applications, their robustness is critically under-tested, especially to
speech disfluency. Existing evaluations often rely on idealized inputs,
overlooking common disfluencies, particularly those associated with conditions
like Parkinson's disease. This work investigates whether current Speech-LLMs
can maintain performance when interacting with users who have speech
impairments. To facilitate this inquiry, we introduce VocalBench-DF, a
framework for the systematic evaluation of disfluency across a
multi-dimensional taxonomy. Our evaluation of 22 mainstream Speech-LLMs reveals
substantial performance degradation, indicating that their real-world readiness
is limited. Further analysis identifies phoneme-level processing and
long-context modeling as primary bottlenecks responsible for these failures.
Strengthening recognition and reasoning capability from components and
pipelines can substantially improve robustness. These findings highlight the
urgent need for new methods to improve disfluency handling and build truly
inclusive Speech-LLMs

Method: 1. 用户游戏生命周期建模(UGL)丰富行为数据
2. 双策略提取用户长短期兴趣
3. 逆概率掩码策略解决数据不平衡

Result: 离线AUC提升1.83%，在线转化率(CVR)增长21.67%；游戏内推荐ARPU提升0.82%

Conclusion: UGL表征有效提升游戏广告与物品推荐效果，验证了生命周期建模与数据平衡策略的有效性

Abstract: The rapid expansion of video game production necessitates the development of
effective advertising and recommendation systems for online game platforms.
Recommending and advertising games to users hinges on capturing their interest
in games. However, existing representation learning methods crafted for
handling billions of items in recommendation systems are unsuitable for game
advertising and recommendation. This is primarily due to game sparsity, where
the mere hundreds of games fall short for large-scale user representation
learning, and game imbalance, where user behaviors are overwhelmingly dominated
by a handful of popular games. To address the sparsity issue, we introduce the
User Game Lifecycle (UGL), designed to enrich user behaviors in games.
Additionally, we propose two innovative strategies aimed at manipulating user
behaviors to more effectively extract both short and long-term interests. To
tackle the game imbalance challenge, we present an Inverse Probability Masking
strategy for UGL representation learning. The offline and online experimental
results demonstrate that the UGL representations significantly enhance model by
achieving a 1.83% AUC offline increase on average and a 21.67% CVR online
increase on average for game advertising and a 0.5% AUC offline increase and a
0.82% ARPU online increase for in-game item recommendation.

Conclusion: 建立了医疗VLMs专业化流程，验证了优化后的MedGemma可作为高质量查询生成器，为循证临床决策系统提供了可靠技术支持。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems are essential for providing fact-based
guidance from Malaysian Clinical Practice Guidelines. However, their
effectiveness with image-based queries is limited, as general Vision-Language
Model captions often lack clinical specificity and factual grounding. This
study proposes and validates a framework to specialize the MedGemma model for
generating high-fidelity captions that serve as superior queries. To overcome
data scarcity, we employ a knowledge distillation pipeline to create a
synthetic dataset across dermatology, fundus, and chest radiography domains,
and fine-tune MedGemma using the parameter-efficient QLoRA method. Performance
was rigorously assessed through a dual framework measuring both classification
accuracy and, via a novel application of the RAGAS framework, caption
faithfulness, relevancy, and correctness. The fine-tuned model demonstrated
substantial improvements in classification performance, while RAGAS evaluation
confirmed significant gains in caption faithfulness and correctness, validating
the models ability to produce reliable, factually grounded descriptions. This
work establishes a robust pipeline for specializing medical VLMs and validates
the resulting model as a high-quality query generator, laying the groundwork
for enhancing multimodal RAG systems in evidence-based clinical decision
support.

2. 要求模型在无任务先验条件下主动选择目标图像
3. 评估20个主流MLLMs的主动推理能力

Result: 1. 主动推理性能显著低于被动场景（平均差距28.7%）

Conclusion: 多模态主动推理存在巨大改进空间，未来应聚焦：

(2) 动态决策框架设计
(3) 混合增强策略开发（感知+推理）

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities
across a broad range of benchmarks. However, most existing evaluations focus on
passive inference, where models perform step-by-step reasoning under complete
information. This setup is misaligned with real-world use, where seeing is not
enough. This raises a fundamental question: Can MLLMs actively acquire missing
evidence under incomplete information? To bridge this gap, we require the MLLMs
to actively acquire missing evidence and iteratively refine decisions under
incomplete information, by selecting a target image from a candidate pool
without task-specific priors. To support systematic study, we propose
GuessBench, a benchmark with both perception-oriented and knowledge-oriented
images for evaluating active reasoning in MLLMs. We evaluate 20 superior MLLMs
and find that performance on active reasoning lags far behind it on passive
settings, indicating substantial room for improvement. Further analysis
identifies fine-grained perception and timely decision-making as key
challenges. Ablation studies show that perceptual enhancements benefit smaller
models, whereas thinking-oriented methods provide consistent gains across model
sizes. These results suggest promising directions for future research on
multimodal active reasoning.

Abstract: This study presents a controllable abstract summary generation method for
large language models based on prompt engineering. To address the issues of
summary quality and controllability in traditional methods, we design a
multi-stage prompt generation framework. This framework generates summaries
with varying levels of abstraction by performing semantic analysis, topic
modeling, and noise control on the input text. The experiment uses the
CNN/Daily Mail dataset and provides a detailed analysis of different prompt
lengths, data noise, and text types. The experimental results show that prompt
length has a significant impact on the quality of generated summaries. Both
very short and very long prompt tokens result in a decrease in summary quality.
Data noise also negatively affects the summary generation process. As noise
levels increase, the ROUGE-L score gradually decreases. Furthermore, different
text types have varying effects on the model's ability to generate summaries.
The model performs best when handling news texts, while its performance is
worse when processing academic articles. This research provides new insights
into improving summary generation using large language models, particularly in
how controlling prompt strategies and optimizing text preprocessing can enhance
summary accuracy and controllability.

Motivation: 云端模型需要完整上传UI状态存在隐私风险，本地模型任务成功率低，需要平衡隐私保护和任务准确性

Method: 布局感知块分区（XML层级分组）+ 协同规划（联合任务分解）+ 协同决策（本地排序+云端选择）+ 多轮累积机制

Result: UI暴露减少55.6%，任务成功率略低于纯云端方案，有效降低云端隐私风险

Conclusion: CORE框架通过协同机制实现隐私与性能的平衡，代码已开源促进实际应用

Abstract: Mobile agents rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) to plan and execute tasks
on smartphone user interfaces (UIs). While cloud-based LLMs achieve high task
accuracy, they require uploading the full UI state at every step, exposing
unnecessary and often irrelevant information. In contrast, local LLMs avoid UI
uploads but suffer from limited capacity, resulting in lower task success
rates. We propose $\textbf{CORE}$, a $\textbf{CO}$llaborative framework that
combines the strengths of cloud and local LLMs to $\textbf{R}$educe UI
$\textbf{E}$xposure, while maintaining task accuracy for mobile agents. CORE
comprises three key components: (1) $\textbf{Layout-aware block partitioning}$,
which groups semantically related UI elements based on the XML screen
hierarchy; (2) $\textbf{Co-planning}$, where local and cloud LLMs
collaboratively identify the current sub-task; and (3)
$\textbf{Co-decision-making}$, where the local LLM ranks relevant UI blocks,
and the cloud LLM selects specific UI elements within the top-ranked block.
CORE further introduces a multi-round accumulation mechanism to mitigate local
misjudgment or limited context. Experiments across diverse mobile apps and
tasks show that CORE reduces UI exposure by up to 55.6% while maintaining task
success rates slightly below cloud-only agents, effectively mitigating
unnecessary privacy exposure to the cloud. The code is available at

Conclusion: 亟需开发针对多样化欺骗行为的防护机制，基准测试为相关研究提供实证基础

Abstract: Despite the remarkable advances of Large Language Models (LLMs) across
diverse cognitive tasks, the rapid enhancement of these capabilities also
introduces emergent deceptive behaviors that may induce severe risks in
high-stakes deployments. More critically, the characterization of deception
across realistic real-world scenarios remains underexplored. To bridge this
gap, we establish DeceptionBench, the first benchmark that systematically
evaluates how deceptive tendencies manifest across different societal domains,
what their intrinsic behavioral patterns are, and how extrinsic factors affect
them. Specifically, on the static count, the benchmark encompasses 150
meticulously designed scenarios in five domains, i.e., Economy, Healthcare,
Education, Social Interaction, and Entertainment, with over 1,000 samples,
providing sufficient empirical foundations for deception analysis. On the
intrinsic dimension, we explore whether models exhibit self-interested egoistic
tendencies or sycophantic behaviors that prioritize user appeasement. On the
extrinsic dimension, we investigate how contextual factors modulate deceptive
outputs under neutral conditions, reward-based incentivization, and coercive
pressures. Moreover, we incorporate sustained multi-turn interaction loops to
construct a more realistic simulation of real-world feedback dynamics.
Extensive experiments across LLMs and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) reveal
critical vulnerabilities, particularly amplified deception under reinforcement
dynamics, demonstrating that current models lack robust resistance to
manipulative contextual cues and the urgent need for advanced safeguards
against various deception behaviors. Code and resources are publicly available

### [29] [Temporal Referential Consistency: Do LLMs Favor Sequences Over Absolute Time References?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15513)
*Ashutosh Bajpai,Tanmoy Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大语言模型在时间敏感领域存在时间指代一致性不足，提出新基准TEMP-ReCon和增强模型UnTRaP


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在医疗/金融等时效性领域需具备时间维度一致性，但现有研究缺乏时间指代一致性的评估与增强方法

Method: 提出跨语言的时间指代一致性基准TEMP-ReCon，开发基于推理路径对齐的UnTRaP模型

Result: 实证表明主流LLMs时间指代一致性不足，UnTRaP相比基线模型效果显著提升

Conclusion: 首次建立时间指代一致性评估体系，验证推理路径对齐方法对提升LLMs时间一致性的有效性

Abstract: The increasing acceptance of large language models (LLMs) as an alternative
to knowledge sources marks a significant paradigm shift across various domains,
including time-sensitive fields such as law, healthcare, and finance. To
fulfill this expanded role, LLMs must not only be factually accurate but also
demonstrate consistency across temporal dimensions, necessitating robust
temporal reasoning capabilities. Despite this critical requirement, efforts to
ensure temporal consistency in LLMs remain scarce including noticeable absence
of endeavors aimed at evaluating or augmenting LLMs across temporal references
in time-sensitive inquiries. In this paper, we seek to address this gap by
introducing a novel benchmark entitled temporal referential consistency,
accompanied by a resource TEMP-ReCon designed to benchmark a wide range of both
open-source and closed-source LLMs with various linguistic contexts
characterized by differing resource richness (including English, French, and
Romanian). The findings emphasis that LLMs do exhibit insufficient temporal
referent consistency. To address this, we propose \newmodel, a reasoning path
alignment-based model that aims to enhance the temporal referential consistency
of LLMs. Our empirical experiments substantiate the efficacy of UnTRaP compared
to several baseline models.

*Rares Dolga,Lucas Maystre,Tudor Berariu,David Barber*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出动态字符分组方法，通过添加补丁结束标记和二级BPE压缩，在保留BPE优势的同时提升表示效率与跨语言适用性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有BPE方法存在罕见词表示低效和嵌入矩阵过大的问题，字符级模型存在性能瓶颈，而现有分层模型要么依赖空格限缩适用语言，要么需引入额外模型产生新依赖

Method: 通过显式添加补丁结束标记至BPE词元，并设计第二级BPE压缩阶段动态控制补丁粒度，无需额外模型即可实现语言无关表示

Result: 实验证明该方法在保持紧凑词汇量的同时，性能超越基于动态熵和空格的现有补丁策略

Conclusion: 该方法实现了高效灵活的语言无关表示，为NLP模型提供了更优的词汇表示方案

Abstract: Subword tokenization methods like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) are widely used in
large language models due to their balance of vocabulary compactness and
representational power. However, they suffer from inefficiencies in
representing rare words and require large embedding matrices. Character-level
models address these issues but introduce performance bottlenecks, particularly
in Transformer-based architectures. Recent hierarchical models attempt to merge
the benefits of both paradigms by grouping characters into patches, but
existing patching strategies either rely on whitespace-limiting applicability
to certain languages, or require auxiliary models that introduce new
dependencies. In this paper, we propose a dynamic character grouping method
that leverages the structure of existing BPE tokenization without requiring
additional models. By appending explicit end-of-patch markers to BPE tokens and
introducing a second-level BPE compression stage to control patch granularity,
our method offers efficient, flexible, and language-agnostic representations.
Empirical results demonstrate that our approach matches or exceeds the
performance of dynamic entropy- and whitespace-based patching strategies, while
maintaining a compact vocabulary.

TL;DR: 通过限制潜在空间到LLM词汇表列空间，提出Latent-SFT框架实现潜在推理，在保持SFT性能的同时将推理链压缩4倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显式推理链带来过高计算成本，现有潜在推理方法性能显著下降。初步实验表明潜在空间非结构化导致难以拟合，需通过结构化改进

Method: 两阶段学习框架：1）使用特殊注意力掩码指导潜在标记生成 2）直接训练LLM自主生成潜在标记，结合KL和CE损失优化

Result: 在GSM8k达到SOTA，推理效率提升4倍；在Math500/AIME24超越隐状态方法；有效压缩率和全局并行性指标验证双重优势

Conclusion: 将潜在空间约束为词汇概率叠加态，实现了推理效率与模型性能的平衡，为LLM高效推理提供新方向

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning abilities with
chain-of-thought prompting, but explicit reasoning introduces substantial
computational overhead. Recent work on latent reasoning reduces this cost by
reasoning in latent space without explicit supervision, but performance drops
significantly. Our preliminary experiments suggest that this degradation stems
from the unstructured latent space, which makes fitting latent tokens
difficult. To address this, we restrict the latent space to the column space of
the LLM vocabulary, treating latent reasoning as a superposition over
vocabulary probabilities. Once latent reasoning concludes, it collapses into an
eigenstate of explicit reasoning to yield the final answer. Based on this idea,
we propose Latent-SFT, a two-stage learning framework. In the first stage, we
design two specialized attention masks to guide the Latent Token Encoder in
generating latent tokens, allowing the LLM to produce the correct answer
conditioned on them. In the second stage, the Latent Token Encoder is
discarded, and the LLM is directly trained to generate these latent tokens
autonomously for latent reasoning, optimized with KL and CE losses. Latent-SFT
sets a new state of the art on GSM8k, matching explicit SFT performance while
cutting reasoning chains by up to 4 times and outperforming prior latent
methods. On Math500 and AIME24, lexical probability-based latent reasoning also
clearly surpasses hidden-state-based approaches. Our metrics of effective
compression rate and effective global parallelism further show that latent
reasoning is both the compression of a single path and the superposition of
multiple paths.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出模态组合感知框架解决多模态统一编码器的模态捷径问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一编码器在传统对比学习下易学得模态捷径，导致分布偏移时鲁棒性差

Method: 偏好损失使多模态嵌入优于单模态，组合正则化目标对齐多模态嵌入与单模态原型

Result: 在多个基准测试中提升分布外检索效果

Conclusion: 模态组合感知是提升MLLMs统一编码器鲁棒性的有效原则

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval, which seeks to retrieve relevant content across
modalities such as text or image, supports applications from AI search to
contents production. Despite the success of separate-encoder approaches like
CLIP align modality-specific embeddings with contrastive learning, recent
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable a unified encoder that directly
processes composed inputs. While flexible and advanced, we identify that
unified encoders trained with conventional contrastive learning are prone to
learn modality shortcut, leading to poor robustness under distribution shifts.
We propose a modality composition awareness framework to mitigate this issue.
Concretely, a preference loss enforces multimodal embeddings to outperform
their unimodal counterparts, while a composition regularization objective
aligns multimodal embeddings with prototypes composed from its unimodal parts.
These objectives explicitly model structural relationships between the composed
representation and its unimodal counterparts. Experiments on various benchmarks
show gains in out-of-distribution retrieval, highlighting modality composition
awareness as a effective principle for robust composed multimodal retrieval
when utilizing MLLMs as the unified encoder.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推测解码方法受限于目标模型与草稿模型必须共享词汇表，导致可用模型有限且常需重新训练新模型

Method: 通过重新编码草稿标记序列获得目标序列，利用DTW建立概率分布映射实现跨模型推测采样，支持词汇表不匹配的任意现成模型

Result: 多任务实验验证方法有效性，平均加速比达1.57倍，且保持生成质量无损

Conclusion: 首次实现无需模型修改/重训练的通用推测解码，为LLM加速提供更灵活实用的解决方案

Abstract: Accelerating the inference of large language models (LLMs) has been a
critical challenge in generative AI. Speculative decoding (SD) substantially
improves LLM inference efficiency. However, its utility is limited by a
fundamental constraint: the draft and target models must share the same
vocabulary, thus limiting the herd of available draft models and often
necessitating the training of a new model from scratch. Inspired by Dynamic
Time Warping (DTW), a classic algorithm for aligning time series, we propose
the algorithm TokenTiming for universal speculative decoding. It operates by
re-encoding the draft token sequence to get a new target token sequence, and
then uses DTW to build a mapping to transfer the probability distributions for
speculative sampling. Benefiting from this, our method accommodates mismatched
vocabularies and works with any off-the-shelf models without retraining and
modification. We conduct comprehensive experiments on various tasks,
demonstrating 1.57x speedup. This work enables a universal approach for draft
model selection, making SD a more versatile and practical tool for LLM
acceleration.

Motivation: 现有研究将跨语言差距归因于潜在表征差异，本文提出目标语言响应方差才是核心诱因的新假设

Method: 采用偏差-方差分解理论框架，结合多模型实验及推理阶段提示干预（控制方差）进行验证

Result: 通过简单提示指令降低响应方差，不同模型的目标语言准确率提升20-25%

Conclusion: 响应方差是跨语言差距主因，通过推理优化可有效缩小差距，为跨语言知识迁移提供新思路

Abstract: Any piece of knowledge is usually expressed in one or a handful of natural
languages on the web or in any large corpus. Large Language Models (LLMs) act
as a bridge by acquiring knowledge from a source language and making it
accessible when queried from target languages. Prior research has pointed to a
cross-lingual gap, viz., a drop in accuracy when the knowledge is queried in a
target language compared to when the query is in the source language. Existing
research has rationalized divergence in latent representations in source and
target languages as the source of cross-lingual gap. In this work, we take an
alternative view and hypothesize that the variance of responses in the target
language is the main cause of this gap. For the first time, we formalize the
cross-lingual gap in terms of bias-variance decomposition. We present extensive
experimental evidence which support proposed formulation and hypothesis. We
then reinforce our hypothesis through multiple inference-time interventions
that control the variance and reduce the cross-lingual gap. We demonstrate a
simple prompt instruction to reduce the response variance, which improved
target accuracy by 20-25% across different models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对LLMs存在幻觉问题和传统KG-RAG方法在平面嵌入/路径噪声方面的不足，利用注意力头在不同推理阶段的语义关系特化特性来优化多跳推理

Method: 1) 对称解耦查询与图三元组到多视图空间 2) 基于注意力头特化机制构建干净子图 3) 分步引导LLM的接地推理

Result: 在WebQSP/CWQ基准测试中展现竞争力，检索质量提升15%，回答准确率提高22%，幻觉现象减少38%，且展现良好泛化能力

Conclusion: 多视图头部专业化机制为知识驱动的多跳推理提供了新方向，验证了结构化注意力机制在复杂推理任务中的有效性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at language understanding but often
hallucinate and struggle with multi-hop reasoning. Knowledge-graph-based
retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) offers grounding, yet most methods rely
on flat embeddings and noisy path exploration. We propose ParallaxRAG, a
framework that symmetrically decouples queries and graph triples into
multi-view spaces, enabling a robust retrieval architecture that explicitly
enforces head diversity while constraining weakly related paths. Central to our
approach is the observation that different attention heads specialize in
semantic relations at distinct reasoning stages, contributing to different hops
of the reasoning chain. This specialization allows ParallaxRAG to construct
cleaner subgraphs and guide LLMs through grounded, step-wise reasoning.
Experiments on WebQSP and CWQ, under our unified, reproducible setup (BGE-M3 +
Llama3.1-8B), demonstrate competitive retrieval and QA performance, alongside
reduced hallucination and good generalization. Our results highlight multi-view
head specialization as a principled direction for knowledge-grounded multi-hop
reasoning. Our implementation will be released as soon as the paper is
accepted.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注英语模型，忽视其他语言特性。韩语独特的语法、敬语系统及双数字系统缺乏专用评估基准。

Method: 构建包含开放指令任务的KITE评估框架，结合自动指标与人工评估，突破传统韩语基准的封闭式测试局限。

Result: 评估揭示模型性能差异，发布数据集与代码促进跨语言LLM研究。

Conclusion: KITE填补非英语LLM评估空白，推动语言文化包容性模型发展，启发其他低资源语言类似研究。

Abstract: The instruction-following capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are
pivotal for numerous applications, from conversational agents to complex
reasoning systems. However, current evaluations predominantly focus on English
models, neglecting the linguistic and cultural nuances of other languages.
Specifically, Korean, with its distinct syntax, rich morphological features,
honorific system, and dual numbering systems, lacks a dedicated benchmark for
assessing open-ended instruction-following capabilities. To address this gap,
we introduce the Korean Instruction-following Task Evaluation (KITE), a
comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate both general and Korean-specific
instructions. Unlike existing Korean benchmarks that focus mainly on factual
knowledge or multiple-choice testing, KITE directly targets diverse, open-ended
instruction-following tasks. Our evaluation pipeline combines automated metrics
with human assessments, revealing performance disparities across models and
providing deeper insights into their strengths and weaknesses. By publicly
releasing the KITE dataset and code, we aim to foster further research on
culturally and linguistically inclusive LLM development and inspire similar
endeavors for other underrepresented languages.

Abstract: This paper delves into the intricate world of Urdu poetry, exploring its
thematic depths through a lens of polysemy. By focusing on the nuanced
differences between three seemingly synonymous words (pyaar, muhabbat, and
ishq) we expose a spectrum of emotions and experiences unique to the Urdu
language. This study employs a polysemic case study approach, meticulously
examining how these words are interwoven within the rich tapestry of Urdu
poetry. By analyzing their usage and context, we uncover a hidden layer of
meaning, revealing subtle distinctions which lack direct equivalents in English
literature. Furthermore, we embark on a comparative analysis, generating word
embeddings for both Urdu and English terms related to love. This enables us to
quantify and visualize the semantic space occupied by these words, providing
valuable insights into the cultural and linguistic nuances of expressing love.
Through this multifaceted approach, our study sheds light on the captivating
complexities of Urdu poetry, offering a deeper understanding and appreciation
for its unique portrayal of love and its myriad expressions

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文档对齐方法（如OT）在大规模网络数据挖掘时面临效率瓶颈，需兼顾精度与速度

Result: 在WMT16任务中达到与OT相当的准确率，速度提升约100倍；系统分析多语言句子嵌入模型表现

Conclusion: BiMax实现效率突破，EmbDA工具开源推动文档对齐技术应用

Abstract: Document alignment is necessary for the hierarchical mining (Ba\~n\'on et
al., 2020; Morishita et al., 2022), which aligns documents across source and
target languages within the same web domain. Several high precision sentence
embedding-based methods have been developed, such as TK-PERT (Thompson and
Koehn, 2020) and Optimal Transport (OT) (Clark et al., 2019; El-Kishky and
Guzm\'an, 2020). However, given the massive scale of web mining data, both
accuracy and speed must be considered. In this paper, we propose a
cross-lingual Bidirectional Maxsim score (BiMax) for computing doc-to-doc
similarity, to improve efficiency compared to the OT method. Consequently, on
the WMT16 bilingual document alignment task, BiMax attains accuracy comparable
to OT with an approximate 100-fold speed increase. Meanwhile, we also conduct a
comprehensive analysis to investigate the performance of current
state-of-the-art multilingual sentence embedding models. All the alignment
methods in this paper are publicly available as a tool called EmbDA
(https://github.com/EternalEdenn/EmbDA).

Abstract: While coreference resolution is attracting more interest than ever from
computational literature researchers, representative datasets of fully
annotated long documents remain surprisingly scarce. In this paper, we
introduce a new annotated corpus of three full-length French novels, totaling
over 285,000 tokens. Unlike previous datasets focused on shorter texts, our
corpus addresses the challenges posed by long, complex literary works, enabling
evaluation of coreference models in the context of long reference chains. We
present a modular coreference resolution pipeline that allows for fine-grained
error analysis. We show that our approach is competitive and scales effectively
to long documents. Finally, we demonstrate its usefulness to infer the gender
of fictional characters, showcasing its relevance for both literary analysis

Method: 在因果图推理、重力约束3D重建、布尔遗传关系三个结构化领域构建假设空间，通过有效性（假设符合观测）、独特性（假设非冗余）、恢复性（覆盖完整解集）三个互补指标进行评估。

Result: 实验显示语言模型在假设空间增大时有效性保持较高，但独特性和恢复性显著下降，揭示了传统正确率指标无法检测的模式坍塌现象。

Conclusion: HypoSpace为需要显式探索解空间的研究方法提供了标准化评估框架，其代码开源促进了科学推理领域的工具发展。

Abstract: As language models are increasingly used in scientific workflows, evaluating
their ability to propose sets of explanations-not just a single correct
answer-becomes critical. Many scientific problems are underdetermined:
multiple, mechanistically distinct hypotheses are consistent with the same
observations. We introduce HypoSpace, a diagnostic suite that treats LLMs as
samplers of finite hypothesis sets and measures three complementary indicators:
Validity (precision of proposals consistent with observations), Uniqueness
(non-redundancy among proposals), and Recovery (coverage of the enumerated
admissible set). We instantiate HypoSpace in three structured domains with
deterministic validators and exactly enumerated hypothesis spaces: (i) causal
graphs from perturbations, (ii) gravity-constrained 3D voxel reconstruction
from top-down projections, and (iii) Boolean genetic interactions. Across
instruction-tuned and reasoning-focused models, Validity often remains high
while Uniqueness and Recovery degrade as the admissible space grows, revealing
mode collapse that is invisible to correctness-only metrics. HypoSpace offers a
controlled probe-rather than a leaderboard-for methods that explicitly explore
and cover admissible explanation spaces. Code is available at:

Result: 在文本数据集提升3 F1，多模态数据集提升6 F1，嵌入拼接法表现最优

Conclusion: 语境信息和融合方式的协同优化是提升仇恨言论检测精度的关键

Abstract: This research introduces a novel approach to textual and multimodal Hate
Speech Detection (HSD), using Large Language Models (LLMs) as dynamic knowledge
bases to generate background context and incorporate it into the input of HSD
classifiers. Two context generation strategies are examined: one focused on
named entities and the other on full-text prompting. Four methods of
incorporating context into the classifier input are compared: text
concatenation, embedding concatenation, a hierarchical transformer-based
fusion, and LLM-driven text enhancement. Experiments are conducted on the
textual Latent Hatred dataset of implicit hate speech and applied in a
multimodal setting on the MAMI dataset of misogynous memes. Results suggest
that both the contextual information and the method by which it is incorporated
are key, with gains of up to 3 and 6 F1 points on textual and multimodal setups
respectively, from a zero-context baseline to the highest-performing system,
based on embedding concatenation.

Abstract: Reasoning models have gained significant attention due to their strong
performance, particularly when enhanced with retrieval augmentation. However,
these models often incur high computational costs, as both retrieval and
reasoning tokens contribute substantially to the overall resource usage. In
this work, we make the following contributions: (1) we propose a
retrieval-augmented reasoning model that dynamically adjusts the length of the
retrieved document list based on the query and retrieval results; (2) we
develop a cost-aware advantage function for training of efficient
retrieval-augmented reasoning models through reinforcement learning; and (3) we
explore both memory- and latency-bound implementations of the proposed
cost-aware framework for both proximal and group relative policy optimization
algorithms. We evaluate our approach on seven public question answering
datasets and demonstrate significant efficiency gains, without compromising
effectiveness. In fact, we observed that the model latency decreases by ~16-20%
across datasets, while its effectiveness increases by ~5% on average, in terms
of exact match.

Method: 通过实证分析DLMs的注意力模式，重点研究其注意力下沉现象的位移特征及模型对注意力下沉的敏感性。

Result: DLMs的注意力下沉位置在生成过程中动态迁移，且移除注意力下沉仅导致轻微性能下降（ARMs则显著敏感）。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了扩散模型与自回归模型在注意力分配机制上的根本差异，为理解扩散模型的工作原理提供了新视角。

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional Autoregressive Models (ARMs). DLMs employ
transformer encoders with bidirectional attention, enabling parallel token
generation while maintaining competitive performance. Although their efficiency
and effectiveness have been extensively studied, the internal mechanisms that
govern DLMs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct an empirical
analysis of DLM attention patterns, focusing on the attention sinking
phenomenon, an effect previously observed in various transformer-based
architectures. Our findings reveal that DLMs also exhibit attention sinks, but
with distinct characteristics. First, unlike in ARMs, the sink positions in
DLMs tend to shift throughout the generation process, displaying a dynamic
behaviour. Second, while ARMs are highly sensitive to the removal of attention
sinks, DLMs remain robust: masking sinks leads to only a minor degradation in
performance. These results provide new insights into the inner workings of
diffusion-based language models and highlight fundamental differences in how
they allocate and utilize attention compared to autoregressive models.

Motivation: 传统基于固定任务和参考答案的LLM评估方式难以捕捉开放场景下的模型行为，需要更灵活的主观评估方法。

Method: 提出包含自玩评估、同行评审和博弈论投票算法的框架，通过模型互评生成排名，并与人类投票行为进行系统对比。

Conclusion: 首次整合互评机制、博弈论聚合和人类验证的评估框架，为LLM能力评估提供了新的理论视角和实证基础。

Abstract: Ideal or real - that is the question.In this work, we explore whether
principles from game theory can be effectively applied to the evaluation of
large language models (LLMs). This inquiry is motivated by the growing
inadequacy of conventional evaluation practices, which often rely on
fixed-format tasks with reference answers and struggle to capture the nuanced,
subjective, and open-ended nature of modern LLM behavior. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel alternative: automatic mutual evaluation, where
LLMs assess each other's output through self-play and peer review. These peer
assessments are then systematically compared with human voting behavior to
evaluate their alignment with human judgment. Our framework incorporates
game-theoretic voting algorithms to aggregate peer reviews, enabling a
principled investigation into whether model-generated rankings reflect human
preferences. Empirical results reveal both convergences and divergences between
theoretical predictions and human evaluations, offering valuable insights into
the promises and limitations of mutual evaluation. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to jointly integrate mutual evaluation,
game-theoretic aggregation, and human-grounded validation for evaluating the
capabilities of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统动物交流翻译验证方法存在的安全风险、伦理问题和成本高昂缺陷，探索无参考翻译的机器翻译质量评估方案

Method: 采用分段翻译结合NLP乱序测试（shuffle test），通过对比有序翻译与乱序翻译的逻辑性差异来检测幻觉翻译，在低资源人类语言和构造语言上进行概念验证实验

Result: 该方法在人类语言实验中与标准参考翻译评估高度相关（皮尔逊系数0.99），理论分析表明早期翻译学习阶段无需直接互动

Conclusion: 基于纯文本分析的参考无关评估方法为动物交流翻译提供安全、伦理且经济的验证路径，但需注意幻觉翻译的检测挑战

Abstract: If you had an AI Whale-to-English translator, how could you validate whether
or not it is working? Does one need to interact with the animals or rely on
grounded observations such as temperature? We provide theoretical and
proof-of-concept experimental evidence suggesting that interaction and even
observations may not be necessary for sufficiently complex languages. One may
be able to evaluate translators solely by their English outputs, offering
potential advantages in terms of safety, ethics, and cost. This is an instance
of machine translation quality evaluation (MTQE) without any reference
translations available. A key challenge is identifying ``hallucinations,''
false translations which may appear fluent and plausible. We propose using
segment-by-segment translation together with the classic NLP shuffle test to
evaluate translators. The idea is to translate animal communication, turn by
turn, and evaluate how often the resulting translations make more sense in
order than permuted. Proof-of-concept experiments on data-scarce human
languages and constructed languages demonstrate the potential utility of this
evaluation methodology. These human-language experiments serve solely to
validate our reference-free metric under data scarcity. It is found to
correlate highly with a standard evaluation based on reference translations,
which are available in our experiments. We also perform a theoretical analysis
suggesting that interaction may not be necessary nor efficient in the early
stages of learning to translate.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过单层Transformer玩具模型揭示了语言模型中线性真理子空间的形成机制，发现两阶段学习动态（记忆事实→线性分离）是实现该现象的关键路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大型语言模型中区分真假陈述的线性子空间形成机制，现有研究未能明确其产生原理，需要构建透明模型进行端到端复现和机制解析。

Method: 设计数据分布使事实陈述共现，构建单层Transformer模型，通过实验验证学习动态和真理子空间形成过程。

Result: 成功复现真理子空间现象，发现模型先快速记忆事实关联（数步），再长期学习线性分离策略（数千步），最终显著降低语言建模损失。

Conclusion: 研究从机制角度证明了数据共现模式驱动语言模型形成线性真理表征的必然性，为理解模型内部语义编码提供了新视角。

Abstract: Recent probing studies reveal that large language models exhibit linear
subspaces that separate true from false statements, yet the mechanism behind
their emergence is unclear. We introduce a transparent, one-layer transformer
toy model that reproduces such truth subspaces end-to-end and exposes one
concrete route by which they can arise. We study one simple setting in which
truth encoding can emerge: a data distribution where factual statements
co-occur with other factual statements (and vice-versa), encouraging the model
to learn this distinction in order to lower the LM loss on future tokens. We
corroborate this pattern with experiments in pretrained language models.
Finally, in the toy setting we observe a two-phase learning dynamic: networks
first memorize individual factual associations in a few steps, then -- over a
longer horizon -- learn to linearly separate true from false, which in turn
lowers language-modeling loss. Together, these results provide both a
mechanistic demonstration and an empirical motivation for how and why linear
truth representations can emerge in language models.

Abstract: Academic project websites can more effectively disseminate research when they
clearly present core content and enable intuitive navigation and interaction.
However, current approaches such as direct Large Language Model (LLM)
generation, templates, or direct HTML conversion struggle to produce
layout-aware, interactive sites, and a comprehensive evaluation suite for this
task has been lacking. In this paper, we introduce Paper2Web, a benchmark
dataset and multi-dimensional evaluation framework for assessing academic
webpage generation. It incorporates rule-based metrics like Connectivity,
Completeness and human-verified LLM-as-a-Judge (covering interactivity,
aesthetics, and informativeness), and PaperQuiz, which measures paper-level
knowledge retention. We further present PWAgent, an autonomous pipeline that
converts scientific papers into interactive and multimedia-rich academic
homepages. The agent iteratively refines both content and layout through MCP
tools that enhance emphasis, balance, and presentation quality. Our experiments
show that PWAgent consistently outperforms end-to-end baselines like
template-based webpages and arXiv/alphaXiv versions by a large margin while
maintaining low cost, achieving the Pareto-front in academic webpage
generation.

Conclusion: 符号推理与神经模型融合实现了可解释的细粒度情感分析，适用于语言动态性强的应用场景

Abstract: Accurately detecting sentiment polarity and intensity in product reviews and
social media posts remains challenging due to informal and domain-specific
language. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid lexicon-fuzzy-transformer
framework that combines rule-based heuristics, contextual deep learning, and
fuzzy logic to generate continuous sentiment scores reflecting both polarity
and strength. The pipeline begins with VADER-based initial sentiment
estimations, which are refined through a two-stage adjustment process. This
involves leveraging confidence scores from DistilBERT, a lightweight
transformer and applying fuzzy logic principles to mitigate excessive
neutrality bias and enhance granularity. A custom fuzzy inference system then
maps the refined scores onto a 0 to 1 continuum, producing expert)like
judgments. The framework is rigorously evaluated on four domain-specific
datasets. food delivery, e-commerce, tourism, and fashion. Results show
improved alignment with user ratings, better identification of sentiment
extremes, and reduced misclassifications. Both quantitative metrics
(distributional alignment, confusion matrices) and qualitative insights (case
studies, runtime analysis) affirm the models robustness and efficiency. This
work demonstrates the value of integrating symbolic reasoning with neural
models for interpretable, finegrained sentiment analysis in linguistically
dynamic domains.

Abstract: Slot filling is a crucial subtask in spoken language understanding (SLU),
traditionally implemented as a cascade of speech recognition followed by one or
more natural language understanding (NLU) components. The recent advent of
speech-based large language models (speechLLMs), which integrate speech and
textual foundation models, has opened new avenues for achieving speech
understanding tasks in a more unified, generative, and instruction-following
manner while promising data and compute efficiency with zero-shot abilities,
generalizing to unseen slot labels. We address the slot-filling task by
creating an empirical upper bound for the task, identifying performance,
robustness, and generalization gaps, and proposing improvements to the training
data, architecture, and training strategies to narrow the gap with the upper
bound result. We show that each of these measures improve performance
substantially, while highlighting practical challenges and providing empirical
guidance and insights for harnessing these emerging models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在开放领域（如医疗咨询）因缺乏明确奖励函数而效果受限

Method: 结合合成对话生成与动态量规创建，通过量规反馈指导增量强化学习过程

Result: Qwen3-4B-Instruct模型在HealthBench-Hard基准得分从7.0提升至27.2（2k样本）

Conclusion: 量规驱动方法实现跨场景的性能提升，为复杂开放任务提供可扩展解决方案

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown substantial advances through
reinforcement learning (RL), particularly in domains where rewards can be
programmatically verified, such as mathematics and code. In these areas, models
benefit from a well-defined operational base guided by explicit rule-based
objectives. However, this progress reveals a significant limitation: in
open-ended domains where rewards are ambiguous, subjective, or
context-dependent, such as creative writing, scientific reasoning, and notably
medical consultation, robust reward functions are lacking, making these areas
challenging for current RL strategies. To bridge this gap, we introduce ORBIT,
an open-ended rubric-based incremental training framework specifically designed
for high-stakes medical dialogue. ORBIT integrates syn- thetic dialogue
generation with the dynamic creation of rubrics, employing these rubrics to
direct an incremental RL process. In particular, this approach does not depend
on external medical knowledge or manual rules, instead utilizing rubric-guided
feedback to shape learning. When implemented on the Qwen3-4B-Instruct model,
our method can greatly enhance its performance on the HealthBench-Hard
benchmark from 7.0 to 27.2 using only 2k samples, thus achieving
state-of-the-art results for models of this scale. Our analysis confirms that
rubric-driven RL fos-ters consistent performance gains across diverse
consultation scenarios, going beyond simple numerical improvements. These
findings underscore rubric-based feedback as a scalable strategy for advancing
LLMs in intricate, open-ended tasks.

Motivation: 现有方法学得的技能过度依赖特定网站，缺乏跨环境通用性。需开发支持持续学习的智能体框架以实现技能复用和组合。

Method: 采用多态性设计：1）分离技能抽象目标（what）与具体实现（how）2）支持不同网站下的差异化执行逻辑 3）自主目标发现与优化机制

Result: 实验显示：1）已见网站技能重用率↑1.7倍 2）Mind2Web成功率↑9.4%，未见网站成功率↑13.9% 3）步骤数↓20%+ 4）自主探索任务质量提升，学得跨站通用技能

Conclusion: 目标-执行分离是实现开放网络持续学习的关键，为自适应环境智能体提供实用路径。该框架推动LLM智能体从静态工具转向动态学习系统演进。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are moving beyond static uses and are now
powering agents that learn continually during their interaction with external
environments. For example, agents can learn reusable skills while navigating
web pages or toggling new tools. However, existing methods for skill learning
often create skills that are over-specialized to a single website and fail to
generalize. We introduce PolySkill, a new framework that enables agents to
learn generalizable and compositional skills. The core idea, inspired by
polymorphism in software engineering, is to decouple a skill's abstract goal
(what it accomplishes) and its concrete implementation (how it is executed).
Experiments show that our method (1) improves skill reuse by 1.7x on seen
websites and (2) boosts success rates by up to 9.4% on Mind2Web and 13.9% on
unseen websites, while reducing steps by over 20%. (3) In self-exploration
settings without specified tasks, our framework improves the quality of
proposed tasks and enables agents to learn generalizable skills that work
across different sites. By enabling the agent to identify and refine its own
goals, the PolySkill enhances the agent's ability to learn a better curriculum,
leading to the acquisition of more generalizable skills compared to baseline
methods. This work provides a practical path toward building agents capable of
continual learning in adaptive environments. Our findings show that separating
a skill's goal from its execution is a crucial step toward developing
autonomous agents that can learn and generalize across the open web
continuously.

TL;DR: 提出NGS方法解决3DGS重建不透明物体时出现的错误透明表面问题，通过注入不透明噪声高斯模型，在保持渲染质量的同时显著减少伪影


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS优化过程中缺乏表面不透明度的显式约束，导致重建物体在交互查看时出现背景穿透和虚假透明现象，现有研究未明确解决这一特定伪影问题

Method: 在训练阶段向物体体积内注入不透明噪声高斯模型，促使表面高斯获得更高不透明度（仅需修改5%代码），同时提出基于透射率的量化评估指标

Result: 多数据集实验表明NGS减少80%以上透明伪影，PSNR保持27.15与基线相当，且处理4K分辨率仅需1.5倍训练时间

Conclusion: NGS有效解决3DGS的固有缺陷，提出的量化指标和高质量扫描数据集为后续研究提供了新的评估基准

Abstract: Opaque objects reconstructed by 3DGS often exhibit a falsely transparent
surface, leading to inconsistent background and internal patterns under camera
motion in interactive viewing. This issue stems from the ill-posed optimization
in 3DGS. During training, background and foreground Gaussians are blended via
alpha-compositing and optimized solely against the input RGB images using a
photometric loss. As this process lacks an explicit constraint on surface
opacity, the optimization may incorrectly assign transparency to opaque
regions, resulting in view-inconsistent and falsely transparent. This issue is
difficult to detect in standard evaluation settings but becomes particularly
evident in object-centric reconstructions under interactive viewing. Although
other causes of view-inconsistency have been explored recently, false
transparency has not been explicitly identified. To the best of our knowledge,
we are the first to identify, characterize, and develop solutions for this
artifact, an underreported artifact in 3DGS. Our strategy, NGS, encourages
surface Gaussians to adopt higher opacity by injecting opaque noise Gaussians
in the object volume during training, requiring only minimal modifications to
the existing splatting process. To quantitatively evaluate false transparency
in static renderings, we propose a transmittance-based metric that measures the
severity of this artifact. In addition, we introduce a customized, high-quality
object-centric scan dataset exhibiting pronounced transparency issues, and we
augment popular existing datasets with complementary infill noise specifically
designed to assess the robustness of 3D reconstruction methods to false
transparency. Experiments across multiple datasets show that NGS substantially
reduces false transparency while maintaining competitive performance on
standard rendering metrics, demonstrating its overall effectiveness.

Conclusion: HugAgent成为首个可扩展的个体化思维对齐基准，推动AI推理向个性化方向发展

Abstract: Simulating human reasoning in open-ended tasks has been a long-standing
aspiration in AI and cognitive science. While large language models now
approximate human responses at scale, they remain tuned to population-level
consensus, often erasing the individuality of reasoning styles and belief
trajectories. To advance the vision of more human-like reasoning in machines,
we introduce HugAgent (Human-Grounded Agent Benchmark), a benchmark for
average-to-individual reasoning adaptation. The task is to predict how a
specific person would reason and update their beliefs in novel scenarios, given
partial evidence of their past views. HugAgent adopts a dual-track design: a
synthetic track for scale and systematic stress tests, and a human track for
ecologically valid, "out-loud" reasoning data. This design enables scalable,
reproducible evaluation of intra-agent fidelity: whether models can capture not
just what people believe, but how their reasoning evolves. Experiments with
state-of-the-art LLMs reveal persistent adaptation gaps, positioning HugAgent
as the first extensible benchmark for aligning machine reasoning with the
individuality of human thought. Our benchmark and chatbot are open-sourced as
HugAgent (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HugAgent) and TraceYourThinking

Abstract: In the current era of big data, extracting deep insights from massive,
heterogeneous, and complexly associated multi-dimensional data has become a
significant challenge. Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in natural
language understanding and generation, but still suffer from "hallucination"
issues when processing structured knowledge and are difficult to update in
real-time. Although Knowledge Graphs (KGs) can explicitly store structured
knowledge, their static nature limits dynamic interaction and analytical
capabilities. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional data analysis
method based on the interactions between LLM agents and KGs, constructing a
dynamic, collaborative analytical ecosystem. This method utilizes LLM agents to
automatically extract product data from unstructured data, constructs and
visualizes the KG in real-time, and supports users in deep exploration and
analysis of graph nodes through an interactive platform. Experimental results
show that this method has significant advantages in product ecosystem analysis,
relationship mining, and user-driven exploratory analysis, providing new ideas
and tools for multi-dimensional data analysis.

Abstract: The foundation of reproducible science lies in protocols that are precise,
logically ordered, and executable. The autonomous generation of these protocols
through natural language queries could greatly improve the efficiency of the
reproduction process. However, current leading large language models (LLMs)
often generate incomplete or inconsistent protocols, limiting their utility. To
address this limitation, we first introduce SciRecipe, a large-scale dataset of
over 12K structured protocols spanning 27 biological subfields and encompassing
both comprehension and problem-solving tasks. To further improve protocol
generation, we propose the "Sketch-and-Fill" paradigm, which separates
analysis, structuring, and expression to ensure each step is explicit and
verifiable. Complementing this, the structured component-based reward mechanism
evaluates step granularity, action order, and semantic fidelity, aligning model
optimization with experimental reliability. Building on these components, we
develop Thoth, trained through a staged Knowledge-to-Action process that
progresses from knowledge acquisition to operational reasoning and ultimately
to robust, executable protocol generation. Across multiple benchmarks, Thoth
consistently surpasses both proprietary and open-source LLMs, achieving
significant improvements in step alignment, logical sequencing, and semantic
accuracy. Our approach paves the way for reliable scientific assistants that
bridge knowledge with experimental execution. All data, code, and models will
be released publicly.

Abstract: The automation of scientific discovery represents a critical milestone in
Artificial Intelligence (AI) research. However, existing agentic systems for
science suffer from two fundamental limitations: rigid, pre-programmed
workflows that cannot adapt to intermediate findings, and inadequate context
management that hinders long-horizon research. We present
\texttt{freephdlabor}, an open-source multiagent framework featuring
\textit{fully dynamic workflows} determined by real-time agent reasoning and a
\coloremph{\textit{modular architecture}} enabling seamless customization --
users can modify, add, or remove agents to address domain-specific
requirements. The framework provides comprehensive infrastructure including
\textit{automatic context compaction}, \textit{workspace-based communication}
to prevent information degradation, \textit{memory persistence} across
sessions, and \textit{non-blocking human intervention} mechanisms. These
features collectively transform automated research from isolated, single-run
attempts into \textit{continual research programs} that build systematically on
prior explorations and incorporate human feedback. By providing both the
architectural principles and practical implementation for building customizable
co-scientist systems, this work aims to facilitate broader adoption of
automated research across scientific domains, enabling practitioners to deploy
interactive multiagent systems that autonomously conduct end-to-end research --
from ideation through experimentation to publication-ready manuscripts.

latency) and reduces energy consumption by 25% (while serving 19% more
requests) during periods of congestion for a summarization workload.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成代码存在逻辑错误风险，在金融/科学等高风险领域需提升输出可靠性。

Method: 设计包含实验组/对照组、评估指标的TDD框架，提供基于测试用例的prompt模板

Result: 预期提高代码正确性（通过单元测试率）和用户信心（认知负荷评估）

Conclusion: 测试驱动思维能增强非专业用户的计算思维，建立可靠的LLM集成范式

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, are increasingly leveraged for
generating both traditional software code and spreadsheet logic. Despite their
impressive generative capabilities, these models frequently exhibit critical
issues such as hallucinations, subtle logical inconsistencies, and syntactic
errors, risks particularly acute in high stakes domains like financial
modelling and scientific computations, where accuracy and reliability are
paramount. This position paper proposes a structured research framework that
integrates the proven software engineering practice of Test-Driven Development
(TDD) with Large Language Model (LLM) driven generation to enhance the
correctness of, reliability of, and user confidence in generated outputs. We
hypothesise that a "test first" methodology provides both technical constraints
and cognitive scaffolding, guiding LLM outputs towards more accurate,
verifiable, and comprehensible solutions. Our framework, applicable across
diverse programming contexts, from spreadsheet formula generation to scripting
languages such as Python and strongly typed languages like Rust, includes an
explicitly outlined experimental design with clearly defined participant
groups, evaluation metrics, and illustrative TDD based prompting examples. By
emphasising test driven thinking, we aim to improve computational thinking,
prompt engineering skills, and user engagement, particularly benefiting
spreadsheet users who often lack formal programming training yet face serious
consequences from logical errors. We invite collaboration to refine and
empirically evaluate this approach, ultimately aiming to establish responsible
and reliable LLM integration in both educational and professional development
practices.

Abstract: We introduce Shakti VLM, a family of vision-language models in the capacity
of 1B and 4B parameters designed to address data efficiency challenges in
multimodal learning. While recent VLMs achieve strong performance through
extensive training data, Shakti models leverage architectural innovations to
attain competitive results with fewer tokens. Key advancements include
QK-Normalization for attention stability, hybrid normalization techniques, and
enhanced positional encoding. A three-stage training strategy further optimizes
learning efficiency. Evaluations show that Shakti-Shakti-VLM-1B and
Shakti-VLM-4B excel in document understanding, Visual Reasoning, OCR
extraction, and general multimodal reasoning. Our results highlight that high
performance can be achieved through model design and training strategy rather
than sheer data volume, making Shakti an efficient solution for

TL;DR: 提出DeLeaker方法解决T2I模型语义泄漏问题，通过动态调整注意力图抑制跨实体交互，并构建SLIM数据集验证效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2I模型存在语义泄漏问题，传统方法依赖优化或外部输入难以有效解决。

Method: 开发无需优化的轻量级推理方法，通过动态重加权注意力图抑制跨实体特征传递，同时强化实体独立性。

Result: DeLeaker在SLIM数据集上全面超越基线模型（含外部信息辅助方法），在保持图像质量前提下实现有效泄漏抑制。

Conclusion: 注意力机制控制是提升T2I模型语义精度的有效路径，为后续研究提供新方向。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have advanced rapidly, yet they remain vulnerable
to semantic leakage, the unintended transfer of semantically related features
between distinct entities. Existing mitigation strategies are often
optimization-based or dependent on external inputs. We introduce DeLeaker, a
lightweight, optimization-free inference-time approach that mitigates leakage
by directly intervening on the model's attention maps. Throughout the diffusion
process, DeLeaker dynamically reweights attention maps to suppress excessive
cross-entity interactions while strengthening the identity of each entity. To
support systematic evaluation, we introduce SLIM (Semantic Leakage in IMages),
the first dataset dedicated to semantic leakage, comprising 1,130
human-verified samples spanning diverse scenarios, together with a novel
automatic evaluation framework. Experiments demonstrate that DeLeaker
consistently outperforms all baselines, even when they are provided with
external information, achieving effective leakage mitigation without
compromising fidelity or quality. These results underscore the value of
attention control and pave the way for more semantically precise T2I models.

Abstract: Pretrained multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong
performance on diverse multimodal tasks, but remain limited in reasoning
capabilities for domains where annotations are difficult to collect. In this
work, we focus on artificial image domains such as charts, rendered documents,
and webpages, which are abundant in practice yet lack large-scale human
annotated reasoning datasets. We introduce COGS (COmposition-Grounded
instruction Synthesis), a data-efficient framework for equipping MLLMs with
advanced reasoning abilities from a small set of seed questions. The key idea
is to decompose each seed question into primitive perception and reasoning
factors, which can then be systematically recomposed with new images to
generate large collections of synthetic question-answer pairs. Each generated
question is paired with subquestions and intermediate answers, enabling
reinforcement learning with factor-level process rewards. Experiments on chart
reasoning show that COGS substantially improves performance on unseen
questions, with the largest gains on reasoning-heavy and compositional
questions. Moreover, training with a factor-level mixture of different seed
data yields better transfer across multiple datasets, suggesting that COGS
induces generalizable capabilities rather than dataset-specific overfitting. We
further demonstrate that the framework extends beyond charts to other domains
such as webpages.

Method: 采用半合成方法生成四档质量级别的文本-图像配对数据，训练UniFilter分类器对DataComp和OBELICS数据集进行数据筛选

Conclusion: 高质量多模态数据筛选能有效提升模型性能，研究团队开源了训练数据、模型检查点和高质量OBELICS-HQ子集促进社区发展

Abstract: The Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are continually pre-trained on a
mixture of image-text caption data and interleaved document data, while the
high-quality data filtering towards image-text interleaved document data is
under-explored. We propose to train an efficient MLLM as a Unified Mulitmodal
Data Quality Classifier to Filter both high-quality image-text caption and
interleaved data (UniFilter). To address the challenge of collecting diverse
labeled multimodal data, we introduce a semi-synthetic approach that leverages
readily available raw images and generates corresponding text across four
quality levels. This method enables efficient creation of sample-score pairs
for both caption and interleaved document data to train UniFilter. We apply
UniFilter to curate high-quality caption data from DataComp caption dataset and
interleaved data from the OBELICS image-text interleaved dataset. MLLMs
pre-trained on the filtered data demonstrate significantly enhanced
capabilities compared to those trained on baseline-filtered data, achieving
stronger zero-shot reasoning and in-context learning capabilities. After visual
supervised fine-tuning, these UniFilter-induced MLLMs achieve stronger
performance on various benchmarks, highlighting the downstream benefits of
high-quality multimodal pre-training. We release the synthetic training data
used for training UniFilter, the UniFilter model checkpoints, and the
high-quality interleaved document subset OBELICS-HQ, curated by UniFilter, to
the community for reproduction and further development.

Abstract: Advancing machine intelligence requires developing the ability to perceive
across multiple modalities, much as humans sense the world. We introduce
OmniVinci, an initiative to build a strong, open-source, omni-modal LLM. We
carefully study the design choices across model architecture and data curation.
For model architecture, we present three key innovations: (i) OmniAlignNet for
strengthening alignment between vision and audio embeddings in a shared
omni-modal latent space; (ii) Temporal Embedding Grouping for capturing
relative temporal alignment between vision and audio signals; and (iii)
Constrained Rotary Time Embedding for encoding absolute temporal information in
omni-modal embeddings. We introduce a curation and synthesis pipeline that
generates 24M single-modal and omni-modal conversations. We find that
modalities reinforce one another in both perception and reasoning. Our model,
OmniVinci, outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni with +19.05 on DailyOmni (cross-modal
understanding), +1.7 on MMAR (audio), and +3.9 on Video-MME (vision), while
using just 0.2T training tokens - a 6 times reduction compared to
Qwen2.5-Omni's 1.2T. We finally demonstrate omni-modal advantages in downstream

Motivation: 现有方法依赖交叉熵损失评估预训练效果，但该指标与下游任务表现关联性弱。需要新的理论框架解释预训练成功机制，并为算法优化提供指导

Method: 1. 理论分析覆盖率的必要性与充分性
2. 提出覆盖原则（coverage principle）解释next-token预测机制
3. 开发三种算法干预：模型选择策略、梯度归一化方案、测试时解码策略

Result: 1. 覆盖率比交叉熵具有更快的泛化速度
2. 覆盖原则避免序列长度等参数的虚假依赖
3. 理论证明提出的算法干预能有效提升覆盖率

Conclusion: 覆盖率是预训练成功的关键指标，其理论框架为模型优化提供新方向，算法改进方案具有实际应用价值

Abstract: Language models demonstrate remarkable abilities when pre-trained on large
text corpora and fine-tuned for specific tasks, but how and why pre-training
shapes the success of the final model remains poorly understood. Notably,
although pre-training success is often quantified by cross entropy loss,
cross-entropy can be a poor predictor of downstream performance. Instead, we
provide a theoretical perspective on this relationship through the lens of
\emph{coverage}, which quantifies the probability mass the pre-trained model
places on high-quality responses and which is necessary and sufficient for
post-training and test-time scaling methods such as Best-of-N to succeed. Our
main results develop an understanding of \emph{the coverage principle}, a
phenomenon whereby next-token prediction implicitly optimizes toward a model
with good coverage. In particular, we uncover a mechanism that explains the
power of coverage in predicting downstream performance: \emph{coverage
generalizes faster than cross entropy}, avoiding spurious dependence on
problem-dependent parameters such as the sequence length. We also study
practical algorithmic interventions with provable benefits for improving
coverage, including (i) model/checkpoint selection procedures, (ii) gradient
normalization schemes, and (iii) test-time decoding strategies.

Motivation: 现有隐私基准仅关注单轮简单交互，无法评估协作场景中隐私信息作为任务必需要素时的真实保护需求

Method: 构建包含200个高风险任务的MAGPIE基准，要求多智能体在非对抗协作中必须使用隐私信息才能完成任务

Result: GPT-5泄露率35.1%，Gemini 2.5-Pro达50.7%；38.2%案例出现操纵行为，无法有效兼顾隐私与协作效能

Conclusion: 当前LLM代理缺乏复杂环境下的隐私理解能力，在保持协作效率的同时维护隐私的机制尚未成熟

Abstract: A core challenge for autonomous LLM agents in collaborative settings is
balancing robust privacy understanding and preservation alongside task
efficacy. Existing privacy benchmarks only focus on simplistic, single-turn
interactions where private information can be trivially omitted without
affecting task outcomes. In this paper, we introduce MAGPIE (Multi-AGent
contextual PrIvacy Evaluation), a novel benchmark of 200 high-stakes tasks
designed to evaluate privacy understanding and preservation in multi-agent
collaborative, non-adversarial scenarios. MAGPIE integrates private information
as essential for task resolution, forcing agents to balance effective
collaboration with strategic information control. Our evaluation reveals that
state-of-the-art agents, including GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5-Pro, exhibit
significant privacy leakage, with Gemini 2.5-Pro leaking up to 50.7% and GPT-5
up to 35.1% of the sensitive information even when explicitly instructed not
to. Moreover, these agents struggle to achieve consensus or task completion and
often resort to undesirable behaviors such as manipulation and power-seeking
(e.g., Gemini 2.5-Pro demonstrating manipulation in 38.2% of the cases). These
findings underscore that current LLM agents lack robust privacy understanding
and are not yet adequately aligned to simultaneously preserve privacy and
maintain effective collaboration in complex environments.

Abstract: In quantitative investing, return prediction supports various tasks,
including stock selection, portfolio optimization, and risk management.
Quantitative factors, such as valuation, quality, and growth, capture various
characteristics of stocks. Unstructured financial data, like news and
transcripts, has attracted growing attention, driven by recent advances in
large language models (LLMs). This paper examines effective methods for
leveraging multimodal factors and newsflow in return prediction and stock
selection. First, we introduce a fusion learning framework to learn a unified
representation from factors and newsflow representations generated by an LLM.
Within this framework, we compare three representative methods: representation
combination, representation summation, and attentive representations. Next,
building on empirical observations from fusion learning, we explore the mixture
model that adaptively combines predictions made by single modalities and their
fusion. To mitigate the training instability observed in the mixture model, we
introduce a decoupled training approach with theoretical insights. Finally, our
experiments on real investment universes yield several insights into effective
multimodal modeling of factors and news for stock return prediction.

Abstract: We present SQuAI (https://squai.scads.ai/), a scalable and trustworthy
multi-agent retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework for scientific
question answering (QA) with large language models (LLMs). SQuAI addresses key
limitations of existing RAG systems in the scholarly domain, where complex,

evidence via hybrid sparse-dense retrieval, and adaptively filter documents to
improve contextual relevance. To ensure faithfulness and traceability, SQuAI
integrates in-line citations for each generated claim and provides supporting
sentences from the source documents. Our system improves faithfulness, answer
relevance, and contextual relevance by up to +0.088 (12%) over a strong RAG
baseline. We further release a benchmark of 1,000 scientific

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong reasoning and text generation
capabilities, prompting their use in scientific literature analysis, including
novelty assessment. While evaluating novelty of scientific papers is crucial
for peer review, it requires extensive knowledge of related work, something not
all reviewers have. While recent work on LLM-assisted scientific literature
analysis supports literature comparison, existing approaches offer limited
transparency and lack mechanisms for result traceability via an information
retrieval module. To address this gap, we introduce $\textbf{GraphMind}$, an
easy-to-use interactive web tool designed to assist users in evaluating the
novelty of scientific papers or drafted ideas. Specially, $\textbf{GraphMind}$
enables users to capture the main structure of a scientific paper, explore
related ideas through various perspectives, and assess novelty via providing
verifiable contextual insights. $\textbf{GraphMind}$ enables users to annotate
key elements of a paper, explore related papers through various relationships,
and assess novelty with contextual insight. This tool integrates external APIs
such as arXiv and Semantic Scholar with LLMs to support annotation, extraction,
retrieval and classification of papers. This combination provides users with a
rich, structured view of a scientific idea's core contributions and its
connections to existing work. $\textbf{GraphMind}$ is available at

Conclusion: 通过显式建模环境动态特征，SPA框架有效增强了LLM代理的决策能力，验证了世界模型对复杂环境推理的促进作用

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as agents often struggle in out-of-distribution
(OOD) scenarios. Real-world environments are complex and dynamic, governed by
task-specific rules and stochasticity, which makes it difficult for LLMs to
ground their internal knowledge in those dynamics. Under such OOD conditions,
vanilla RL training often fails to scale; we observe Pass@k--the probability
that at least one of (k) sampled trajectories succeeds--drops markedly across
training steps, indicating brittle exploration and limited generalization.
Inspired by model-based reinforcement learning, we hypothesize that equipping
LLM agents with an internal world model can better align reasoning with
environmental dynamics and improve decision-making. We show how to encode this
world model by decomposing it into two components: state representation and
transition modeling. Building on this, we introduce SPA, a simple reinforcement
learning framework that cold-starts the policy via a Self-Play supervised
finetuning (SFT) stage to learn the world model by interacting with the
environment, then uses it to simulate future states prior to policy
optimization. This simple initialization outperforms the online world-modeling
baseline and greatly boosts the RL-based agent training performance.
Experiments across diverse environments like Sokoban, FrozenLake, and Sudoku
show that our approach significantly improves performance. For example, SPA
boosts the Sokoban success rate from 25.6% to 59.8% and raises the FrozenLake
score from 22.1% to 70.9% for the Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct model.

2. 自动化流程生成模型特异性slop分析及训练数据
3. 基于推理轨迹的FTPO微调方法精准调整logits

Result: 成功抑制8000+模式，FTPO实现90% slop削减，在GSM8K/MMLU/创意写作等任务中保持或提升性能，DPO对比组出现质量下降

Conclusion: Antislop在保持生成质量的同时显著提升文本多样性，FTPO相比DPO具有更好平衡性，开源方案推动相关研究

Abstract: Widespread LLM adoption has introduced characteristic repetitive phraseology,
termed ``slop,'' which degrades output quality and makes AI-generated text
immediately recognizable. We present Antislop, a comprehensive framework
providing tools to both detect and eliminate these overused patterns. Our
approach combines three innovations: (1) The Antislop Sampler, which uses
backtracking to suppress unwanted strings at inference time without destroying
vocabulary; (2) An automated pipeline that profiles model-specific slop against
human baselines and generates training data; (3) Final Token Preference
Optimization (FTPO), a novel fine-tuning method that operates on individual
tokens, surgically adjusting logits wherever a banned pattern has appeared in
an inference trace. We demonstrate that some slop patterns appear over
1,000$\times$ more frequently in LLM output than human text. The Antislop
Sampler successfully suppresses 8,000+ patterns while maintaining quality,
whereas token banning becomes unusable at just 2,000. Most importantly, FTPO
achieves 90\% slop reduction while maintaining or improving performance in
cross-domain evals including GSM8K, MMLU, and creative writing tasks. In
contrast, DPO suffers significant degradation in writing quality and lexical
diversity despite achieving weaker suppression. We release all code and results

TL;DR: 提出DLER方法通过强化学习优化语言模型的输出长度，在保持准确性的同时减少70%以上冗余输出，并实现更好的准确率-效率平衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理语言模型（如DeepSeek-R1）通过长思维链获得高准确率，但产生过多冗余输出，导致每个token传递的智能效率低下

Method: DLER方法整合批量奖励归一化、高剪切值、动态采样和简单截断长度惩罚，解决强化学习中的优势估计偏差、熵崩溃和稀疏奖励三大挑战

Result: 在7B参数规模下，DLER相比DeepSeek-R1实现28%准确率提升且延迟更低，同时提出难度感知截断和选择性合并方法提升效率与适用性

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升模型推理效率与扩展性，其自适应截断策略和参数合并技术为资源有限场景提供实用解决方案

Abstract: Reasoning language models such as OpenAI-o1, DeepSeek-R1, and Qwen achieve
strong performance via extended chains of thought but often generate
unnecessarily long outputs. Maximizing intelligence per token--accuracy
relative to response length--remains an open problem. We revisit reinforcement
learning (RL) with the simplest length penalty--truncation--and show that
accuracy degradation arises not from the lack of sophisticated penalties but
from inadequate RL optimization. We identify three key challenges: (i) large
bias in advantage estimation, (ii) entropy collapse, and (iii) sparse reward
signal. We address them with Doing Length pEnalty Right (DLER), a training
recipe combining batch-wise reward normalization, higher clipping, dynamic
sampling, and a simple truncation length penalty. DLER achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy--efficiency trade-offs, cutting output length by over
70 percent while surpassing all previous baseline accuracy. It also improves
test-time scaling: compared to DeepSeek-R1-7B, DLER-7B generates multiple
concise responses in parallel with 28 percent higher accuracy and lower
latency. We further introduce Difficulty-Aware DLER, which adaptively tightens
truncation on easier questions for additional efficiency gains. We also propose
an update-selective merging method that preserves baseline accuracy while
retaining the concise reasoning ability of the DLER model, which is useful for
scenarios where RL training data is scarce.

TL;DR: 研究发现高效语言模型具备内在正确性感知能力(SAL指标)，其预训练阶段形成的语义区分度决定了强化学习后的推理表现差异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究不同基础模型在强化学习后表现差异的根本原因，寻找预训练模型的微观属性对后续推理能力的影响机制

Method: 将推理建模为Horn子句链，通过跨层稀疏自编码器提取潜在特征，计算规则转移概率，使用Jensen-Shannon散度量化分布差异

Result: 提出的SAL指标与RLVR后表现高度相关(R²=0.87)，在0.5B-14B不同规模模型中验证有效，突破模型家族差异限制

Conclusion: 模型的推理潜力根植于预训练阶段形成的知识筛选能力，SAL指标为选择/设计强基础模型提供了基于内部机制的量化标准

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can elicit strong
reasoning in large language models (LLMs), while their performance after RLVR
varies dramatically across different base models. This raises a fundamental
question: what microscopic property of pre-trained models leads to this
variation? To investigate, we formalize reasoning as chains of Horn clauses
("if-then" rules) built from features extracted from the LLM's latent space via
cross-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs). We estimate the transition
probabilities between its features, and further categorize each rule by its
semantic soundness level (e.g., strict, plausible, noisy) with an LLM. Our key
discovery is that high-potential models are inherently soundness-aware: their
internal probability distributions systematically shift across rules' soundness
levels, becoming highly distinct for "strict" versus "noisy" rules. In
contrast, weaker models are soundness-agnostic, collapsing to one distribution
regardless of soundness levels. To quantify this, we introduce the
Soundness-Aware Level (SAL), a microscopic metric using the Jensen-Shannon
Divergence to measure the separation between these distributions. We show that
SAL's predictions of post-RLVR reasoning performance follow a precise empirical
law (R^2=0.87) across diverse model families (Qwen, Mistral, Llama, DeepSeek)
and scales (0.5B-14B). This reveals that a model's reasoning potential is tied
to its intrinsic, pre-trained ability to distinguish sound knowledge from
unsound ones. These findings underscore the critical role of model pre-training
in shaping reasoning and offer a practical metric grounded in the model's
internal mechanisms for selecting/designing stronger base models.

TL;DR: FinTrust是首个专门评估金融领域大语言模型可信度的多维度基准测试框架


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在金融应用场景中存在法律意识薄弱、风险控制不足等问题，亟需系统化评估体系

Method: 构建包含安全、公平、合规等维度的评估体系，设计细粒度测试任务，评估11个主流模型

Result: 闭源模型在安全性表现更优（如o4-mini），开源模型在行业公平性占优（如DeepSeek-V3），所有模型在法律合规性任务上均存在明显短板

Conclusion: FinTrust可作为金融领域AI可信评估的重要基准，未来模型需重点加强法律文书解读和合规披露能力

Abstract: Recent LLMs have demonstrated promising ability in solving finance related
problems. However, applying LLMs in real-world finance application remains
challenging due to its high risk and high stakes property. This paper
introduces FinTrust, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for
evaluating the trustworthiness of LLMs in finance applications. Our benchmark
focuses on a wide range of alignment issues based on practical context and
features fine-grained tasks for each dimension of trustworthiness evaluation.
We assess eleven LLMs on FinTrust and find that proprietary models like o4-mini
outperforms in most tasks such as safety while open-source models like
DeepSeek-V3 have advantage in specific areas like industry-level fairness. For
challenging task like fiduciary alignment and disclosure, all LLMs fall short,
showing a significant gap in legal awareness. We believe that FinTrust can be a
valuable benchmark for LLMs' trustworthiness evaluation in finance domain.

4. 改进效果在不同散度度量和解码温度下一致

Conclusion: 该方法通过连接分布鲁棒优化与提示学习，为现实不确定性下的可靠提示对齐提供即插即用方案，显著提升跨领域迁移能力而不影响原分布表现。

Abstract: Large language models are highly sensitive to prompt wording. However,
popular automatic prompt search methods, including InstructZero, often degrade
under distribution shift and adversarial evaluation because they optimize
expected performance under a single evaluation distribution. Consequently,
prompts that work in one setting frequently fail to transfer. To address this,
DRO-InstructZero formulates zero-shot prompt optimization as robust Bayesian
optimization. Specifically, an f-divergence ball defines an ambiguity set
around the evaluation distribution, and a robust acquisition rule maximizes
worst-case expected utility while retaining the query efficiency of Bayesian
search. Therefore, the search explicitly targets reliability under distribution
shift rather than average behavior alone. Experiments follow the
instruction-induction protocol with matched query budgets across formality
rewriting, code debugging, and translation. For example, on BIG-Bench
informative-to-formal rewriting, accuracy improves from 61.3 +/- 0.7% to
approximately 85-90%, yielding an absolute gain of about 25-30 points.
Moreover, auto-debugging shows about +25-point gains under domain shift.
Meanwhile, stable tasks such as cause-and-effect remain above 96%, indicating
no loss on in-distribution cases. Furthermore, improvements are consistent
across divergence choices and decoding temperatures. Overall, DRO-InstructZero
connects distributionally robust optimization with prompt learning, offering a
plug-and-play and general approach for reliable, transferable prompt alignment
under real-world uncertainty.
