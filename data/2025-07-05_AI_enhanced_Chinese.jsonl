We\nexamine the model's internal behavior on arithmetic tasks using a suite of\nprobing techniques including the Logit Lens and Coda Lens. Our findings reveal\nlimited evidence of interpretable latent CoT by tracking rank trajectories of\nfinal and intermediate result tokens. Furthermore, we uncover significant\nprobing inconsistencies across recurrent blocks, where the interpretability of\nhidden states depends heavily on both the layer index and the decoding method.\nFinally, we empirically show that increasing recurrence depth yields only\nmarginal gains and falls well short of models that explicitly externalize\nreasoning steps.

Creating such detailed face avatars from\nvideos is a challenging problem and has numerous applications in augmented and\nvirtual reality. While tremendous successes have been achieved for static\nfaces, animatable avatars from monocular videos still fall in the uncanny\nvalley. The de facto standard, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), represents a face\nthrough a collection of 3D Gaussian primitives. 3DGS excels at rendering static\nfaces, but the state-of-the-art still struggles with nonlinear deformations,\ncomplex lighting effects, and fine details. While most related works focus on\npredicting better Gaussian parameters from expression codes, we rethink the 3D\nGaussian representation itself and how to make it more expressive. Our insights\nlead to a novel extension of 3D Gaussians to high-dimensional multivariate\nGaussians, dubbed 'HyperGaussians'. The higher dimensionality increases\nexpressivity through conditioning on a learnable local embedding. However,\nsplatting HyperGaussians is computationally expensive because it requires\ninverting a high-dimensional covariance matrix. We solve this by\nreparameterizing the covariance matrix, dubbed the 'inverse covariance trick'.\nThis trick boosts the efficiency so that HyperGaussians can be seamlessly\nintegrated into existing models. To demonstrate this, we plug in HyperGaussians\ninto the state-of-the-art in fast monocular face avatars: FlashAvatar.

At its core, LiteReality first performs scene\nunderstanding and parses the results into a coherent 3D layout and objects with\nthe help of a structured scene graph. It then reconstructs the scene by\nretrieving the most visually similar 3D artist-crafted models from a curated\nasset database. Next, the Material Painting module enhances realism by\nrecovering high-quality, spatially varying materials. Finally, the\nreconstructed scene is integrated into a simulation engine with basic physical\nproperties to enable interactive behavior. The resulting scenes are compact,\neditable, and fully compatible with standard graphics pipelines, making them\nsuitable for applications in AR/VR, gaming, robotics, and digital twins. In\naddition, LiteReality introduces a training-free object retrieval module that\nachieves state-of-the-art similarity performance on the Scan2CAD benchmark,\nalong with a robust material painting module capable of transferring\nappearances from images of any style to 3D assets -- even under severe\nmisalignment, occlusion, and poor lighting.

In this\nwork, we introduce QFFN-BERT, a hybrid quantum-classical transformer where the\nfeedforward network (FFN) modules of a compact BERT variant are replaced by\nPQC-based layers. This design is motivated by the dominant parameter\ncontribution of FFNs, which account for approximately two-thirds of the\nparameters within standard Transformer encoder blocks. While prior studies have\nprimarily integrated PQCs into self-attention modules, our work focuses on the\nFFN and systematically investigates the trade-offs between PQC depth,\nexpressibility, and trainability. Our final PQC architecture incorporates a\nresidual connection, both $R_Y$ and $R_Z$ rotations, and an alternating\nentanglement strategy to ensure stable training and high expressibility. Our\nexperiments, conducted on a classical simulator, on the SST-2 and DBpedia\nbenchmarks demonstrate two key findings.

Importantly, qualitative analysis\nindicates that over-reasoning on simpler queries can lead to unnecessary delays\nand even decreased accuracy, a pitfall avoided by our adaptive routing.\nFinally, this work further introduces the Accuracy-Inference-Token (AIT) index\nto comprehensively evaluate the trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and token\ncost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7531\u6846\u67b6SynapseRoute\u667a\u80fd\u5206\u914d\u533b\u7597\u95ee\u9898\u81f3\u601d\u8003/\u975e\u601d\u8003\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u7387(0.8390)\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e36.8%\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u548c39.66%token\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u601d\u8003\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u975e\u601d\u8003\u6a21\u5f0f\u95f4\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b058%\u533b\u7597\u95ee\u9898\u65e0\u9700\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u5373\u53ef\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u667a\u80fd\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\u4f18\u5316\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684SynapseRoute\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7531\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7AIT\u6307\u6570\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cbe\u5ea6-\u5ef6\u8fdf-\u6210\u672c\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u76f8\u6bd4\u7eaf\u601d\u8003\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53471.18%\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u534736.8%\uff0ctoken\u6d88\u8017\u51cf\u5c1139.66%\uff0c\u4e14\u907f\u514d\u7b80\u5355\u95ee\u9898\u8fc7\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u95ee\u9898\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u4e8c\u5206\u6027\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7531\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861AI\u670d\u52a1\u6548\u80fd\u3002\u8fc7\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8def\u7531\u53ef\u89c4\u907f\u8be5\u7f3a\u9677\uff0cAIT\u6307\u6570\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u91cf\u5316\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

These shortcuts arise from a\nfundamental limitation of discriminative evaluation not shared by evaluations\nof the model's free-form, generative answers. Until recently, there appeared to\nbe no viable, scalable alternative to multiple choice--but, we show that this\nhas changed. We consider generative evaluation via what we call answer\nmatching: Give the candidate model the question without the options, have it\ngenerate a free-form response, then use a modern language model with the\nreference answer to determine if the response matches the reference. To compare\nthe validity of different evaluation strategies, we annotate MMLU-Pro and\nGPQA-Diamond to obtain human grading data, and measure the agreement of each\nevaluation approach.

In this work, we propose a novel chain-of-thought reasoning based\nevent stream scene text recognition framework, termed ESTR-CoT. Specifically,\nwe first adopt the vision encoder EVA-CLIP (ViT-G/14) to transform the input\nevent stream into tokens and utilize a Llama tokenizer to encode the given\ngeneration prompt. A Q-former is used to align the vision token to the\npre-trained large language model Vicuna-7B and output both the answer and\nchain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning process simultaneously. Our framework can be\noptimized using supervised fine-tuning in an end-to-end manner.

As a preliminary step toward GA design support, we define two\ntasks: 1) Intra-GA recommendation, which identifies figures within a given\npaper that are well-suited to serve as GAs, and 2) Inter-GA recommendation,\nwhich retrieves GAs from other papers to inspire the creation of new GAs. We\nprovide reasonable baseline models for these tasks. Furthermore, we propose\nConfidence Adjusted top-1 ground truth Ratio (CAR), a novel recommendation\nmetric that offers a fine-grained analysis of model behavior. CAR addresses\nlimitations in traditional ranking-based metrics by considering cases where\nmultiple figures within a paper, beyond the explicitly labeled GA, may also\nserve as GAs.

GRPO-style approaches implement\nthis by using self-generated samples labeled by an outcome-based verifier.\nHowever, these methods depend heavily on the model's initial ability to produce\npositive samples. They primarily refine what the model already knows\n(distribution sharpening) rather than enabling the model to solve problems\nwhere it initially fails. This limitation is especially problematic in\nearly-stage RL training and on challenging reasoning tasks, where positive\nsamples are unlikely to be generated. To unlock reasoning ability in such\nsettings, the model must explore new reasoning trajectories beyond its current\noutput distribution. Such exploration requires access to sufficiently good\npositive samples to guide the learning.
