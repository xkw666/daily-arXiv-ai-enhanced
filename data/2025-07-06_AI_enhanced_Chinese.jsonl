The de facto standard, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), represents a face\nthrough a collection of 3D Gaussian primitives. 3DGS excels at rendering static\nfaces, but the state-of-the-art still struggles with nonlinear deformations,\ncomplex lighting effects, and fine details. While most related works focus on\npredicting better Gaussian parameters from expression codes, we rethink the 3D\nGaussian representation itself and how to make it more expressive. Our insights\nlead to a novel extension of 3D Gaussians to high-dimensional multivariate\nGaussians, dubbed 'HyperGaussians'. The higher dimensionality increases\nexpressivity through conditioning on a learnable local embedding. However,\nsplatting HyperGaussians is computationally expensive because it requires\ninverting a high-dimensional covariance matrix. We solve this by\nreparameterizing the covariance matrix, dubbed the 'inverse covariance trick'.\nThis trick boosts the efficiency so that HyperGaussians can be seamlessly\nintegrated into existing models. To demonstrate this, we plug in HyperGaussians\ninto the state-of-the-art in fast monocular face avatars: FlashAvatar. Our\nevaluation on 19 subjects from 4 face datasets shows that HyperGaussians\noutperform 3DGS numerically and visually, particularly for high-frequency\ndetails like eyeglass frames, teeth, complex facial movements, and specular\nreflections.", "AI": {"tldr": "HyperGaussians\u6269\u5c553D\u9ad8\u65af\u629b\u96ea\u7403\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u7ef4\u591a\u5143\u9ad8\u65af\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u9006\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u6280\u5de7\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u9891\u9762\u90e8\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7ec6\u8282\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u67093DGS\u5728\u9762\u90e8\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u5f62\u3001\u590d\u6742\u5149\u7167\u548c\u7ec6\u8282\u5904\u7406\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u9ad8\u65af\u8868\u793a\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "1. \u5c063D\u9ad8\u65af\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u591a\u5143\u9ad8\u65af\uff08HyperGaussians\uff09\n2. \u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u5c40\u90e8\u5d4c\u5165\u589e\u5f3a\u8868\u8fbe\n3. \u63d0\u51fa\u9006\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u6280\u5de7\u4f18\u5316\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387", "result": "\u57284\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c619\u4e2a\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u4e2d\uff0c\u6570\u503c/\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e3DGS\uff0c\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\uff08\u773c\u955c\u6846\u3001\u7259\u9f7f\u3001\u9762\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u955c\u9762\u53cd\u5c04\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6269\u5c55+\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f18\u5316\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u9762\u90e8\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6050\u6016\u8c37\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4e3aAR/VR\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

At its core, LiteReality first performs scene\nunderstanding and parses the results into a coherent 3D layout and objects with\nthe help of a structured scene graph. It then reconstructs the scene by\nretrieving the most visually similar 3D artist-crafted models from a curated\nasset database. Next, the Material Painting module enhances realism by\nrecovering high-quality, spatially varying materials. Finally, the\nreconstructed scene is integrated into a simulation engine with basic physical\nproperties to enable interactive behavior. The resulting scenes are compact,\neditable, and fully compatible with standard graphics pipelines, making them\nsuitable for applications in AR/VR, gaming, robotics, and digital twins. In\naddition, LiteReality introduces a training-free object retrieval module that\nachieves state-of-the-art similarity performance on the Scan2CAD benchmark,\nalong with a robust material painting module capable of transferring\nappearances from images of any style to 3D assets -- even under severe\nmisalignment, occlusion, and poor lighting.

While label variation (LV), i.e., differing labels for the\nsame instance, is common, especially in natural language processing, annotation\nframeworks often still rest on the assumption of a single ground truth. This\noverlooks human label variation (HLV), the occurrence of plausible differences\nin annotations, as an informative signal. Similarly, active learning (AL), a\npopular approach to optimizing the use of limited annotation budgets in\ntraining ML models, often relies on at least one of several simplifying\nassumptions, which rarely hold in practice when acknowledging HLV. In this\npaper, we examine foundational assumptions about truth and label nature,\nhighlighting the need to decompose observed LV into signal (e.g., HLV) and\nnoise (e.g., annotation error).

Our evaluation\naddresses three key questions: (i) how the introduction of reasoning\ncapabilities affects model fairness and robustness; (ii) whether models\nfine-tuned for reasoning exhibit greater safety than those relying on CoT\nprompting at inference time; and (iii) how the success rate of jailbreak\nattacks targeting bias elicitation varies with the reasoning mechanisms\nemployed. Our findings reveal a nuanced relationship between reasoning\ncapabilities and bias safety. Surprisingly, models with explicit reasoning,\nwhether via CoT prompting or fine-tuned reasoning traces, are generally more\nvulnerable to bias elicitation than base models without such mechanisms,\nsuggesting reasoning may unintentionally open new pathways for stereotype\nreinforcement. Reasoning-enabled models appear somewhat safer than those\nrelying on CoT prompting, which are particularly prone to contextual reframing\nattacks through storytelling prompts, fictional personas, or reward-shaped\ninstructions.

Submitted to NeurIPS 2025", "summary": "The use of large language models (LLMs) in hiring promises to streamline\ncandidate screening, but it also raises serious concerns regarding accuracy and\nalgorithmic bias where sufficient safeguards are not in place. In this work, we\nbenchmark several state-of-the-art foundational LLMs - including models from\nOpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and Deepseek, and compare them with our\nproprietary domain-specific hiring model (Match Score) for job candidate\nmatching. We evaluate each model's predictive accuracy (ROC AUC,\nPrecision-Recall AUC, F1-score) and fairness (impact ratio of cut-off analysis\nacross declared gender, race, and intersectional subgroups). Our experiments on\na dataset of roughly 10,000 real-world recent candidate-job pairs show that\nMatch Score outperforms the general-purpose LLMs on accuracy (ROC AUC 0.85 vs\n0.77) and achieves significantly more equitable outcomes across demographic\ngroups. Notably, Match Score attains a minimum race-wise impact ratio of 0.957\n(near-parity), versus 0.809 or lower for the best LLMs, (0.906 vs 0.773 for the\nintersectionals, respectively). We discuss why pretraining biases may cause\nLLMs with insufficient safeguards to propagate societal biases in hiring\nscenarios, whereas a bespoke supervised model can more effectively mitigate\nthese biases. Our findings highlight the importance of domain-specific modeling\nand bias auditing when deploying AI in high-stakes domains such as hiring, and\ncaution against relying on off-the-shelf LLMs for such tasks without extensive\nfairness safeguards. Furthermore, we show with empirical evidence that there\nshouldn't be a dichotomy between choosing accuracy and fairness in hiring: a\nwell-designed algorithm can achieve both accuracy in hiring and fairness in\noutcomes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e13\u6709\u62db\u8058\u6a21\u578bMatch Score\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff08ROC AUC 0.85\uff09\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff08\u79cd\u65cf\u5f71\u54cd\u6bd40.957\uff09\u4e0a\u5168\u9762\u8d85\u8d8a\u901a\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e13\u4e1a\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u62db\u8058\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u516c\u5e73", "motivation": "\u63ed\u793a\u901a\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u62db\u8058\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u504f\u89c1\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u8bba\u8bc1\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u52bf", "method": "\u4f7f\u752810,000\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u5019\u9009\u4eba-\u804c\u4f4d\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u67905\u5bb6\u4e3b\u6d41LLM\u4e0e\u4e13\u7528\u62db\u8058\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff08ROC AUC/PR AUC/F1\uff09\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff08\u4eba\u53e3\u4e9a\u7fa4\u5f71\u54cd\u6bd4\uff09", "result": "\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578bROC AUC\u8fbe0.85\uff08LLMs\u6700\u9ad80.77\uff09\uff0c\u6700\u4f4e\u79cd\u65cf\u5f71\u54cd\u6bd40.957\uff08LLMs\u6700\u4f730.809\uff09\uff0c\u4ea4\u53c9\u4e9a\u7fa4\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u63d0\u534717.2%\uff080.906 vs 0.773\uff09", "conclusion": "\u4e13\u4e1a\u62db\u8058\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e94\u517c\u987e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u9886\u57df\u5b9a\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u504f\u5dee\u5ba1\u8ba1\u53ef\u7a81\u7834\u901a\u7528LLM\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57dfAI\u90e8\u7f72\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u4e13\u5c5e\u4fdd\u969c\u673a\u5236"}}

In this work, we propose a novel chain-of-thought reasoning based\nevent stream scene text recognition framework, termed ESTR-CoT. Specifically,\nwe first adopt the vision encoder EVA-CLIP (ViT-G/14) to transform the input\nevent stream into tokens and utilize a Llama tokenizer to encode the given\ngeneration prompt. A Q-former is used to align the vision token to the\npre-trained large language model Vicuna-7B and output both the answer and\nchain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning process simultaneously.

While recent research has increasingly\nincorporated visual materials such as Figure 1 as de facto GAs, their potential\nto enhance scientific communication remains largely unexplored. Moreover,\ndesigning effective GAs requires advanced visualization skills, creating a\nbarrier to their widespread adoption. To tackle these challenges, we introduce\nSciGA-145k, a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 145,000 scientific\npapers and 1.14 million figures, explicitly designed for supporting GA\nselection and recommendation as well as facilitating research in automated GA\ngeneration. As a preliminary step toward GA design support, we define two\ntasks: 1) Intra-GA recommendation, which identifies figures within a given\npaper that are well-suited to serve as GAs, and 2) Inter-GA recommendation,\nwhich retrieves GAs from other papers to inspire the creation of new GAs. We\nprovide reasonable baseline models for these tasks. Furthermore, we propose\nConfidence Adjusted top-1 ground truth Ratio (CAR), a novel recommendation\nmetric that offers a fine-grained analysis of model behavior. CAR addresses\nlimitations in traditional ranking-based metrics by considering cases where\nmultiple figures within a paper, beyond the explicitly labeled GA, may also\nserve as GAs.

We present compelling supporting\nevidence. The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) has long served as a model for\nstudying decision-making. We conduct the first ever series of evolutionary IPD\ntournaments, pitting canonical strategies (e.g., Tit-for-Tat, Grim Trigger)\nagainst agents from the leading frontier AI companies OpenAI, Google, and\nAnthropic. By varying the termination probability in each tournament (the\n\"shadow of the future\"), we introduce complexity and chance, confounding\nmemorisation.\n  Our results show that LLMs are highly competitive, consistently surviving and\nsometimes even proliferating in these complex ecosystems.

To address these challenges, we propose StepHint, a novel RLVR\nalgorithm that utilizes multi-level stepwise hints to help models explore the\nsolution space more effectively. StepHint generates valid reasoning chains from\nstronger models and partitions these chains into reasoning steps using our\nproposed adaptive partitioning method. The initial few steps are used as hints,\nand simultaneously, multiple-level hints (each comprising a different number of\nsteps) are provided to the model. This approach directs the model's exploration\ntoward a promising solution subspace while preserving its flexibility for\nindependent exploration.

However, the security vulnerabilities exhibited by the visual\nmodality pose significant challenges to deploying such models in open-world\nenvironments. Recent studies have successfully induced harmful responses from\ntarget MLLMs by encoding harmful textual semantics directly into visual inputs.\nHowever, in these approaches, the visual modality primarily serves as a trigger\nfor unsafe behavior, often exhibiting semantic ambiguity and lacking grounding\nin realistic scenarios. In this work, we define a novel setting: visual-centric\njailbreak, where visual information serves as a necessary component in\nconstructing a complete and realistic jailbreak context. Building on this\nsetting, we propose the VisCo (Visual Contextual) Attack. VisCo fabricates\ncontextual dialogue using four distinct visual-focused strategies, dynamically\ngenerating auxiliary images when necessary to construct a visual-centric\njailbreak scenario. To maximize attack effectiveness, it incorporates automatic\ntoxicity obfuscation and semantic refinement to produce a final attack prompt\nthat reliably triggers harmful responses from the target black-box MLLMs.\nSpecifically, VisCo achieves a toxicity score of 4.78 and an Attack Success\nRate (ASR) of 85% on MM-SafetyBench against GPT-4o, significantly outperforming\nthe baseline, which performs a toxicity score of 2.48 and an ASR of 22.2%.
