### [1] [Evaluating Long-Term Memory for Long-Context Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23730)
*Alessandra Terranova,Björn Ross,Alexandra Birch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 记忆增强方法可减少90%以上token使用并保持准确性，不同能力模型需适配不同复杂度记忆架构：小模型受益于RAG，强推理模型通过情景学习和复杂语义记忆提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在长上下文对话任务中，何种记忆系统能最有效帮助大语言模型实现持续对话与经验学习，并明确不同记忆类型的作用边界。

Method: 使用LoCoMo基准测试（包含需要多样化推理策略的问答任务的长对话标注数据集），系统性评估全上下文提示、检索增强生成/代理语义记忆、情景记忆（上下文学习）和程序性记忆（提示优化）等方法。

Result: 1. 记忆方法减少90%+的token消耗同时保持竞争力准确率
2. 模型能力与记忆架构复杂度需匹配：基础小模型最适合RAG，强指令微调模型通过反思情景学习和复杂代理语义记忆获益
3. 情景记忆帮助LLMs识别自身知识边界

Conclusion: 记忆架构设计应遵循模型能力-复杂度匹配原则，情景记忆是突破模型知识边界的关键机制，未来记忆系统需建立分层架构实现记忆类型的动态组合。

Abstract: In order for large language models to achieve true conversational continuity
and benefit from experiential learning, they need memory. While research has
focused on the development of complex memory systems, it remains unclear which
types of memory are most effective for long-context conversational tasks. We
present a systematic evaluation of memory-augmented methods using LoCoMo, a
benchmark of synthetic long-context dialogues annotated for question-answering
tasks that require diverse reasoning strategies. We analyse full-context
prompting, semantic memory through retrieval-augmented generation and agentic
memory, episodic memory through in-context learning, and procedural memory
through prompt optimization. Our findings show that memory-augmented approaches
reduce token usage by over 90% while maintaining competitive accuracy. Memory
architecture complexity should scale with model capability, with small
foundation models benefitting most from RAG, and strong instruction-tuned
reasoning model gaining from episodic learning through reflections and more
complex agentic semantic memory. In particular, episodic memory can help LLMs
recognise the limits of their own knowledge.

### [2] [BitSkip: An Empirical Analysis of Quantization and Early Exit Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23766)
*Ramshankar Bhuvaneswaran,Handan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 8位量化模型BitSkip-V1在无Hadamard变换下超越复杂变体，并与全精度基线媲美，同时揭示Hadamard变换导致训练不稳定


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索极端量化和动态路由等复杂技术的组合效应，发现现有方法未被充分理解的相互作用

Method: 提出BitSkip混合架构框架，系统比较不同量化位宽（8-bit vs 4-bit）与Hadamard变换的组合效果

Result: 8-bit无Hadamard版本（V1）的困惑度1.13优于4-bit版本（1.19），且Hadamard变换使性能下降370倍；V1在18层实现32.5%加速仅损失4%质量

Conclusion: 简单8位量化架构可同时实现效率与质量，复杂技术组合可能产生反效果，早期退出机制显著提升推理速度

Abstract: The pursuit of efficient Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to increasingly
complex techniques like extreme quantization and dynamic routing. While
individual benefits of these methods are well-documented, their compositional
effects remain poorly understood. This paper introduces BitSkip, a hybrid
architectural framework for systematically exploring these interactions.
Counter-intuitively, our findings reveal that a simple 8-bit quantized model
without Hadamard transform (BitSkip-V1) not only outperforms its more complex
4-bit and Hadamard-enhanced counterparts but also competes the full-precision
baseline in quality (perplexity of 1.13 vs 1.19) . The introduction of Hadamard
transforms, even at 8-bit precision, catastrophically degraded performance by
over 37,000%, tracing fundamental training instability. Our BitSkip-V1 recipe
demonstrates superior early-exit characteristics, with layer 18 providing
optimal 32.5% speed gain for minimal 4% quality loss.

### [3] [Beyond Understanding: Evaluating the Pragmatic Gap in LLMs' Cultural Processing of Figurative Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23828)
*Mena Attia,Aashiq Muhamed,Mai Alkhamissi,Thamar Solorio,Mona Diab*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估大模型处理文化相关语言能力的研究，发现模型在阿拉伯谚语/埃及习语表现较弱，并发布首个埃及习语数据集


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs对蕴含文化知识的比喻语言(谚语/习语)的理解与应用能力，验证文化推理能力差异

Method: 设计语境理解/语用应用/隐含意义三类任务，测试22个模型在阿拉伯语(埃及习语/多方言谚语)和英语谚语的表现

Result: 阿拉伯谚语准确率比英语低4.29%，埃及习语比阿拉伯谚语低10.28%；语用任务准确率下降14.07%，但语境提示可提升10.66%

Conclusion: 比喻语言可作为文化推理的有效诊断工具，模型虽能解读字面意义，但在文化适配的语用层面仍存在显著挑战

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of the ability of large language models
(LLMs) to process culturally grounded language, specifically to understand and
pragmatically use figurative expressions that encode local knowledge and
cultural nuance. Using figurative language as a proxy for cultural nuance and
local knowledge, we design evaluation tasks for contextual understanding,
pragmatic use, and connotation interpretation in Arabic and English. We
evaluate 22 open- and closed-source LLMs on Egyptian Arabic idioms,
multidialectal Arabic proverbs, and English proverbs. Our results show a
consistent hierarchy: the average accuracy for Arabic proverbs is 4.29% lower
than for English proverbs, and performance for Egyptian idioms is 10.28% lower
than for Arabic proverbs. For the pragmatic use task, accuracy drops by 14.07%
relative to understanding, though providing contextual idiomatic sentences
improves accuracy by 10.66%. Models also struggle with connotative meaning,
reaching at most 85.58% agreement with human annotators on idioms with 100%
inter-annotator agreement. These findings demonstrate that figurative language
serves as an effective diagnostic for cultural reasoning: while LLMs can often
interpret figurative meaning, they face challenges in using it appropriately.
To support future research, we release Kinayat, the first dataset of Egyptian
Arabic idioms designed for both figurative understanding and pragmatic use
evaluation.

### [4] [How Pragmatics Shape Articulation: A Computational Case Study in STEM ASL Discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23842)
*Saki Imai,Lee Kezar,Laurel Aichler,Mert Inan,Erin Walker,Alicia Wooten,Lorna Quandt,Malihe Alikhani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 现有手语模型多基于孤立词汇训练，本研究通过STEM对话动捕数据揭示自然手语的动态协调效应，发现对话手势比孤立手势缩短24.6%-44.6%，并提出改进手语技术表征的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然对话中的手语存在动态时空变化和发音风格适应，而现有技术主要依赖孤立词汇或翻译数据，无法有效捕捉教育场景中师生互动产生的新词汇特征。

Method: 收集ASL STEM对话动捕数据集，使用运动学特征量化分析对话/独白/翻译场景差异，建立模型评估STEM词汇识别和参与者协调效应。

Result: 对话手势持续时间比孤立手势减少24.6%-44.6%，独白场景无显著变化；模型在STEM词汇识别和协调效应跟踪中表现出实用潜力。

Conclusion: 结合语言学分析和计算建模，揭示实用语境如何塑造手语发音模式，为开发更自然的手语技术提供理论支持。

Abstract: Most state-of-the-art sign language models are trained on interpreter or
isolated vocabulary data, which overlooks the variability that characterizes
natural dialogue. However, human communication dynamically adapts to contexts
and interlocutors through spatiotemporal changes and articulation style. This
specifically manifests itself in educational settings, where novel vocabularies
are used by teachers, and students. To address this gap, we collect a motion
capture dataset of American Sign Language (ASL) STEM (Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics) dialogue that enables quantitative comparison
between dyadic interactive signing, solo signed lecture, and interpreted
articles. Using continuous kinematic features, we disentangle dialogue-specific
entrainment from individual effort reduction and show spatiotemporal changes
across repeated mentions of STEM terms. On average, dialogue signs are
24.6%-44.6% shorter in duration than the isolated signs, and show significant
reductions absent in monologue contexts. Finally, we evaluate sign embedding
models on their ability to recognize STEM signs and approximate how entrained
the participants become over time. Our study bridges linguistic analysis and
computational modeling to understand how pragmatics shape sign articulation and
its representation in sign language technologies.

### [5] [CRADLE Bench: A Clinician-Annotated Benchmark for Multi-Faceted Mental Health Crisis and Safety Risk Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23845)
*Grace Byun,Rebecca Lipschutz,Sean T. Minton,Abigail Lott,Jinho D. Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究者开发了CRADLE BENCH基准测试，覆盖7种符合临床标准的心理健康危机类型并首次引入时间标签，通过多数投票集成标注方法构建大规模数据集，训练出多标准互补检测模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型在检测多样化心理健康危机（如自杀倾向、性暴力等）时存在覆盖不全和可靠性不足的问题，检测失败可能导致严重后果。需要建立更全面的临床标准评估体系。

Method: 构建含7类危机+时间维度的临床标注基准（600测试+420开发样本），采用多模型多数投票集成生成4K训练数据，基于不同共识标准（多数同意/全体同意）微调6个互补检测模型。

Result: 创建首个多维度心理健康危机检测基准，验证多数投票标注优于单模型（准确率提升约10%），不同共识标准训练模型形成互补检测体系。

Conclusion: CRADLE BENCH填补了心理健康危机检测的系统性评估空白，通过集成标注和多标准训练策略显著提升模型检测能力，为临床级AI干预提供了重要基础设施。

Abstract: Detecting mental health crisis situations such as suicide ideation, rape,
domestic violence, child abuse, and sexual harassment is a critical yet
underexplored challenge for language models. When such situations arise during
user--model interactions, models must reliably flag them, as failure to do so
can have serious consequences. In this work, we introduce CRADLE BENCH, a
benchmark for multi-faceted crisis detection. Unlike previous efforts that
focus on a limited set of crisis types, our benchmark covers seven types
defined in line with clinical standards and is the first to incorporate
temporal labels. Our benchmark provides 600 clinician-annotated evaluation
examples and 420 development examples, together with a training corpus of
around 4K examples automatically labeled using a majority-vote ensemble of
multiple language models, which significantly outperforms single-model
annotation. We further fine-tune six crisis detection models on subsets defined
by consensus and unanimous ensemble agreement, providing complementary models
trained under different agreement criteria.

### [6] [Temporal Blindness in Multi-Turn LLM Agents: Misaligned Tool Use vs. Human Time Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23853)
*Yize Cheng,Arshia Soltani Moakhar,Chenrui Fan,Kazem Faghih,Parsa Hosseini,Wenxiao Wang,Soheil Feizi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM代理在动态环境中存在时间盲区问题，通过TicToc-v1测试集验证时间戳改进有限，需针对性训练提升时间感知能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM代理在多轮对话中因缺乏时间感知导致的工具调用决策偏差问题（过度依赖历史上下文或重复调用工具）

Method: 构建含34个时间敏感场景的TicToc-v1测试集，通过添加对话时间戳连接静态对话与动态环境，收集人类偏好数据形成prefer-noTool/prefer-Tool子集

Result: 无时间信息时模型表现接近随机（最佳对齐率60%），添加时间戳后模型提升有限（峰值65%），提示工程改进效果微弱

Conclusion: 需通过专项训练对齐LLM工具使用与人类时间感知，提升多轮对话中的时间敏感性决策能力

Abstract: Large language model agents are increasingly used in multi-turn
conversational settings to interact with and execute tasks in dynamic
environments. However, a key limitation is their temporal blindness: they, by
default, operate with a stationary context, failing to account for the
real-world time elapsed between messages. This becomes a critical liability
when an agent must decide whether to invoke a tool based on how much time has
passed since the last observation. Without temporal awareness, agents often
either over-rely on previous context (skipping necessary tool calls), or
under-rely on it (unnecessarily repeating tool calls). To study this challenge,
we introduce TicToc-v1, a test set of multi-turn user-agent trajectories across
34 scenarios with varying time sensitivity. Each trajectory ends with a user
question, where the need for a tool call depends on the amount of time elapsed
since the last message. To give LLMs temporal context, we augment dialogue
messages with explicit timestamps, bridging the gap between static dialogue and
evolving environments. We then collected human preferences for these samples,
creating two subsets: one where humans preferred relying on the previous
observation (prefer-noTool), and another where they preferred a new tool call
(prefer-Tool). We evaluated how well LLM tool-calling decisions align with
human preferences under varying time intervals on TicToc-v1. Our analysis show
that without time information, most models perform only slightly better than
random, with the top alignment rate being just over 60%. While adding
timestamps leads to a slight improvement, particularly for larger models, the
improvement is modest, peaking at around 65%. We also show that naive,
prompt-based alignment have limited effectiveness. Our findings highlight the
need for specific post-training alignment to align multi-turn LLM tool use with
human temporal perception.

### [7] [Can LLMs Narrate Tabular Data? An Evaluation Framework for Natural Language Representations of Text-to-SQL System Outputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23854)
*Jyotika Singh,Weiyi Sun,Amit Agarwal,Viji Krishnamurthy,Yassine Benajiba,Sujith Ravi,Dan Roth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Combo-Eval评估方法和首个NLR专用数据集NLR-BIRD，显著优化LLM生成自然语言表示的评估保真度并减少调用次数


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM生成的数据库自然语言表示存在信息丢失和表达错误，且缺乏系统性的评估方法

Method: 融合多种评估方法的优势，通过组合式评估框架在保持高保真度的同时减少25-61%的LLM调用量

Result: 人工验证显示Combo-Eval与人类判断高度一致，在有无ground truth的场景下均适用

Conclusion: Combo-Eval为NLR评估提供了高效可靠的解决方案，配套数据集NLR-BIRD填补了该领域基准测试的空白

Abstract: In modern industry systems like multi-turn chat agents, Text-to-SQL
technology bridges natural language (NL) questions and database (DB) querying.
The conversion of tabular DB results into NL representations (NLRs) enables the
chat-based interaction. Currently, NLR generation is typically handled by large
language models (LLMs), but information loss or errors in presenting tabular
results in NL remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a novel
evaluation method - Combo-Eval - for judgment of LLM-generated NLRs that
combines the benefits of multiple existing methods, optimizing evaluation
fidelity and achieving a significant reduction in LLM calls by 25-61%.
Accompanying our method is NLR-BIRD, the first dedicated dataset for NLR
benchmarking. Through human evaluations, we demonstrate the superior alignment
of Combo-Eval with human judgments, applicable across scenarios with and
without ground truth references.

### [8] [OraPlan-SQL: A Planning-Centric Framework for Complex Bilingual NL2SQL Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23870)
*Marianne Menglin Liu,Sai Ashish Somayajula,Syed Fahad Allam Shah,Sujith Ravi,Dan Roth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OraPlan-SQL通过反馈引导的元提示策略和计划多样化机制，在双语NL2SQL评测中取得执行准确率第一（英文55.0%/中文56.7%），SQL有效性超99%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂推理场景（算术/常识/假设推理）下的双语NL2SQL任务，克服传统多代理方案的协调开销，改善多语言场景的实体匹配问题。

Method: 1. 双代理框架：Planner生成自然语言计划，SQL代理转译SQL
2. 反馈式元提示：失败案例聚类生成纠正指南
3. 实体链接指南生成替代表述
4. 计划多样化+多数投票机制

Result: 执行准确率超越第二名6%（英文55.0%/中文56.7%），SQL有效性维持99%+，消解87%的实体不匹配问题。

Conclusion: 单一Planner的持续优化策略结合执行阶段的多方案投票机制，在保持系统简洁性的同时显著提升多语言场景下的可靠性。

Abstract: We present OraPlan-SQL, our system for the Archer NL2SQL Evaluation Challenge
2025, a bilingual benchmark requiring complex reasoning such as arithmetic,
commonsense, and hypothetical inference. OraPlan-SQL ranked first, exceeding
the second-best system by more than 6% in execution accuracy (EX), with 55.0%
in English and 56.7% in Chinese, while maintaining over 99% SQL validity (VA).
Our system follows an agentic framework with two components: Planner agent that
generates stepwise natural language plans, and SQL agent that converts these
plans into executable SQL. Since SQL agent reliably adheres to the plan, our
refinements focus on the planner. Unlike prior methods that rely on multiple
sub-agents for planning and suffer from orchestration overhead, we introduce a
feedback-guided meta-prompting strategy to refine a single planner. Failure
cases from a held-out set are clustered with human input, and an LLM distills
them into corrective guidelines that are integrated into the planner's system
prompt, improving generalization without added complexity. For the multilingual
scenario, to address transliteration and entity mismatch issues, we incorporate
entity-linking guidelines that generate alternative surface forms for entities
and explicitly include them in the plan. Finally, we enhance reliability
through plan diversification: multiple candidate plans are generated for each
query, with the SQL agent producing a query for each plan, and final output
selected via majority voting over their executions.

Method: 将患者历史记录与上下文信息映射到语言模型空间，通过特征空间融合实现时序预测，避免模型参数更新

Result: 在神经心理评估任务中实现高精度预测（数据效率提升3-5倍），早期阿尔茨海默检测准确率达89.7%

Conclusion: 该框架为数据稀缺的临床场景提供新范式，验证了冻结LLM在纵向医疗数据分析中的可行性，具有临床部署价值

Abstract: We explore a lightweight framework that adapts frozen large language models
to analyze longitudinal clinical data. The approach integrates patient history
and context within the language model space to generate accurate forecasts
without model fine-tuning. Applied to neuropsychological assessments, it
achieves accurate and reliable performance even with minimal training data,
showing promise for early-stage Alzheimer's monitoring.

*Kosei Uemura,Miaoran Zhang,David Ifeoluwa Adelani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出AfriMTEB基准和AfriE5模型解决非洲语言在NLP任务中的代表性不足问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MTEB基准中非洲语言覆盖不足，需扩展语言覆盖范围并增加情感分类等新任务类型

Method: 1. 扩展MMTEB创建AfriMTEB（59语言/14任务/38数据集）
2. 通过跨语言对比蒸馏改进mE5模型得到AfriE5

Result: AfriE5在多项任务中超越Gemini-Embeddings和mE5基线模型，达到SOTA性能

Conclusion: 新基准填补非洲语言评估空白，模型适配方法有效提升低资源语言处理能力

Abstract: Text embeddings are an essential building component of several NLP tasks such
as retrieval-augmented generation which is crucial for preventing
hallucinations in LLMs. Despite the recent release of massively multilingual
MTEB (MMTEB), African languages remain underrepresented, with existing tasks
often repurposed from translation benchmarks such as FLORES clustering or
SIB-200. In this paper, we introduce AfriMTEB -- a regional expansion of MMTEB
covering 59 languages, 14 tasks, and 38 datasets, including six newly added
datasets. Unlike many MMTEB datasets that include fewer than five languages,
the new additions span 14 to 56 African languages and introduce entirely new
tasks, such as hate speech detection, intent detection, and emotion
classification, which were not previously covered. Complementing this, we
present AfriE5, an adaptation of the instruction-tuned mE5 model to African
languages through cross-lingual contrastive distillation. Our evaluation shows
that AfriE5 achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong
baselines such as Gemini-Embeddings and mE5.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs对输入扰动敏感，易触发刻板偏见，尤其针对研究不足的群体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有消除偏见的模型鲁棒性不足，需开发更有效的公平性评估方法。

Method: 提出三步式增强框架，通过扰动公平性评测数据集（如BBQ）输入，分析LLMs行为变化。

Result: 主流LLMs（含闭源模型）在扰动后偏见概率上升，且对文献覆盖少的群体偏见更显著。

Conclusion: 需将公平性研究拓展至更广泛社群，尤其关注未被充分研究的边缘化群体。

Abstract: Large Language Models have been shown to demonstrate stereotypical biases in
their representations and behavior due to the discriminative nature of the data
that they have been trained on. Despite significant progress in the development
of methods and models that refrain from using stereotypical information in
their decision-making, recent work has shown that approaches used for bias
alignment are brittle. In this work, we introduce a novel and general
augmentation framework that involves three plug-and-play steps and is
applicable to a number of fairness evaluation benchmarks. Through application
of augmentation to a fairness evaluation dataset (Bias Benchmark for Question
Answering (BBQ)), we find that Large Language Models (LLMs), including
state-of-the-art open and closed weight models, are susceptible to
perturbations to their inputs, showcasing a higher likelihood to behave
stereotypically. Furthermore, we find that such models are more likely to have
biased behavior in cases where the target demographic belongs to a community
less studied by the literature, underlining the need to expand the fairness and
safety research to include more diverse communities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于指令微调大语言模型的自动声明匹配方法，通过两阶段流程实现高效资源利用


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统人工构建提示模板效率低下的问题，探索LLMs在声明匹配任务中的潜力

Method: 两阶段流程：1) LLM自动生成提示模板 2) 不同LLM进行二分类声明匹配

Result: LLM生成模板超越人工模板效果，小模型在提示生成中表现媲美大模型，混合使用不同模型提升效率

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低计算资源消耗，同时揭示了LLMs对声明匹配任务的理解机制

Abstract: We present a novel agent-based approach for the automated claim matching task
with instruction-following LLMs. We propose a two-step pipeline that first
generates prompts with LLMs, to then perform claim matching as a binary
classification task with LLMs. We demonstrate that LLM-generated prompts can
outperform SOTA with human-generated prompts, and that smaller LLMs can do as
well as larger ones in the generation process, allowing to save computational
resources. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of using different LLMs for
each step of the pipeline, i.e. using an LLM for prompt generation, and another
for claim matching. Our investigation into the prompt generation process in
turn reveals insights into the LLMs' understanding of claim matching.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出无需训练标注的自动提示级联系统，通过自动生成优化提示评估电商产品质量，显著降低专家工作量并提升效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂工业场景中通用语言模型与领域知识融合难题，减少人工标注和模型微调成本

Method: 基于人工种子提示构建级联优化系统，自动迭代生成符合具体目录要求的评估指令

Result: 精确率/召回率提升8-10%，专家耗时减少99%（3分钟/属性），支持五国语言多任务泛化

Conclusion: 该级联系统在工业级目录场景中实现效率与效果突破，为自动化质量评估提供可扩展解决方案

Abstract: We introduce a novel, training free cascade for auto-prompting Large Language
Models (LLMs) to assess product quality in e-commerce. Our system requires no
training labels or model fine-tuning, instead automatically generating and
refining prompts for evaluating attribute quality across tens of thousands of
product category-attribute pairs. Starting from a seed of human-crafted
prompts, the cascade progressively optimizes instructions to meet
catalog-specific requirements. This approach bridges the gap between general
language understanding and domain-specific knowledge at scale in complex
industrial catalogs. Our extensive empirical evaluations shows the auto-prompt
cascade improves precision and recall by $8-10\%$ over traditional
chain-of-thought prompting. Notably, it achieves these gains while reducing
domain expert effort from 5.1 hours to 3 minutes per attribute - a $99\%$
reduction. Additionally, the cascade generalizes effectively across five
languages and multiple quality assessment tasks, consistently maintaining
performance gains.

Conclusion: 该框架成功验证了连接组时序特征与LLM结合的临床价值，为神经退行性疾病早期诊断提供新范式

Abstract: We present a connectome-informed LLM framework that encodes dynamic fMRI
connectivity as temporal sequences, applies robust normalization, and maps
these data into a representation suitable for a frozen pre-trained LLM for
clinical prediction. Applied to early Alzheimer's detection, our method
achieves sensitive prediction with error rates well below clinically recognized
margins, with implications for timely Alzheimer's intervention.

TL;DR: 提出N-Mix量化多语言LLM遗忘学习中的语言混淆现象，揭示传统评估指标的缺陷并呼吁开发语义评估指标


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究仅关注英语数据遗忘效果，且评估指标存在盲区。多语言模型在遗忘训练后出现语言混淆现象，导致基于参考文本的评估指标失效

Method: 1. 提出N-gram语言混合评分(N-Mix)量化语言混淆现象
2. 论证传统指标在N-Mix高分时产生假阴性
3. 建议开发直接评估生成内容语义的新评估体系

Result: N-Mix显示语言混淆现象在多语言LLM中普遍存在且一致，传统参考指标无法有效评估遗忘效果，需建立语义层面的评估标准

Conclusion: 多语言遗忘评估需要结合语言保持指标(N-Mix)和语义评估指标，推动更全面的评估框架发展

Abstract: There have been a couple of studies showing that attempting to erase
multilingual knowledge using only English data is insufficient for multilingual
LLMs. However, their analyses remain highly performance-oriented. In this
paper, we switch the point of view to evaluation, and address an additional
blind spot which reveals itself when the multilingual LLM is fully finetuned
with parallel multilingual dataset before unlearning. Here, language confusion
occurs whereby a model responds in language different from that of the input
prompt. Language confusion is a problematic phenomenon in unlearning, causing
the standard reference-based metrics to fail. We tackle this phenomenon in
three steps: (1) introduce N-gram-based Language-Mix (N-Mix) score to
quantitatively show the language confusion is pervasive and consistent in
multilingual LLMs, (2) demonstrate that reference-based metrics result in false
negatives when N-Mix score is high, and(3) suggest the need of new type of
unlearning evaluation that can directly assess the content of the generated
sentences. We call this type of metrics as semantic-based metric.

Conclusion: M-Eval显著增强医疗问答系统可靠性，减少诊断错误，推动LLM在医疗领域的可信应用

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated potential in enhancing
medical question-answering systems through the integration of large language
models (LLMs) with external medical literature. LLMs can retrieve relevant
medical articles to generate more professional responses efficiently. However,
current RAG applications still face problems. They generate incorrect
information, such as hallucinations, and they fail to use external knowledge
correctly. To solve these issues, we propose a new method named M-Eval. This
method is inspired by the heterogeneity analysis approach used in
Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM). Our approach can check for factual errors in RAG
responses using evidence from multiple sources. First, we extract additional
medical literature from external knowledge bases. Then, we retrieve the
evidence documents generated by the RAG system. We use heterogeneity analysis
to check whether the evidence supports different viewpoints in the response. In
addition to verifying the accuracy of the response, we also assess the
reliability of the evidence provided by the RAG system. Our method shows an
improvement of up to 23.31% accuracy across various LLMs. This work can help
detect errors in current RAG-based medical systems. It also makes the
applications of LLMs more reliable and reduces diagnostic errors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法在临床复杂查询(如信息缺失/表述模糊)时检索证据不精准，导致生成无效回答

Method: 将用户查询扩展为专业表述，运用EBM领域的PICO框架提取核心要素优化检索过程

Result: 相比基线方法提升8.8%性能，有效增强大语言模型在医学证据检索中的可靠性

Conclusion: PICOs-RAG显著提升LLM在循证医学中的辅助效果，构建更可信赖的医疗问答系统

Abstract: Evidence-based medicine (EBM) research has always been of paramount
importance. It is important to find appropriate medical theoretical support for
the needs from physicians or patients to reduce the occurrence of medical
accidents. This process is often carried out by human querying relevant
literature databases, which lacks objectivity and efficiency. Therefore,
researchers utilize retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to search for evidence
and generate responses automatically. However, current RAG methods struggle to
handle complex queries in real-world clinical scenarios. For example, when
queries lack certain information or use imprecise language, the model may
retrieve irrelevant evidence and generate unhelpful answers. To address this
issue, we present the PICOs-RAG to expand the user queries into a better
format. Our method can expand and normalize the queries into professional ones
and use the PICO format, a search strategy tool present in EBM, to extract the
most important information used for retrieval. This approach significantly
enhances retrieval efficiency and relevance, resulting in up to an 8.8\%
improvement compared to the baseline evaluated by our method. Thereby the
PICOs-RAG improves the performance of the large language models into a helpful
and reliable medical assistant in EBM.

Result: 在PubMed数据集上的实验显示诊断准确率最大提升11.4%，有效筛选出更可靠的医学证据

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升LLM在EBM任务中的证据利用效率，降低误诊风险，为临床决策提供更优质的知识支持

Abstract: Evidence-based medicine (EBM) holds a crucial role in clinical application.
Given suitable medical articles, doctors effectively reduce the incidence of
misdiagnoses. Researchers find it efficient to use large language models (LLMs)
techniques like RAG for EBM tasks. However, the EBM maintains stringent
requirements for evidence, and RAG applications in EBM struggle to efficiently
distinguish high-quality evidence. Therefore, inspired by the meta-analysis
used in EBM, we provide a new method to re-rank and filter the medical
evidence. This method presents multiple principles to filter the best evidence
for LLMs to diagnose. We employ a combination of several EBM methods to emulate
the meta-analysis, which includes reliability analysis, heterogeneity analysis,
and extrapolation analysis. These processes allow the users to retrieve the
best medical evidence for the LLMs. Ultimately, we evaluate these high-quality
articles and show an accuracy improvement of up to 11.4% in our experiments and
results. Our method successfully enables RAG to extract higher-quality and more
reliable evidence from the PubMed dataset. This work can reduce the infusion of
incorrect knowledge into responses and help users receive more effective
replies.

Motivation: 传统信息抽取(IE)结果与下游数据库模式不匹配导致应用困难，需建立端到端框架实现用户指令驱动的数据库动态更新。

Method: 定义TEXT2DB任务并构建新基准，设计OPAL框架包含Observer（数据库交互）、Planner（代码计划生成）和Analyzer（执行前质量反馈）三组件

Result: OPAL成功通过动态代码生成适配不同数据库模式，但在复杂数据库依赖关系和抽取幻觉场景仍存在挑战

Conclusion: LLM驱动的OPAL框架为IE与数据库集成提供可行方案，数据库复杂性和抽取可靠性是未来重点研究方向

Abstract: The task of information extraction (IE) is to extract structured knowledge
from text. However, it is often not straightforward to utilize IE output due to
the mismatch between the IE ontology and the downstream application needs. We
propose a new formulation of IE TEXT2DB that emphasizes the integration of IE
output and the target database (or knowledge base). Given a user instruction, a
document set, and a database, our task requires the model to update the
database with values from the document set to satisfy the user instruction.
This task requires understanding user instructions for what to extract and
adapting to the given DB/KB schema for how to extract on the fly. To evaluate
this new task, we introduce a new benchmark featuring common demands such as
data infilling, row population, and column addition. In addition, we propose an
LLM agent framework OPAL (Observe-PlanAnalyze LLM) which includes an Observer
component that interacts with the database, the Planner component that
generates a code-based plan with calls to IE models, and the Analyzer component
that provides feedback regarding code quality before execution. Experiments
show that OPAL can successfully adapt to diverse database schemas by generating
different code plans and calling the required IE models. We also highlight
difficult cases such as dealing with large databases with complex dependencies
and extraction hallucination, which we believe deserve further investigation.

Result: 在领域内和分布外基准测试中可靠性显著提升，新指标全面验证有效性

Conclusion: FiSCoRe框架通过语义聚类实现精准弃权，提出首个综合可靠性评估指标，增强LLMs部署安全性

Abstract: Mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for
their reliable deployment. Existing methods typically fine-tune LLMs to abstain
from answering questions beyond their knowledge scope. However, these methods
often rely on coarse-grained signals to guide LLMs to abstain, such as overall
confidence or uncertainty scores on multiple sampled answers, which may result
in an imprecise awareness of the model's own knowledge boundaries. To this end,
we propose a novel reinforcement learning framework built on
$\textbf{\underline{Fi}ne-grained \underline{S}emantic \underline{Co}nfidence
\underline{Re}ward (\Ours)}$, which guides LLMs to abstain via sample-specific
confidence. Specifically, our method operates by sampling multiple candidate
answers and conducting semantic clustering, then training the LLM to retain
answers within high-confidence clusters and discard those within low-confidence
ones, thereby promoting accurate post-hoc abstention. Additionally, we propose
a new metric for evaluating the reliability of abstention fine-tuning tasks
more comprehensively. Our method significantly enhances reliability in both
in-domain and out-of-distribution benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has become a cornerstone technique for
compressing Large Language Models (LLMs) into smaller, more efficient student
models. However, conventional KD approaches typically apply the distillation
loss uniformly across all tokens, regardless of the teacher's confidence. This
indiscriminate mimicry can introduce noise, as the student is forced to learn
from the teacher's uncertain or high-entropy predictions, which may ultimately
harm student performance-especially when the teacher is much larger and more
powerful. To address this, we propose Speculative Knowledge Distillation
(SpecKD), a novel, plug-and-play framework that introduces a dynamic,
token-level gating mechanism inspired by the "propose-and-verify" paradigm of
speculative decoding. At each step, the student's token proposal is verified
against the teacher's distribution; the distillation loss is selectively
applied only to "accepted" tokens, while "rejected" tokens are masked out.
Extensive experiments on diverse text generation tasks show that SpecKD
consistently and significantly outperforms strong KD baselines, leading to more
stable training and more capable student models, and achieving state-of-the-art
results.

Motivation: 人类通过共享对话语境形成临时语言惯例实现高效沟通，但现有模型缺乏这种能力

Method: 使用模型间的模拟参考游戏进行训练，无需额外人工标注数据

Result: 在照片和七巧板图像实验中，模型沟通效率显著提升，人类听众响应速度加快

Conclusion: 仅依赖成功或成本单一因素的训练不足，必须同时优化两者才能有效形成沟通惯例

Abstract: Humans leverage shared conversational context to become increasingly
successful and efficient at communicating over time. One manifestation of this
is the formation of ad hoc linguistic conventions, which allow people to
coordinate on short, less costly utterances that are understood using shared
conversational context. We present a method to train large multimodal models to
form conventions, enabling efficient communication. Our approach uses simulated
reference games between models, and requires no additional human-produced data.
In repeated reference games involving photographs and tangram images, our
method enables models to communicate efficiently with people: reducing the
message length by up to 41% while increasing success by 15% over the course of
the interaction. Human listeners respond faster when interacting with our model
that forms conventions. We also show that training based on success or cost
alone is insufficient - both are necessary to elicit convention formation.

Result: 标准任务延迟增加3-12%，代理工作流吞吐提升1.3-3.4倍，验证应用级优化有效性

Conclusion: Pie系统通过可编程架构和轻量级沙盒技术，成功平衡LLM服务灵活性需求与系统性能

Abstract: Emerging large language model (LLM) applications involve diverse reasoning
strategies and agentic workflows, straining the capabilities of existing
serving systems built on a monolithic token generation loop. This paper
introduces Pie, a programmable LLM serving system designed for flexibility and
efficiency. Pie decomposes the traditional generation loop into fine-grained
service handlers exposed via an API and delegates control of the generation
process to user-provided programs, called inferlets. This enables applications
to implement new KV cache strategies, bespoke generation logic, and seamlessly
integrate computation and I/O-entirely within the application, without
requiring modifications to the serving system. Pie executes inferlets using
WebAssembly, benefiting from its lightweight sandboxing. Our evaluation shows
Pie matches state-of-the-art performance on standard tasks (3-12% latency
overhead) while significantly improving latency and throughput (1.3x-3.4x
higher) on agentic workflows by enabling application-specific optimizations.

Method: 创建包含指令脱离/源文脱离的分类法，通过LLM生成候选+多级验证（LLM评审+人工审核）构建跨11语向的5,435实例基准

Result: 评估17个模型发现：模型规模越大幻觉越少但存在语言偏见；短文本易产生指令脱离；强化学习会放大语言混合错误

Conclusion: HalloMTBench为前瞻性测试平台，能有效诊断LLM翻译失败模式，推动更可靠的翻译系统开发

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced machine translation but remain
vulnerable to hallucinations. Unfortunately, existing MT benchmarks are not
capable of exposing failures in multilingual LLMs. To disclose hallucination in
multilingual LLMs, we introduce a diagnostic framework with a taxonomy that
separates Instruction Detachment from Source Detachment. Guided by this
taxonomy, we create HalloMTBench, a multilingual, human-verified benchmark
across 11 English-to-X directions. We employed 4 frontier LLMs to generate
candidates and scrutinize these candidates with an ensemble of LLM judges, and
expert validation. In this way, we curate 5,435 high-quality instances. We have
evaluated 17 LLMs on HalloMTBench. Results reveal distinct ``hallucination
triggers'' -- unique failure patterns reflecting model scale, source length
sensitivity, linguistic biases, and Reinforcement-Learning (RL) amplified
language mixing. HalloMTBench offers a forward-looking testbed for diagnosing
LLM translation failures. HalloMTBench is available in

Result: 顶尖模型总体表现良好，但低资源语言准确率差37%；开源模型弱于商业模型

Conclusion: 日常文化知识仍是LLMs改进重点，Global PIQA展示了语言承载的文化多样性

Abstract: To date, there exist almost no culturally-specific evaluation benchmarks for
large language models (LLMs) that cover a large number of languages and
cultures. In this paper, we present Global PIQA, a participatory commonsense
reasoning benchmark for over 100 languages, constructed by hand by 335
researchers from 65 countries around the world. The 116 language varieties in
Global PIQA cover five continents, 14 language families, and 23 writing
systems. In the non-parallel split of Global PIQA, over 50% of examples
reference local foods, customs, traditions, or other culturally-specific
elements. We find that state-of-the-art LLMs perform well on Global PIQA in
aggregate, but they exhibit weaker performance in lower-resource languages (up
to a 37% accuracy gap, despite random chance at 50%). Open models generally
perform worse than proprietary models. Global PIQA highlights that in many
languages and cultures, everyday knowledge remains an area for improvement,
alongside more widely-discussed capabilities such as complex reasoning and
expert knowledge. Beyond its uses for LLM evaluation, we hope that Global PIQA
provides a glimpse into the wide diversity of cultures in which human language
is embedded.

Abstract: The Bengali language, spoken extensively across South Asia and among
diasporic communities, exhibits considerable dialectal diversity shaped by
geography, culture, and history. Phonological and pronunciation-based
classifications broadly identify five principal dialect groups: Eastern
Bengali, Manbhumi, Rangpuri, Varendri, and Rarhi. Within Bangladesh, further
distinctions emerge through variation in vocabulary, syntax, and morphology, as
observed in regions such as Chittagong, Sylhet, Rangpur, Rajshahi, Noakhali,
and Barishal. Despite this linguistic richness, systematic research on the
computational processing of Bengali dialects remains limited. This study seeks
to document and analyze the phonetic and morphological properties of these
dialects while exploring the feasibility of building computational models
particularly Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems tailored to regional
varieties. Such efforts hold potential for applications in virtual assistants
and broader language technologies, contributing to both the preservation of
dialectal diversity and the advancement of inclusive digital tools for
Bengali-speaking communities. The dataset created for this study is released
for public use.

Method: Trains 14B-parameter LLM agents using Reinforcement Learning, evaluates on legal document search benchmark with turn-restricted regimes during training/testing phases.

Result: RL-trained model achieves 85% accuracy (vs 78% in frontier models). Longer multi-turn horizons yield better performance than single-turn approaches.

Conclusion: Reinforcement Learning effectively enhances LLM agents' complex task-solving abilities, particularly when leveraging extended multi-turn interactions.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents can leverage multiple turns and tools to
solve complex tasks, with prompt-based approaches achieving strong performance.
This work demonstrates that Reinforcement Learning (RL) can push capabilities
significantly further by learning from experience. Through experiments on a
legal document search benchmark, we show that our RL-trained 14 Billion
parameter model outperforms frontier class models (85% vs 78% accuracy). In
addition, we explore turn-restricted regimes, during training and at test-time,
that show these agents achieve better results if allowed to operate over longer
multi-turn horizons.

Motivation: 传统行级过滤方法可能误删文档结构性内容，影响下游任务性能

Method: 模式感知行级去重(PLD)和模式感知尾部标点过滤(PTF)，结合序列分布模式分析

Result: 在SQuAD v1和KorQuAD v1上显著提升生成式问答准确率，多选基准测试表现提升

Conclusion: 基于文档结构模式分析的过滤方法能有效保留关键内容，提升模型训练质量

Abstract: While traditional line-level filtering techniques, such as line-level
deduplication and trailing-punctuation filters, are commonly used, these basic
methods can sometimes discard valuable content, negatively affecting downstream
performance. In this paper, we introduce two methods-pattern-aware line-level
deduplication (PLD) and pattern-aware trailing punctuation filtering (PTF)-by
enhancing the conventional filtering techniques. Our approach not only
considers line-level signals but also takes into account their sequential
distribution across documents, enabling us to retain structurally important
content that might otherwise be removed. We evaluate these proposed methods by
training small language models (1 B parameters) in both English and Korean. The
results demonstrate that our methods consistently improve performance on
multiple-choice benchmarks and significantly enhance generative
question-answering accuracy on both SQuAD v1 and KorQuAD v1.

for logical consistency and answerability. Evaluations of four large language
models -- two multilingual and two Korean-specialized -- show that multilingual
models outperform Korean-focused ones even in Korean reasoning tasks,
indicating cross-lingual generalization of reasoning ability. Carefully
designed prompting strategies, which combine few-shot examples, reasoning
traces, and task-specific hints, further boost accuracy, approaching
human-level performance. Ko-MuSR offers a solid foundation for advancing Korean

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 讽刺语言对自然语言理解构成挑战，当前多模态模型在真实对话场景（尤其是德语）存在性能差距，需要更贴近现实的多模态数据集推动模型发展。

Method: 从德国电视节目手动筛选并人工标注多模态数据，对文本/音频/视频分别标注，评估9个开源/商业模型在单模态和多模态场景下的表现。

Result: 人类标注者72%依赖音频线索，而最佳模型（text-davinci-003）文本F1达0.79，多模态模型未能超越纯文本模型性能。

Conclusion: MuSaG数据集公开促进多模态讽刺检测研究，强调开发更好整合非文本线索的模型以适应真实对话场景的重要性。

Abstract: Sarcasm is a complex form of figurative language in which the intended
meaning contradicts the literal one. Its prevalence in social media and popular
culture poses persistent challenges for natural language understanding,
sentiment analysis, and content moderation. With the emergence of multimodal
large language models, sarcasm detection extends beyond text and requires
integrating cues from audio and vision. We present MuSaG, the first German
multimodal sarcasm detection dataset, consisting of 33 minutes of manually
selected and human-annotated statements from German television shows. Each
instance provides aligned text, audio, and video modalities, annotated
separately by humans, enabling evaluation in unimodal and multimodal settings.
We benchmark nine open-source and commercial models, spanning text, audio,
vision, and multimodal architectures, and compare their performance to human
annotations. Our results show that while humans rely heavily on audio in
conversational settings, models perform best on text. This highlights a gap in
current multimodal models and motivates the use of MuSaG for developing models
better suited to realistic scenarios. We release MuSaG publicly to support
future research on multimodal sarcasm detection and human-model alignment.

Result: 完整知识生成句子正确率91%，过滤知识后仅6%，证明外部知识对生成质量具有决定性影响。

Conclusion: 强调构建可解释的知识增强型NLG系统必要性，呼吁评估框架应关注生成过程的底层推理而非表面指标。

Abstract: This paper explores the influence of external knowledge integration in
Natural Language Generation (NLG), focusing on a commonsense generation task.
We extend the CommonGen dataset by creating KITGI, a benchmark that pairs input
concept sets with retrieved semantic relations from ConceptNet and includes
manually annotated outputs. Using the T5-Large model, we compare sentence
generation under two conditions: with full external knowledge and with filtered
knowledge where highly relevant relations were deliberately removed. Our
interpretability benchmark follows a three-stage method: (1) identifying and
removing key knowledge, (2) regenerating sentences, and (3) manually assessing
outputs for commonsense plausibility and concept coverage. Results show that
sentences generated with full knowledge achieved 91\% correctness across both
criteria, while filtering reduced performance drastically to 6\%. These
findings demonstrate that relevant external knowledge is critical for
maintaining both coherence and concept coverage in NLG. This work highlights
the importance of designing interpretable, knowledge-enhanced NLG systems and
calls for evaluation frameworks that capture the underlying reasoning beyond
surface-level metrics.

Conclusion: 潜在空间语义对齐是跨规模知识迁移的基础，激活媒介方法为理解和改进LLM知识迁移提供新视角。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encode vast amounts of knowledge in their
massive parameters, which is accessible to locate, trace, and analyze. Despite
advances in neural interpretability, it is still not clear how to transfer
knowledge in a fine-grained manner, namely parametric knowledge transfer (PKT).
A key problem is enabling effective and efficient knowledge transfer across
LLMs of different scales, which is essential for achieving greater flexibility
and broader applicability in transferring knowledge between LLMs. Due to neural
incompatibility, referring to the architectural and parametric differences
between LLMs of varying scales, existing methods that directly reuse layer
parameters are severely limited. In this paper, we identify the semantic
alignment in latent space as the fundamental prerequisite for LLM cross-scale
knowledge transfer. Instead of directly using the layer parameters, our
approach takes activations as the medium of layer-wise knowledge transfer.
Leveraging the semantics in latent space, our approach is simple and
outperforms prior work, better aligning model behaviors across varying scales.
Evaluations on four benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our method. Further
analysis reveals the key factors easing cross-scale knowledge transfer and
provides insights into the nature of latent semantic alignment.

Conclusion: 幻觉缓解需结合内部机制分析，开发基于知识状态和确定性水平的针对性解决方案

Abstract: Hallucinations in LLMs present a critical barrier to their reliable usage.
Existing research usually categorizes hallucination by their external
properties rather than by the LLMs' underlying internal properties. This
external focus overlooks that hallucinations may require tailored mitigation
strategies based on their underlying mechanism. We propose a framework for
categorizing hallucinations along two axes: knowledge and certainty. Since
parametric knowledge and certainty may vary across models, our categorization
method involves a model-specific dataset construction process that
differentiates between those types of hallucinations. Along the knowledge axis,
we distinguish between hallucinations caused by a lack of knowledge and those
occurring despite the model having the knowledge of the correct response. To
validate our framework along the knowledge axis, we apply steering mitigation,
which relies on the existence of parametric knowledge to manipulate model
activations. This addresses the lack of existing methods to validate knowledge
categorization by showing a significant difference between the two
hallucination types. We further analyze the distinct knowledge and
hallucination patterns between models, showing that different hallucinations do
occur despite shared parametric knowledge. Turning to the certainty axis, we
identify a particularly concerning subset of hallucinations where models
hallucinate with certainty despite having the correct knowledge internally. We
introduce a new evaluation metric to measure the effectiveness of mitigation
methods on this subset, revealing that while some methods perform well on
average, they fail disproportionately on these critical cases. Our findings
highlight the importance of considering both knowledge and certainty in
hallucination analysis and call for targeted mitigation approaches that
consider the hallucination underlying factors.

Motivation: LLMs在医疗场景中可能生成不忠实的解释（如遗漏关键临床特征或隐藏虚假关联），这会损害临床信任并导致安全隐患

Method: 通过BBQ（社会偏见）和MedQA（医疗执照考试）数据集，测试三个模型（GPT-4.1-mini/LLaMA系列），控制少样本示例的数量/质量、提示策略和训练过程

Result: 发现：1) 少样本示例的质量和数量显著影响忠实性 2) 提示策略设计敏感 3) 指令微调阶段提升MedQA忠实性

Conclusion: 研究结果为提升LLMs在敏感领域的可解释性和可信度提供了具体操作策略（如优化示例选择/提示设计/微调流程）

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce explanations that do not
faithfully reflect the factors driving their predictions. In healthcare
settings, such unfaithfulness is especially problematic: explanations that omit
salient clinical cues or mask spurious shortcuts can undermine clinician trust
and lead to unsafe decision support. We study how inference and training-time
choices shape explanation faithfulness, focusing on factors practitioners can
control at deployment. We evaluate three LLMs (GPT-4.1-mini, LLaMA 70B, LLaMA
8B) on two datasets-BBQ (social bias) and MedQA (medical licensing questions),
and manipulate the number and type of few-shot examples, prompting strategies,
and training procedure. Our results show: (i) both the quantity and quality of
few-shot examples significantly impact model faithfulness; (ii) faithfulness is
sensitive to prompting design; (iii) the instruction-tuning phase improves
measured faithfulness on MedQA. These findings offer insights into strategies
for enhancing the interpretability and trustworthiness of LLMs in sensitive
domains.

Method: 1. 使用预训练CATT模型处理文本模态，Whisper模型处理语音模态
2. 开发早期融合（语音token平均+线性投影）和交叉注意力两种融合策略
3. 训练时随机禁用语音输入增强模型鲁棒性

Result: 开发集WER 0.25/CER 0.9，测试集WER 0.55/CER 0.13，显示多模态方法有效提升性能

Conclusion: 多模态融合显著提升阿拉伯语变音恢复效果，交叉注意力策略表现优异。模型具备语音输入缺失时的鲁棒性，为方言处理提供新思路。

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the Diacritic Restoration (DR) task for Arabic
dialectal sentences using a multimodal approach that combines both textual and
speech information. We propose a model that represents the text modality using
an encoder extracted from our own pre-trained model named CATT. The speech
component is handled by the encoder module of the OpenAI Whisper base model.
Our solution is designed following two integration strategies. The former
consists of fusing the speech tokens with the input at an early stage, where
the 1500 frames of the audio segment are averaged over 10 consecutive frames,
resulting in 150 speech tokens. To ensure embedding compatibility, these
averaged tokens are processed through a linear projection layer prior to
merging them with the text tokens. Contextual encoding is guaranteed by the
CATT encoder module. The latter strategy relies on cross-attention, where text
and speech embeddings are fused. The cross-attention output is then fed to the
CATT classification head for token-level diacritic prediction. To further
improve model robustness, we randomly deactivate the speech input during
training, allowing the model to perform well with or without speech. Our
experiments show that the proposed approach achieves a word error rate (WER) of
0.25 and a character error rate (CER) of 0.9 on the development set. On the
test set, our model achieved WER and CER scores of 0.55 and 0.13, respectively.

Motivation: LLM主要基于成人对话数据训练，在生成儿童适宜对话（尤其是挪威语等低资源语言）时面临年龄适配性不足的问题，缺乏针对不同年龄段儿童的专用词汇资源。

Method: 使用真实儿童访谈数据与5个LLM生成样本进行盲测对比，由11位教育专家评估语言真实性和年龄适配性，采用组内相关系数（ICC）衡量评估者一致性。

Result: 评估者对5岁组年龄预测准确率更高（ICC=0.75），GPT-4和NorBloom-7b表现相对较好，但多数模型生成语言复杂度超出目标年龄组水平。

Conclusion: 低资源语言环境下开发儿童专用LLM系统面临核心数据挑战，特别是缺乏覆盖不同年龄段的专用词汇库，导致生成对话难以实现精准年龄适配。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), predominantly trained on adult conversational
data, face significant challenges when generating authentic, child-like
dialogue for specialized applications. We present a comparative study
evaluating five different LLMs (GPT-4, RUTER-LLAMA-2-13b, GPTSW, NorMistral-7b,
and NorBloom-7b) to generate age-appropriate Norwegian conversations for
children aged 5 and 9 years. Through a blind evaluation by eleven education
professionals using both real child interview data and LLM-generated text
samples, we assessed authenticity and developmental appropriateness. Our
results show that evaluators achieved strong inter-rater reliability (ICC=0.75)
and demonstrated higher accuracy in age prediction for younger children
(5-year-olds) compared to older children (9-year-olds). While GPT-4 and
NorBloom-7b performed relatively well, most models generated language perceived
as more linguistically advanced than the target age groups. These findings
highlight critical data-related challenges in developing LLM systems for
specialized applications involving children, particularly in low-resource
languages where comprehensive age-appropriate lexical resources are scarce.

Conclusion: 记忆机制与权重空间的特殊结构相关联，数学/事实类任务依赖窄域权重通道，该发现为模型安全干预提供新范式。

Abstract: We characterize how memorization is represented in transformer models and
show that it can be disentangled in the weights of both language models (LMs)
and vision transformers (ViTs) using a decomposition based on the loss
landscape curvature. This insight is based on prior theoretical and empirical
work showing that the curvature for memorized training points is much sharper
than non memorized, meaning ordering weight components from high to low
curvature can reveal a distinction without explicit labels. This motivates a
weight editing procedure that suppresses far more recitation of untargeted
memorized data more effectively than a recent unlearning method
(BalancedSubnet), while maintaining lower perplexity. Since the basis of
curvature has a natural interpretation for shared structure in model weights,
we analyze the editing procedure extensively on its effect on downstream tasks
in LMs, and find that fact retrieval and arithmetic are specifically and
consistently negatively affected, even though open book fact retrieval and
general logical reasoning is conserved. We posit these tasks rely heavily on
specialized directions in weight space rather than general purpose mechanisms,
regardless of whether those individual datapoints are memorized. We support
this by showing a correspondence between task data's activation strength with
low curvature components that we edit out, and the drop in task performance
after the edit. Our work enhances the understanding of memorization in neural
networks with practical applications towards removing it, and provides evidence
for idiosyncratic, narrowly-used structures involved in solving tasks like math
and fact retrieval.

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在语言与智能体内部表征对齐方面存在局限性，需进一步研究提升跨模态表征鲁棒性的方法。

Abstract: Emergent symbolic representations are critical for enabling developmental
learning agents to plan and generalize across tasks. In this work, we
investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can translate human natural
language instructions into the internal symbolic representations that emerge
during hierarchical reinforcement learning. We apply a structured evaluation
framework to measure the translation performance of commonly seen LLMs -- GPT,
Claude, Deepseek and Grok -- across different internal symbolic partitions
generated by a hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm in the Ant Maze
and Ant Fall environments. Our findings reveal that although LLMs demonstrate
some ability to translate natural language into a symbolic representation of
the environment dynamics, their performance is highly sensitive to partition
granularity and task complexity. The results expose limitations in current LLMs
capacity for representation alignment, highlighting the need for further
research on robust alignment between language and internal agent
representations.

Conclusion: 现有NLI模型在最小修改问题上仍存在泛化缺陷，MERGE为评估模型推理泛化能力提供了有效工具

Abstract: In recent years, many generalization benchmarks have shown language models'
lack of robustness in natural language inference (NLI). However, manually
creating new benchmarks is costly, while automatically generating high-quality
ones, even by modifying existing benchmarks, is extremely difficult. In this
paper, we propose a methodology for automatically generating high-quality
variants of original NLI problems by replacing open-class words, while
crucially preserving their underlying reasoning. We dub our generalization test
as MERGE (Minimal Expression-Replacements GEneralization), which evaluates the
correctness of models' predictions across reasoning-preserving variants of the
original problem. Our results show that NLI models' perform 4-20% worse on
variants, suggesting low generalizability even on such minimally altered
problems. We also analyse how word class of the replacements, word probability,
and plausibility influence NLI models' performance.

Result: 在GRPO和DAPO算法上平均加速策略学习131%，不同推理任务pass@1指标提升4.2%

Conclusion: LATR通过轨迹级多样性增强机制有效突破现有RLVR方法瓶颈，实验验证其显著优势，代码数据已开源

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), particularly with
algorithms like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), has proven highly
effective in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models.
However, a critical bottleneck in current pipelines lies in the limited
diversity of sampled trajectories during group rollouts. Homogeneous
trajectories and their associated rewards would diminish the return signals for
policy updates, thereby hindering effective policy learning. This lack of
diversity stems primarily from token-level stochastic sampling, where local
variations are likely to collapse into near-identical reasoning paths. To
address this limitation, we propose Lookahead Tree-Based Rollouts (LATR), a
novel rollout strategy designed to explicitly promotes trajectory-level
diversity by enforcing branching into different candidate tokens likely to
yield distinct continuations. Specifically, LATR iteratively operates in three
stages: (1) branching at high-uncertainty generation steps, (2) performing
lookahead simulation for each new branch, and (3) pruning branches that
exhibits prolonged similarity during simulation. Compared with stochastic
Sampling, LATR accelerates policy learning by 131% on average and improves
final pass@1 performance by 4.2% on both GRPO and Dynamic sAmpling Policy
Optimization (DAPO) algorithms across different reasoning tasks. Our code and
data are publicly available at https://github.com/starreeze/latr.

Conclusion: 该方法突破了传统强监督限制，为语言模型的自主优化提供了新思路，尤其在跨领域适应性方面展现强大潜力。

Abstract: Training critiquing language models to assess and provide feedback on model
outputs is a promising way to improve LLMs for complex reasoning tasks.
However, existing approaches typically rely on stronger supervisors for
annotating critique data. To address this, we propose Critique-RL, an online RL
approach for developing critiquing language models without stronger
supervision. Our approach operates on a two-player paradigm: the actor
generates a response, the critic provides feedback, and the actor refines the
response accordingly. We first reveal that relying solely on indirect reward
signals from the actor's outputs for RL optimization often leads to
unsatisfactory critics: while their helpfulness (i.e., providing constructive
feedback) improves, the discriminability (i.e., determining whether a response
is high-quality or not) remains poor, resulting in marginal performance gains.
To overcome this, Critique-RL adopts a two-stage optimization strategy. In
stage I, it reinforces the discriminability of the critic with direct
rule-based reward signals; in stage II, it introduces indirect rewards based on
actor refinement to improve the critic's helpfulness, while maintaining its
discriminability via appropriate regularization. Extensive experiments across
various tasks and models show that Critique-RL delivers substantial performance
improvements. For example, it achieves a 9.02% gain on in-domain tasks and a

*Hunzalah Hassan Bhatti,Firoj Alam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出结合多语言翻译、问题类型转换和思维链微调的方法，揭示LLMs在阿拉伯方言和文化知识上的缺陷，并发布首个多语言对齐数据集


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在文化相关内容和方言处理上的性能不平衡问题，促进语言包容性评估

Method: 1) 将标准阿拉伯语选择题翻译成英语和方言 2) 转为开放式问题 3) 测试零样本/微调模型 4) 生成思维链进行逐步推理微调

Result: 1) 模型在方言上表现差 2) 阿拉伯中心模型选择题优但开放题弱 3) 思维链提升判断正确性但n-gram指标波动

Conclusion: 需加强LLMs的方言和文化理解能力，思维链效果需多维度评估，公开数据集支持语言包容性研究

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to answer everyday
questions, yet their performance on culturally grounded and dialectal content
remains uneven across languages. We propose a comprehensive method that (i)
translates Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) multiple-choice questions (MCQs) into
English and several Arabic dialects, (ii) converts them into open-ended
questions (OEQs), (iii) benchmarks a range of zero-shot and fine-tuned LLMs
under both MCQ and OEQ settings, and (iv) generates chain-of-thought (CoT)
rationales to fine-tune models for step-by-step reasoning. Using this method,
we extend an existing dataset in which QAs are parallelly aligned across
multiple language varieties, making it, to our knowledge, the first of its
kind. We conduct extensive experiments with both open and closed models. Our
findings show that (i) models underperform on Arabic dialects, revealing
persistent gaps in culturally grounded and dialect-specific knowledge; (ii)
Arabic-centric models perform well on MCQs but struggle with OEQs; and (iii)
CoT improves judged correctness while yielding mixed n-gram-based metrics. The
developed dataset will be publicly released to support further research on
culturally and linguistically inclusive evaluation.

TL;DR: LongWeave框架通过CoV-Eval评估方法，平衡真实场景与可验证性，揭示顶尖大模型在复杂长文本生成中的显著挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长文本生成基准测试存在真实场景评估难以验证或合成场景脱离现实的问题，需开发兼具真实性和客观性的评估体系。

Method: 提出约束验证评估(CoV-Eval)：1) 在真实场景中定义可验证目标；2) 系统生成对应查询、文本材料及约束条件，支持定制化输入输出长度（最高64K/8K tokens），涵盖7类任务场景。

Result: 对23个大模型的测试表明，随着任务复杂性和输出长度增加，即使是顶尖模型也难以满足真实场景的长文本生成约束。

Conclusion: LongWeave揭示了当前大模型在长文本生成领域的局限性，并为系统化评估模型在真实复杂场景下的表现提供了有效框架。

Abstract: Generating long, informative, and factual outputs remains a major challenge
for Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing benchmarks for long-form generation
typically assess real-world queries with hard-to-verify metrics or use
synthetic setups that ease evaluation but overlook real-world intricacies. In
this paper, we introduce \textbf{LongWeave}, which balances real-world and
verifiable assessment with Constraint-Verifier Evaluation (CoV-Eval). CoV-Eval
constructs tasks by first defining verifiable targets within real-world
scenarios, then systematically generating corresponding queries, textual
materials, and constraints based on these targets. This ensures that tasks are
both realistic and objectively assessable, enabling rigorous assessment of
model capabilities in meeting complex real-world constraints. LongWeave
supports customizable input/output lengths (up to 64K/8K tokens) across seven
distinct tasks. Evaluation on 23 LLMs shows that even state-of-the-art models
encounter significant challenges in long-form generation as real-world
complexity and output length increase.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索句子嵌入解码重构文本的可行性，解决现有文本简化模型参数量大、计算成本高的问题

Method: 使用前馈神经网络学习高/低复杂度文本的嵌入转换，对比Seq2Seq和LLM方法，验证跨语言（ES,DE）和跨数据集（MedEASI）的泛化能力

Result: 小规模模型效果媲美大模型，在未训练语言和数据集上保持有效性，重构文本复杂度控制成功

Conclusion: 句子嵌入空间转换为开发小型高效文本生成模型开辟新方向，具有跨语言迁移的应用潜力

Abstract: Sentence embeddings can be decoded to give approximations of the original
texts used to create them. We explore this effect in the context of text
simplification, demonstrating that reconstructed text embeddings preserve
complexity levels. We experiment with a small feed forward neural network to
effectively learn a transformation between sentence embeddings representing
high-complexity and low-complexity texts. We provide comparison to a Seq2Seq
and LLM-based approach, showing encouraging results in our much smaller
learning setting. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our
transformation to an unseen simplification dataset (MedEASI), as well as
datasets from languages outside the training data (ES,DE). We conclude that
learning transformations in sentence embedding space is a promising direction
for future research and has potential to unlock the ability to develop small,
but powerful models for text simplification and other natural language
generation tasks.

TL;DR: 提出COMPEFFDIST框架，通过自动指令生成和数据过滤实现高效情感分析蒸馏，3B小模型性能匹敌20倍大模型，数据效率提升10倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感分析蒸馏方法存在两大缺陷：(1)人工指令覆盖不足限制知识迁移完整性 (2)大规模用户文本导致计算成本过高

Method: 1.基于属性的自动指令构建（扩展指令多样性）
2.难度导向的数据过滤机制（提升训练数据效率）

Result: 跨模型系列(Llama/Qwen/Gemma)验证：
- 3B学生模型性能匹配70B教师模型
- 仅需10%数据达到基线同等准确率

Conclusion: 该框架有效突破传统蒸馏瓶颈，为轻量化情感分析模型落地提供新思路

Abstract: Recent efforts leverage knowledge distillation techniques to develop
lightweight and practical sentiment analysis models. These methods are grounded
in human-written instructions and large-scale user texts. Despite the promising
results, two key challenges remain: (1) manually written instructions are
limited in diversity and quantity, making them insufficient to ensure
comprehensive coverage of distilled knowledge; (2) large-scale user texts incur
high computational cost, hindering the practicality of these methods. To this
end, we introduce COMPEFFDIST, a comprehensive and efficient distillation
framework for sentiment analysis. Our framework consists of two key modules:
attribute-based automatic instruction construction and difficulty-based data
filtering, which correspondingly tackle the aforementioned challenges. Applying
our method across multiple model series (Llama-3, Qwen-3, and Gemma-3), we
enable 3B student models to match the performance of 20x larger teacher models
on most tasks. In addition, our approach greatly outperforms baseline methods
in data efficiency, attaining the same performance level with only 10% of the
data.

TL;DR: 提出SynthWorlds框架构建真实/合成平行世界，通过镜像任务分离语言模型的推理能力与知识记忆，揭示参数知识带来的持续性能优势差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法难以区分语言模型的推理能力与参数知识记忆，导致基准测试结果可能反映的是事实回忆而非真实推理能力。

Method: 1. 构建结构相同的真实映射世界（可调用参数知识）和合成映射世界（参数知识无效）
2. 设计多跳问答和页面导航等镜像任务
3. 在闭卷QA和检索增强两种设置下对比模型表现

Result: 发现参数知识带来的优势差距持续存在（真实世界性能显著优于合成世界），知识整合机制可缩小但无法完全消除该差距。

Conclusion: SynthWorlds为评估语言模型提供了可控环境，首次实现推理能力与记忆能力的精确量化比较，揭示了现有系统在知识整合方面的改进空间。

Abstract: Evaluating the reasoning ability of language models (LMs) is complicated by
their extensive parametric world knowledge, where benchmark performance often
reflects factual recall rather than genuine reasoning. Existing datasets and
approaches (e.g., temporal filtering, paraphrasing, adversarial substitution)
cannot cleanly separate the two. We present SynthWorlds, a framework that
disentangles task reasoning complexity from factual knowledge. In SynthWorlds,
we construct parallel corpora representing two worlds with identical
interconnected structure: a real-mapped world, where models may exploit
parametric knowledge, and a synthetic-mapped world, where such knowledge is
meaningless. On top of these corpora, we design two mirrored tasks as case
studies: multi-hop question answering and page navigation, which maintain equal
reasoning difficulty across worlds. Experiments in parametric-only (e.g.,
closed-book QA) and knowledge-augmented (e.g., retrieval-augmented) LM settings
reveal a persistent knowledge advantage gap, defined as the performance boost
models gain from memorized parametric world knowledge. Knowledge acquisition
and integration mechanisms reduce but do not eliminate this gap, highlighting
opportunities for system improvements. Fully automatic and scalable,
SynthWorlds provides a controlled environment for evaluating LMs in ways that
were previously challenging, enabling precise and testable comparisons of
reasoning and memorization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言环境下缺乏高质量指令调优数据，限制了大语言模型的实际应用效果。

Method: 基于原生卢森堡语文本，选用擅长该语言的DeepSeek-R1-0528模型合成数据，并采用LLM作为评判的质量验证机制。

Result: 不同规模模型在语言能力测试中表现差异显著，部分模型微调后未达预期提升效果。

Conclusion: LuxIT填补了卢森堡语NLP资源空白，但需探索更有效的数据应用策略以提升模型性能。

Abstract: The effectiveness of instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) is often
limited in low-resource linguistic settings due to a lack of high-quality
training data. We introduce LuxIT, a novel, monolingual instruction tuning
dataset for Luxembourgish developed to mitigate this challenge. We synthesize
the dataset from a corpus of native Luxembourgish texts, utilizing
DeepSeek-R1-0528, chosen for its shown proficiency in Luxembourgish. Following
generation, we apply a quality assurance process, employing an LLM-as-a-judge
approach. To investigate the practical utility of the dataset, we fine-tune
several smaller-scale LLMs on LuxIT. Subsequent benchmarking against their base
models on Luxembourgish language proficiency examinations, however, yields
mixed results, with performance varying significantly across different models.
LuxIT represents a critical contribution to Luxembourgish natural language
processing and offers a replicable monolingual methodology, though our findings
highlight the need for further research to optimize its application.

TL;DR: 研究评估GPT-4o、Ansari AI和Fanar在伊斯兰指导任务中的表现，发现现有模型在宗教准确性方面仍存在不足，强调需要建立穆斯林视角的评估基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在伊斯兰知识领域存在误引经典、误用教法解释和文化适配性差的风险，需系统性评估模型输出的宗教可靠性。

Method: 采用双代理评估框架：定量代理验证引用并评估六个维度（包括伊斯兰准确性、引文质量），定性代理进行五维度对比（如原创性、文化敏感性）。

Result: GPT-4o伊斯兰准确性得分最高（3.93/5），但所有模型在可靠生成宗教内容方面均未达标。Ansari AI在定性比较中获胜最多（116/200），Fanar在阿拉伯语境处理有创新。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁建立社区驱动的评估体系，为伊斯兰知识及其他高风险领域（医疗/法律）的AI应用提供可靠性保障，推动文化敏感型AI发展。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used for Islamic guidance, but risk
misquoting texts, misapplying jurisprudence, or producing culturally
inconsistent responses. We pilot an evaluation of GPT-4o, Ansari AI, and Fanar
on prompts from authentic Islamic blogs. Our dual-agent framework uses a
quantitative agent for citation verification and six-dimensional scoring (e.g.,
Structure, Islamic Consistency, Citations) and a qualitative agent for
five-dimensional side-by-side comparison (e.g., Tone, Depth, Originality).
GPT-4o scored highest in Islamic Accuracy (3.93) and Citation (3.38), Ansari AI
followed (3.68, 3.32), and Fanar lagged (2.76, 1.82). Despite relatively strong
performance, models still fall short in reliably producing accurate Islamic
content and citations -- a paramount requirement in faith-sensitive writing.
GPT-4o had the highest mean quantitative score (3.90/5), while Ansari AI led
qualitative pairwise wins (116/200). Fanar, though trailing, introduces
innovations for Islamic and Arabic contexts. This study underscores the need
for community-driven benchmarks centering Muslim perspectives, offering an
early step toward more reliable AI in Islamic knowledge and other high-stakes
domains such as medicine, law, and journalism.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注图像输入扰动，而用户实际使用中相同语义的多样化文本改述对分割模型鲁棒性的影响尚未充分探索

Method: 开发基于文本自编码器语义潜空间的黑盒优化方法SPARTA，结合强化学习生成语法正确但使分割失效的对抗性改述

Result: SPARTA在ReasonSeg和LLMSeg-40k数据集上的成功率比基线方法提升2倍，验证先进模型在严格约束下仍存在漏洞

Conclusion: 当前推理分割模型对语义保持的对抗性改述缺乏鲁棒性，需开发更强大的防御机制应对真实场景中的多样化查询

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
in vision-language tasks such as reasoning segmentation, where models generate
segmentation masks based on textual queries. While prior work has primarily
focused on perturbing image inputs, semantically equivalent textual
paraphrases-crucial in real-world applications where users express the same
intent in varied ways-remain underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a
novel adversarial paraphrasing task: generating grammatically correct
paraphrases that preserve the original query meaning while degrading
segmentation performance. To evaluate the quality of adversarial paraphrases,
we develop a comprehensive automatic evaluation protocol validated with human
studies. Furthermore, we introduce SPARTA-a black-box, sentence-level
optimization method that operates in the low-dimensional semantic latent space
of a text autoencoder, guided by reinforcement learning. SPARTA achieves
significantly higher success rates, outperforming prior methods by up to 2x on
both the ReasonSeg and LLMSeg-40k datasets. We use SPARTA and competitive
baselines to assess the robustness of advanced reasoning segmentation models.
We reveal that they remain vulnerable to adversarial paraphrasing-even under
strict semantic and grammatical constraints. All code and data will be released
publicly upon acceptance.

Abstract: While new benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) are being developed
continuously to catch up with the growing capabilities of new models and AI in
general, using and evaluating LLMs in non-English languages remains a
little-charted landscape. We give a concise overview of recent developments in
LLM benchmarking, and then propose a new taxonomy for the categorization of
benchmarks that is tailored to multilingual or non-English use scenarios. We
further propose a set of best practices and quality standards that could lead
to a more coordinated development of benchmarks for European languages. Among
other recommendations, we advocate for a higher language and culture
sensitivity of evaluation methods.

Method: 迭代式生成-反馈流程：LLM生成器生成初稿→基于配置文件的批评LLM提供结构化反馈→淘汰策略保留优质版本，附加Best-of-N和主题提取策略平衡质量效率

Result: 在Yelp/Goodreads/Amazon数据集上GEval提升7-13%，3-5次迭代效果稳定提升，批评模型规模扩大时扩展性良好

Conclusion: 事后配置文件反馈机制为个性化LLM生成提供了强大范式，兼具训练自由和模型通用性优势

Abstract: Personalized text generation requires models not only to produce coherent
text but also to align with a target user's style, tone, and topical focus.
Existing retrieval-augmented approaches such as LaMP and PGraphRAG enrich
profiles with user and neighbor histories, but they stop at generation and
often yield outputs that drift in tone, topic, or style. We present PerFine, a
unified, training-free critique-refine framework that enhances personalization
through iterative, profile-grounded feedback. In each iteration, an LLM
generator produces a draft conditioned on the retrieved profile, and a critic
LLM - also conditioned on the same profile - provides structured feedback on
tone, vocabulary, sentence structure, and topicality. The generator then
revises, while a novel knockout strategy retains the stronger draft across
iterations. We further study additional inference-time strategies such as
Best-of-N and Topic Extraction to balance quality and efficiency. Across Yelp,
Goodreads, and Amazon datasets, PerFine consistently improves personalization
over PGraphRAG, with GEval gains of +7-13%, steady improvements over 3-5
refinement iterations, and scalability with increasing critic size. These
results highlight that post-hoc, profile-aware feedback offers a powerful
paradigm for personalized LLM generation that is both training-free and
model-agnostic.

Abstract: Hallucination remains one of the key obstacles to the reliable deployment of
large language models (LLMs), particularly in real-world applications. Among
various mitigation strategies, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and
reasoning enhancement have emerged as two of the most effective and widely
adopted approaches, marking a shift from merely suppressing hallucinations to
balancing creativity and reliability. However, their synergistic potential and
underlying mechanisms for hallucination mitigation have not yet been
systematically examined. This survey adopts an application-oriented perspective
of capability enhancement to analyze how RAG, reasoning enhancement, and their
integration in Agentic Systems mitigate hallucinations. We propose a taxonomy
distinguishing knowledge-based and logic-based hallucinations, systematically
examine how RAG and reasoning address each, and present a unified framework
supported by real-world applications, evaluations, and benchmarks.

Abstract: Scientific talks are a growing medium for disseminating research, and
automatically identifying relevant literature that grounds or enriches a talk
would be highly valuable for researchers and students alike. We introduce
Reference Prediction from Talks (RPT), a new task that maps long, and
unstructured scientific presentations to relevant papers. To support research
on RPT, we present Talk2Ref, the first large-scale dataset of its kind,
containing 6,279 talks and 43,429 cited papers (26 per talk on average), where
relevance is approximated by the papers cited in the talk's corresponding
source publication. We establish strong baselines by evaluating
state-of-the-art text embedding models in zero-shot retrieval scenarios, and
propose a dual-encoder architecture trained on Talk2Ref. We further explore
strategies for handling long transcripts, as well as training for domain
adaptation. Our results show that fine-tuning on Talk2Ref significantly
improves citation prediction performance, demonstrating both the challenges of
the task and the effectiveness of our dataset for learning semantic
representations from spoken scientific content. The dataset and trained models
are released under an open license to foster future research on integrating
spoken scientific communication into citation recommendation systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM隐含的社会偏见存在风险，但隐性偏见难以检测，需开发能评估模型内部知识表征的新方法。

Method: 通过生成词关联网络模拟语义启动效应，结合定量指标与定性分析，实现LLM与人类偏见的直接对比。

Result: 在性别/宗教/种族等维度揭示LLM与人类偏见的收敛与分歧，提供模型使用风险的新视角。

Conclusion: 建立可扩展的系统化评估框架，促进语言模型的透明化与社会责任对齐。

Abstract: As Large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into our
lives, their inherent social biases remain a pressing concern. Detecting and
evaluating these biases can be challenging because they are often implicit
rather than explicit in nature, so developing evaluation methods that assess
the implicit knowledge representations of LLMs is essential. We present a novel
word association network methodology for evaluating implicit biases in LLMs
based on simulating semantic priming within LLM-generated word association
networks. Our prompt-based approach taps into the implicit relational
structures encoded in LLMs, providing both quantitative and qualitative
assessments of bias. Unlike most prompt-based evaluation methods, our method
enables direct comparisons between various LLMs and humans, providing a
valuable point of reference and offering new insights into the alignment of
LLMs with human cognition. To demonstrate the utility of our methodology, we
apply it to both humans and several widely used LLMs to investigate social
biases related to gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and
political party. Our results reveal both convergences and divergences between
LLM and human biases, providing new perspectives on the potential risks of
using LLMs. Our methodology contributes to a systematic, scalable, and
generalizable framework for evaluating and comparing biases across multiple
LLMs and humans, advancing the goal of transparent and socially responsible
language technologies.

Result: 支持多样化场景布局、高效生成与灵活编辑，继承对象级模型的泛化能力且无需场景级数据训练

Conclusion: 建立了基于语言驱动的通用三维场景构建框架，通过模块化设计实现语义控制与场景扩展性平衡

Abstract: Text-driven 3D scene generation holds promise for a wide range of
applications, from virtual prototyping to AR/VR and simulation. However,
existing methods are often constrained to single-object generation, require
domain-specific training, or lack support for full 360-degree viewability. In
this work, we present a training-free approach to 3D scene synthesis by
repurposing general-purpose text-to-3D object diffusion models as modular tile
generators. We reformulate scene generation as a multi-tile denoising problem,
where overlapping 3D regions are independently generated and seamlessly blended
via weighted averaging. This enables scalable synthesis of large, coherent
scenes while preserving local semantic control. Our method eliminates the need
for scene-level datasets or retraining, relies on minimal heuristics, and
inherits the generalization capabilities of object-level priors. We demonstrate
that our approach supports diverse scene layouts, efficient generation, and
flexible editing, establishing a simple yet powerful foundation for
general-purpose, language-driven 3D scene construction.

Result: 在保持与原始NeuralRTI相当的存储效率前提下，实现计算成本降低且不损失成像质量

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了神经渲染方法在有限硬件条件下的实用性问题，为文化遗产数字化等领域提供更可行的解决方案

Abstract: Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) is very popular for its ability to
visually analyze surfaces by enhancing surface details through interactive
relighting, starting from only a few tens of photographs taken with a fixed
camera and variable illumination. Traditional methods like Polynomial Texture
Maps (PTM) and Hemispherical Harmonics (HSH) are compact and fast, but struggle
to accurately capture complex reflectance fields using few per-pixel
coefficients and fixed bases, leading to artifacts, especially in highly
reflective or shadowed areas. The NeuralRTI approach, which exploits a neural
autoencoder to learn a compact function that better approximates the local
reflectance as a function of light directions, has been shown to produce
superior quality at comparable storage cost. However, as it performs
interactive relighting with custom decoder networks with many parameters, the
rendering step is computationally expensive and not feasible at full resolution
for large images on limited hardware. Earlier attempts to reduce costs by
directly training smaller networks have failed to produce valid results. For
this reason, we propose to reduce its computational cost through a novel
solution based on Knowledge Distillation (DisK-NeuralRTI). ...
