We\nspecifically focus on examining how unbalanced training data with ELLs\ncontributes to scoring bias and disparities. We fine-tuned BERT with four\ndatasets: responses from (1) ELLs, (2) non-ELLs, (3) a mixed dataset reflecting\nthe real-world proportion of ELLs and non-ELLs (unbalanced), and (4) a balanced\nmixed dataset with equal representation of both groups. The study analyzed 21\nassessment items: 10 items with about 30,000 ELL responses, five items with\nabout 1,000 ELL responses, and six items with about 200 ELL responses. Scoring\naccuracy (Acc) was calculated and compared to identify bias using Friedman\ntests. We measured the Mean Score Gaps (MSGs) between ELLs and non-ELLs and\nthen calculated the differences in MSGs generated through both the human and AI\nmodels to identify the scoring disparities. We found that no AI bias and\ndistorted disparities between ELLs and non-ELLs were found when the training\ndataset was large enough (ELL = 30,000 and ELL = 1,000), but concerns could\nexist if the sample size is limited (ELL = 200)."}

Prior\napproaches for efficient test-time scaling, typically using universal budget\nconstraints or query-level length optimization, do not leverage historical\ninformation from previous encounters with the same problem during training. We\nhypothesize that this limits their ability to progressively make solutions more\nconcise over time. To address this, we present History-Aware Policy\nOptimization (HAPO), which keeps track of a history state (e.g., the minimum\nlength over previously generated correct responses) for each problem. HAPO\nemploys a novel length reward function based on this history state to\nincentivize the discovery of correct solutions that are more concise than those\npreviously found. Crucially, this reward structure avoids overly penalizing\nshorter incorrect responses with the goal of facilitating exploration towards\nmore efficient solutions. By combining this length reward with a correctness\nreward, HAPO jointly optimizes for correctness and efficiency. We use HAPO to\ntrain DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview, and\nQwen-2.5-1.5B-Instruct, and evaluate HAPO on several math benchmarks that span\nvarious difficulty levels.

Such latent thoughts encode\ninformative thinking without the information loss associated with\nautoregressive token generation, sparking increased interest in\ncontinuous-space reasoning.

We present CompAlign, a challenging benchmark with an emphasis on\nassessing the depiction of 3D-spatial relationships, for evaluating and\nimproving models on compositional image generation. CompAlign consists of 900\ncomplex multi-subject image generation prompts that combine numerical and\n3D-spatial relationships with varied attribute bindings. Our benchmark is\nremarkably challenging, incorporating generation tasks with 3+ generation\nsubjects with complex 3D-spatial relationships. Additionally, we propose\nCompQuest, an interpretable and accurate evaluation framework that decomposes\ncomplex prompts into atomic sub-questions, then utilizes a MLLM to provide\nfine-grained binary feedback on the correctness of each aspect of generation\nelements in model-generated images. This enables precise quantification of\nalignment between generated images and compositional prompts. Furthermore, we\npropose an alignment framework that uses CompQuest's feedback as preference\nsignals to improve diffusion models' compositional image generation abilities.\nUsing adjustable per-image preferences, our method is easily scalable and\nflexible for different tasks. Evaluation of 9 T2I models reveals that: (1)\nmodels remarkable struggle more with compositional tasks with more complex\n3D-spatial configurations, and (2) a noticeable performance gap exists between\nopen-source accessible models and closed-source commercial models. Further\nempirical study on using CompAlign for model alignment yield promising results:\npost-alignment diffusion models achieve remarkable improvements in\ncompositional accuracy, especially on complex generation tasks, outperforming\nprevious approaches."}

Given a sequence of previous values,\nnext-token prediction assigns a probability to each possible next value in the\nvocabulary. There are many ways to use next-token prediction to output token\nsequences. This paper examines a few of these algorithms (greedy, lookahead,\nrandom sampling, and temperature-scaled random sampling) and studies their\nconsistency with respect to various goals encoded as loss functions. Although\nconsistency of surrogate losses with respect to a target loss function is a\nwell researched topic, we are the first to study it in the context of LLMs (to\nthe best of our knowledge). We find that, so long as next-token prediction\nconverges to its true probability distribution, random sampling is consistent\nwith outputting sequences that mimic sampling from the true probability\ndistribution. For the other goals, such as minimizing the 0-1 loss on the\nentire sequence, we show no polynomial-time algorithm is optimal for all\nprobability distributions and all decoding algorithms studied are only optimal\nfor a subset of probability distributions. When analyzing these results, we see\nthat there is a dichotomy created between the goals of information retrieval\nand creative generation for the decoding algorithms. This shows that choosing\nthe correct decoding algorithm based on the desired goal is extremely important\nand many of the ones used are lacking theoretical grounding in numerous\nscenarios."}

Although the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) remains the standard for TTS\nSystem evaluation, it suffers from subjectivity, environmental inconsistencies,\nand limited interpretability. Existing evaluation datasets also lack a\nmulti-dimensional design, often neglecting factors such as speaking styles,\ncontext diversity, and trap utterances, which is particularly evident in\nChinese TTS evaluation. To address these challenges, we introduce the Audio\nTuring Test (ATT), a multi-dimensional Chinese corpus dataset ATT-Corpus paired\nwith a simple, Turing-Test-inspired evaluation protocol. Instead of relying on\ncomplex MOS scales or direct model comparisons, ATT asks evaluators to judge\nwhether a voice sounds human. This simplification reduces rating bias and\nimproves evaluation robustness. To further support rapid model development, we\nalso finetune Qwen2-Audio-Instruct with human judgment data as Auto-ATT for\nautomatic evaluation. Experimental results show that ATT effectively\ndifferentiates models across specific capability dimensions using its\nmulti-dimensional design. Auto-ATT also demonstrates strong alignment with\nhuman evaluations, confirming its value as a fast and reliable assessment tool.\nThe white-box ATT-Corpus and Auto-ATT can be found in ATT Hugging Face\nCollection\n(https://huggingface.co/collections/meituan/audio-turing-test-682446320368164faeaf38a4)."}

To address this challenge, we propose SelfBudgeter - a self-adaptive\ncontrollable reasoning strategy for efficient reasoning. Our approach adopts a\ndual-phase training paradigm: first, the model learns to pre-estimate the\nreasoning cost based on the difficulty of the query. Then, we introduce\nbudget-guided GPRO for reinforcement learning, which effectively maintains\naccuracy while reducing output length. SelfBudgeter allows users to anticipate\ngeneration time and make informed decisions about continuing or interrupting\nthe process.

Recent advances in\nMultimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly enhanced their\ncapabilities in this area. However, MLLMs often suffer from hallucinations,\ngenerating irrelevant or nonsensical content. To the best of our knowledge,\ndespite the importance of this issue, there has been no dedicated effort to\nevaluate emotion-related hallucinations in MLLMs. In this work, we introduce\nEmotionHallucer, the first benchmark for detecting and analyzing emotion\nhallucinations in MLLMs. Unlike humans, whose emotion understanding stems from\nthe interplay of biology and social learning, MLLMs rely solely on data-driven\nlearning and lack innate emotional instincts. Fortunately, emotion psychology\nprovides a solid foundation of knowledge about human emotions. Building on\nthis, we assess emotion hallucinations from two dimensions: emotion psychology\nknowledge and real-world multimodal perception. To support robust evaluation,\nwe utilize an adversarial binary question-answer (QA) framework, which employs\ncarefully crafted basic and hallucinated pairs to assess the emotion\nhallucination tendencies of MLLMs. By evaluating 38 LLMs and MLLMs on\nEmotionHallucer, we reveal that: i) most current models exhibit substantial\nissues with emotion hallucinations; ii) closed-source models outperform\nopen-source ones in detecting emotion hallucinations, and reasoning capability\nprovides additional advantages; iii) existing models perform better in emotion\npsychology knowledge than in multimodal emotion perception. As a byproduct,\nthese findings inspire us to propose the PEP-MEK framework, which yields an\naverage improvement of 9.90% in emotion hallucination detection across selected\nmodels.

In this work, we argue that language may not always be the most\nnatural or effective modality for reasoning, particularly in tasks involving\nspatial and geometrical information. Motivated by this, we propose a new\nparadigm, Visual Planning, which enables planning through purely visual\nrepresentations, independent of text. In this paradigm, planning is executed\nvia sequences of images that encode step-by-step inference in the visual\ndomain, akin to how humans sketch or visualize future actions. We introduce a\nnovel reinforcement learning framework, Visual Planning via Reinforcement\nLearning (VPRL), empowered by GRPO for post-training large vision models,\nleading to substantial improvements in planning in a selection of\nrepresentative visual navigation tasks, FrozenLake, Maze, and MiniBehavior. Our\nvisual planning paradigm outperforms all other planning variants that conduct\nreasoning in the text-only space. Our results establish Visual Planning as a\nviable and promising alternative to language-based reasoning, opening new\navenues for tasks that benefit from intuitive, image-based inference."}
