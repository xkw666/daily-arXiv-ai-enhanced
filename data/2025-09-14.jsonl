However, obtaining high-quality\nmeshes of engineering microstructures using these approaches remains an open\nquestion. In harmonic approaches, we usually reconstruct surfaces by evaluating\nthe harmonic bases on equidistantly sampled simplicial complexes of the base\ndomains (e.g., triangular spheroids and disks).

As it impacts the accuracy and time step, high-quality\ndiscretization of microstructures is crucial for efficient numerical\nsimulations (e.g., finite element and discrete element methods). To circumvent\nthis issue, we propose an efficient hierarchical diffusion-based approach for\nresampling the surface-i.e., performing a reparameterization-to yield an\nequalized mesh triangulation.

This orthogonal constraint\nensures theoretical guarantees in outlier suppression while achieving $O(n \\log\nn)$ computational complexity with only $\\frac{n \\log n}{2}$ learnable\nparameters. We further introduce a uniformity regularization on\npost-transformation activations to promote smoother distributions amenable to\nquantization. Learning requires only 128 calibration samples and converges in\nminutes on a single GPU--a negligible one-time cost. On LLaMA-2-7B with 2-bit\nquantization, ButterflyQuant achieves 15.4 perplexity versus 22.1 for QuaRot."}

To address this challenge, We introduce FLUX-Reason-6M\nand PRISM-Bench (Precise and Robust Image Synthesis Measurement Benchmark).\nFLUX-Reason-6M is a massive dataset consisting of 6 million high-quality\nFLUX-generated images and 20 million bilingual (English and Chinese)\ndescriptions specifically designed to teach complex reasoning. The image are\norganized according to six key characteristics: Imagination, Entity, Text\nrendering, Style, Affection, and Composition, and design explicit Generation\nChain-of-Thought (GCoT) to provide detailed breakdowns of image generation\nsteps. The whole data curation takes 15,000 A100 GPU days, providing the\ncommunity with a resource previously unattainable outside of large industrial\nlabs. PRISM-Bench offers a novel evaluation standard with seven distinct\ntracks, including a formidable Long Text challenge using GCoT. Through\ncarefully designed prompts, it utilizes advanced vision-language models for\nnuanced human-aligned assessment of prompt-image alignment and image\naesthetics. Our extensive evaluation of 19 leading models on PRISM-Bench\nreveals critical performance gaps and highlights specific areas requiring\nimprovement. Our dataset, benchmark, and evaluation code are released to\ncatalyze the next wave of reasoning-oriented T2I generation. Project page:\nhttps://flux-reason-6m.github.io/ ."}
