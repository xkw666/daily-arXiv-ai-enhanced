The\nsystem simultaneously inverts multiple vials and records videos of the evolving\nfluid, which are fed into a neural network that approximates the inverse\nfunction from visual features and known fluid density. Despite the complex,\nmulti-regime flow within the vial, our approach achieves relative errors below\n25%, improving to 15% for viscosities above 0.1 Pas.

We introduce\nTruthOverTricks, a unified evaluation paradigm for measuring shortcut learning\nin misinformation detection.

In this paper, we present KARE-RAG\n(Knowledge-Aware Refinement and Enhancement for RAG), which improves knowledge\nutilization through three key innovations: (1) structured knowledge\nrepresentations that facilitate error detection during training, (2) Dense\nDirect Preference Optimization (DDPO)-a refined training objective that\nprioritizes correction of critical errors, and (3) a contrastive data\ngeneration pipeline that maintains semantic consistency while rectifying\nfactual inaccuracies.

Hence, this\npaper explores the possibility of fine-grained MGT detection under human-AI\ncoauthoring. We suggest fine-grained detectors can pave pathways toward\ncoauthored text detection with a numeric AI ratio. Specifically, we propose a\ndataset, HACo-Det, which produces human-AI coauthored texts via an automatic\npipeline with word-level attribution labels. We retrofit seven prevailing\ndocument-level detectors to generalize them to word-level detection. Then we\nevaluate these detectors on HACo-Det on both word- and sentence-level detection\ntasks. Empirical results show that metric-based methods struggle to conduct\nfine-grained detection with a 0.462 average F1 score, while finetuned models\nshow superior performance and better generalization across domains. However, we\nargue that fine-grained co-authored text detection is far from solved. We\nfurther analyze factors influencing performance, e.g., context window, and\nhighlight the limitations of current methods, pointing to potential avenues for\nimprovement."}

Ideally, the choice of\nthe tokeniser -- which maps character-strings to subwords -- should not affect\nthe probability assigned to the underlying character-string; in practice, it\ndoes. We define this mismatch as tokenisation bias. In this work, we quantify\none particular type of tokenisation bias: the effect of including or not a\nsubword (e.g., $\\langle hello \\rangle$) in a tokeniser's vocabulary on the\nprobability a trained model assigns to the corresponding characters (i.e.,\n\\textit{``hello''}). Estimating this effect is challenging because each model\nis trained with only one tokeniser. We address this by framing tokenisation\nbias as a causal effect and estimating it using the regression discontinuity\ndesign. Specifically, we exploit the fact that tokenisation algorithms rank\nsubwords and add the first $K$ to a tokeniser's vocabulary, where $K$ is an\narbitrary cutoff point. As such, we can estimate a causal effect by comparing\nsimilar subwords around this cutoff. Experimentally, we find that tokenisation\nconsistently affects models' outputs across scales, vocabularies, and\ntokenisers. Notably, a subword's presence in a small model's vocabulary may\nincrease its characters' probability by up to 17 times, highlighting\ntokenisation as a key design choice in language modelling."}

This\nassumption arises frequently in practice, as precise token-level rewards are\noften difficult or infeasible to obtain in LLM applications. In this work, we\nprovide a unifying theoretical perspective. We introduce the Trajectory Policy\nGradient Theorem, which shows that the policy gradient based on true, unknown\ntoken-level rewards can be unbiasedly estimated using only a response-level\nreward model, regardless of whether the Zero-Reward Assumption holds or not,\nfor algorithms in the REINFORCE and Actor-Critic families. This result reveals\nthat widely used methods such as PPO, GRPO, ReMax, and RLOO inherently possess\nthe capacity to model token-level reward signals, offering a theoretical\njustification for response-level reward approaches. Our findings pave the way\nfor more practical, efficient LLM fine-tuning, allowing developers to treat\ntraining algorithms as black boxes and focus on improving the response-level\nreward model with auxiliary sub-models. We also offer a detailed analysis of\npopular RL and non-RL methods, comparing their theoretical foundations and\npractical advantages across common LLM tasks. Finally, we propose a new\nalgorithm: Token-Reinforced Policy Optimization (TRePO), a theoretically\ngrounded method that is simpler than PPO, matches GRPO in memory efficiency,\nand holds promise for broad applicability."}

In this paper, we investigate the reasoning trajectories of LRMs\nfrom an information-theoretic perspective. By tracking how mutual information\n(MI) between intermediate representations and the correct answer evolves during\nLRM reasoning, we observe an interesting MI peaks phenomenon: the MI at\nspecific generative steps exhibits a sudden and significant increase during\nLRM's reasoning process. We theoretically analyze such phenomenon and show that\nas MI increases, the probability of model's prediction error decreases.\nFurthermore, these MI peaks often correspond to tokens expressing reflection or\ntransition, such as ``Hmm'', ``Wait'' and ``Therefore,'' which we term as the\nthinking tokens. We then demonstrate that these thinking tokens are crucial for\nLRM's reasoning performance, while other tokens has minimal impacts. Building\non these analyses, we propose two simple yet effective methods to improve LRM's\nreasoning performance, by delicately leveraging these thinking tokens.
