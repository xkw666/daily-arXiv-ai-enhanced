We identify that\nthese artifacts stem from two key limitations: the lack of frequency\nconstraints in the representation and an ineffective screen-space clamping\napproach. To address these issues, we present AA-2DGS, an antialiased\nformulation of 2D Gaussian Splatting that maintains its geometric benefits\nwhile significantly enhancing rendering quality across different scales. Our\nmethod introduces a world space flat smoothing kernel that constrains the\nfrequency content of 2D Gaussian primitives based on the maximal sampling\nfrequency from training views, effectively eliminating high-frequency artifacts\nwhen zooming in.

While existing methods address\nthese hallucination types independently, they inadvertently induce performance\ntrade-offs, as interventions targeting one type often exacerbate the other.\nThrough empirical and theoretical analysis of activation space dynamics in\nLLMs, we reveal that these hallucination categories share overlapping subspaces\nwithin neural representations, presenting an opportunity for concurrent\nmitigation. To harness this insight, we propose SPACE, a unified framework that\njointly enhances factuality and faithfulness by editing shared activation\nsubspaces. SPACE establishes a geometric foundation for shared subspace\nexistence through dual-task feature modeling, then identifies and edits these\nsubspaces via a hybrid probe strategy combining spectral clustering and\nattention head saliency scoring.

Because efficiency has been the main metric of\nprogress, very little attention has been put in understanding possible\ncatastrophic failures. We uncover one such failure: PEFT encourages a model to\nsearch for shortcut solutions to solve its fine-tuning tasks. When very small\namount of tokens, e.g., one token per prompt, are correlated with downstream\ntask classes, PEFT makes any pretrained model rely predominantly on that token\nfor decision making. While such spurious tokens may emerge accidentally from\nincorrect data cleaning, it also opens opportunities for malevolent parties to\ncontrol a model's behavior from Seamless Spurious Token Injection (SSTI). In\nSSTI, a small amount of tokens correlated with downstream classes are injected\nby the dataset creators. At test time, the finetuned LLM's behavior can be\ncontrolled solely by injecting those few tokens. We apply SSTI across models\nfrom three families (Snowflake Arctic, Apple OpenELM, and Meta LLaMA-3) and\nfour diverse datasets (IMDB, Financial Classification, CommonSense QA, and Bias\nin Bios). Our findings reveal three astonishing behaviors. First, as few as a\nsingle token of SSTI is sufficient to steer a model's decision making. Second,\nfor light SSTI, the reliance on spurious tokens is proportional to the LoRA\nrank. Lastly, with aggressive SSTI, larger LoRA rank values become preferable\nto small rank values as it makes the model attend to non-spurious tokens, hence\nimproving robustness."}

For\nexample, when querying about domestic violence victims, a compromised RAG\nsystem might preferentially retrieve documents depicting women as victims,\ncausing the model to generate outputs that perpetuate gender stereotypes even\nwhen the original query is gender neutral. To show the impact of the bias, this\npaper proposes a Bias Retrieval and Reward Attack (BRRA) framework, which\nsystematically investigates attack pathways that amplify language model biases\nthrough a RAG system manipulation.

As the wave of general-purpose foundation models sweeps across\nvarious domains, their influence has significantly extended to the field of\nrecommendation systems. While recent efforts have explored recommendation\nfoundation models for various generative tasks, they often overlook crucial\nembedding tasks and struggle with the complexities of multi-task learning,\nincluding knowledge sharing & conflict resolution, and convergence speed\ninconsistencies. To address these limitations, we introduce RecFound, a\ngenerative representational learning framework for recommendation foundation\nmodels. We construct the first comprehensive dataset for recommendation\nfoundation models covering both generative and embedding tasks across diverse\nscenarios. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel multi-task training scheme\nfeaturing a Task-wise Mixture of Low-rank Experts (TMoLE) to handle knowledge\nsharing & conflict, a Step-wise Convergence-oriented Sample Scheduler (S2Sched)\nto address inconsistent convergence, and a Model Merge module to balance the\nperformance across tasks. Experiments demonstrate that RecFound achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across various recommendation tasks, outperforming\nexisting baselines."}
