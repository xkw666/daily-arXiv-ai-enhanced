The conjugate direction field (CDF) defined on the freeform surface plays a significant role in generating a PQ mesh, as it largely determines the PQ mesh layout. Conventionally, a CDF is obtained by solving a complex non-linear optimization problem that incorporates user preferences, i.e., aligning the CDF with user-specified strokes on the surface. This often requires a large number of iterations that are computationally expensive, preventing the interactive CDF design process for a desirable PQ mesh. To address this challenge, we propose a data-driven approach based on neural networks for controlled CDF generation. Our approach can effectively learn and fuse features from the freeform surface and the user strokes, and efficiently generate quality CDF respecting user guidance. To enable training and testing, we also present a dataset composed of 50000+ freeform surfaces with ground-truth CDFs, as well as a set of metrics for quantitative evaluation. The effectiveness and efficiency of our work are demonstrated by extensive experiments using testing data, architectural surfaces, and general 3D shapes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5171\u8f6d\u65b9\u5411\u573a\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5e73\u9762\u56db\u8fb9\u5f62\u7f51\u683c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6548\u7387", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfCDF\u751f\u6210\u4f9d\u8d56\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6d41\u7a0b", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u81ea\u7531\u66f2\u9762\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b14\u89e6\u8fdb\u884c\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60", "result": "\u6784\u5efa50,000+\u6837\u672c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5728\u5efa\u7b51\u66f2\u9762\u548c\u901a\u7528\u4e09\u7ef4\u5f62\u72b6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u53473\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a", "conclusion": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9a71\u52a8\u7684CDF\u751f\u6210\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5efa\u7b51\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6d41\u7a0b\u9769\u65b0"}}

Recent methods typically focus on the geometric structure of objects, producing grasps with diverse hand poses and plausible contact points. However, these approaches often overlook the physical attributes of the grasp, specifically the contact force, leading to reduced stability of the grasp. In this paper, we focus on stable grasp generation using explicit contact force predictions. First, we define a force-aware contact representation by transforming the normal force value into discrete levels and encoding it using a one-hot vector. Next, we introduce force-aware stability constraints. We define the stability problem as an acceleration minimization task and explicitly relate stability with contact geometry by formulating the underlying physical constraints. Finally, we present a pose optimizer that systematically integrates our contact representation and stability constraints to enable stable grasp generation. We show that these constraints can help identify key contact points for stability which provide effective initialization and guidance for optimization towards a stable grasp.

Traditional infrastructure planning is often slow and inaccessible, and although many architects are actively delivering humanitarian and aid-driven hospital projects worldwide, these vital efforts still fall far short of the sheer scale and urgency of demand. This paper introduces MedBuild AI, a hybrid-intelligence framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with deterministic expert systems to rebalance the early design and conceptual planning stages. As a web-based platform, it enables any region with satellite internet access to obtain guidance on modular, low-tech, low-cost medical building designs. The system operates through three agents: the first gathers local health intelligence via conversational interaction; the second translates this input into an architectural functional program through rule-based computation; and the third generates layouts and 3D models.

Unlike previous agents that only scale up model size or context length, MiroThinker explores interaction scaling at the model level, systematically training the model to handle deeper and more frequent agent-environment interactions as a third dimension of performance improvement. Unlike LLM test-time scaling, which operates in isolation and risks degradation with longer reasoning chains, interactive scaling leverages environment feedback and external information acquisition to correct errors and refine trajectories. Through reinforcement learning, the model achieves efficient interaction scaling: with a 256K context window, it can perform up to 600 tool calls per task, enabling sustained multi-turn reasoning and complex real-world research workflows. Across four representative benchmarks-GAIA, HLE, BrowseComp, and BrowseComp-ZH-the 72B variant achieves up to 81.9%, 37.7%, 47.1%, and 55.6% accuracy respectively, surpassing previous open-source agents and approaching commercial counterparts such as GPT-5-high. Our analysis reveals that MiroThinker benefits from interactive scaling consistently: research performance improves predictably as the model engages in deeper and more frequent agent-environment interactions, demonstrating that interaction depth exhibits scaling behaviors analogous to model size and context length. These findings establish interaction scaling as a third critical dimension for building next-generation open research agents, complementing model capacity and context windows.", "AI": {"tldr": "MiroThinker v1.0\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u4e92\u6269\u5c55\uff08interaction scaling\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u7814\u7a76\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5355\u4efb\u52a1600\u6b21\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u63a5\u8fd1\u5546\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u6a21\u578b\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u6269\u5c55\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u73af\u5883\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u6765\u4fee\u6b63\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4f20\u7edf\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21/\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4ea4\u4e92\u6269\u5c55\uff08256K\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u652f\u6301600\u6b21\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\uff09\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u591a\u8f6e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "72B\u6a21\u578b\u5728GAIA/HLE/BrowseComp\u7cfb\u5217\u57fa\u51c6\u53d6\u5f9781.9%/37.7%/47.1%/55.6%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f00\u6e90\u57fa\u7ebf\u63a5\u8fd1GPT-5-high\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ea4\u4e92\u6269\u5c55\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21/\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u6784\u6210\u6784\u5efa\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u7814\u7a76\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u7b2c\u4e09\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002"}}

We assess definitions of reasoning and how key papers in the field of natural language processing (NLP) use the notion and argue that the definitions provided are not consistent with how LMs are trained, process information, and generate new tokens. To illustrate this incommensurability we assume the view that transformer-based LMs implement an \\textit{implicit} finite-order Markov kernel mapping contexts to conditional token distributions. In this view, reasoning-like outputs correspond to statistical regularities and approximate statistical invariances in the learned kernel rather than the implementation of explicit logical mechanisms. This view is illustrative of the claim that LMs are \"statistical pattern matchers\"\" and not genuine reasoners and provides a perspective that clarifies why reasoning-like outputs arise in LMs without any guarantees of logical consistency.

While LLMs show promise in generating structured outputs from natural language (NL), such as Gherkin Scenarios from NL feature requirements, there's currently no formal method to verify if these outputs are accurate. This paper takes a preliminary step toward addressing this gap by exploring the use of a simple LLM-based autoformalizer to verify LLM-generated outputs against a small set of natural language requirements. We conducted two distinct experiments. In the first one, the autoformalizer successfully identified that two differently-worded NL requirements were logically equivalent, demonstrating the pipeline's potential for consistency checks. In the second, the autoformalizer was used to identify a logical inconsistency between a given NL requirement and an LLM-generated output, highlighting its utility as a formal verification tool. Our findings, while limited, suggest that autoformalization holds significant potential for ensuring the fidelity and logical consistency of LLM-generated outputs, laying a crucial foundation for future, more extensive studies into this novel application.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63a2\u7d22\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u903b\u8f91\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u521d\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8f93\u51fa\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u5de5\u5177\u786e\u4fdd\u903b\u8f91\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u9700\u6c42\u8fdb\u884c\u4e24\u7ec4\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u9700\u6c42\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u9700\u6c42\u4e0eLLM\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e00\u6210\u529f\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b49\u4ef7\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e8c\u53d1\u73b0\u9700\u6c42\u4e0eLLM\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5de5\u5177\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u52a8\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3aLLM\u8f93\u51fa\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u521d\u6b65\u6210\u679c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Effective representation learning of road networks remains challenging due to the complex interplay between spatial structures and frequency characteristics in traffic patterns. Existing graph neural networks for modeling road networks predominantly fall into two paradigms: spatial-based methods that capture local topology but tend to over-smooth representations, and spectral-based methods that analyze global frequency components but often overlook localized variations. This spatial-spectral misalignment limits their modeling capacity for road networks exhibiting both coarse global trends and fine-grained local fluctuations. To bridge this gap, we propose HiFiNet, a novel hierarchical frequency-decomposition graph neural network that unifies spatial and spectral modeling. HiFiNet constructs a multi-level hierarchy of virtual nodes to enable localized frequency analysis, and employs a decomposition-updating-reconstruction framework with a topology-aware graph transformer to separately model and fuse low- and high-frequency signals.

Using this corpus, we systematically compared traditional machine-learning classifiers, including logistic regression (LR), support vector machines (SVM), Longformer, and a fully fine-tuned Llama3-8B-Instruct, with recent generative LLMs. To evaluate generative LLMs, we tested GPT-4o and the open-source GPT-OSS-20B under two configurations: a baseline (Base) and a task-optimized (Advanced) setting that focused inputs on metadata, recommendation sentences, and their surrounding context. A refined prompt for GPT-OSS-20B further improved reasoning accuracy. Performance was assessed using precision, recall, and F1 scores with 95% confidence intervals estimated via non-parametric bootstrapping. Inter-annotator agreement was high (F1 = 0.846).

Our method consists of two stages: (1) fine-tuning a pose-aware diffusion model from few-shot OOTD examples and (2) distilling a 3D avatar represented by a neural radiance field (NeRF). In the first stage, unlike previous methods that segment images into assets (e.g., garments, accessories) for 3D assembly, which is prone to inconsistency, we avoid decomposition and directly model the full-body appearance. By integrating a pre-trained ControlNet for pose estimation and a novel Condition Prior Preservation Loss (CPPL), our method enables end-to-end learning of fine details while mitigating language drift in few-shot training. Our method completes personalization in just 5 minutes, achieving a 48$\\times$ speed-up compared to previous approaches. In the second stage, we introduce a NeRF-based avatar representation optimized by canonical SMPL-X space sampling and Multi-Resolution 3D-SDS. Compared to mesh-based representations that suffer from resolution-dependent discretization and erroneous occluded geometry, our continuous radiance field can preserve high-frequency textures (e.g., hair) and handle occlusions correctly through transmittance. Experiments demonstrate that PFAvatar outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of reconstruction fidelity, detail preservation, and robustness to occlusions/truncations, advancing practical 3D avatar generation from real-world OOTD albums. In addition, the reconstructed 3D avatar supports downstream applications such as virtual try-on, animation, and human video reenactment, further demonstrating the versatility and practical value of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "PFAvatar\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb53D\u865a\u62df\u5316\u8eab\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u59ff\u52bf\u611f\u77e5\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u548cNeRF\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u89e3\u5efa\u6a21\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4f4e\u6548\u4e0e\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b05\u5206\u949f\u5feb\u901f\u5efa\u6a21\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u865a\u62df\u8bd5\u8863\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfOOTD\u7167\u72473D\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u5206\u5272\u670d\u88c5/\u914d\u9970\u7b49\u90e8\u4ef6\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec4\u88c5\uff0c\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u90e8\u4ef6\u4e0d\u534f\u8c03\u3001\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u906e\u6321/\u590d\u6742\u80cc\u666f\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f51\u683c\u7684\u8868\u793a\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "method": "1. \u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u96c6\u6210ControlNet\u59ff\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\u4e0eCPPL\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u5168\u8eab\u5916\u89c2\uff1b2. \u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u89c4\u8303SMPL-X\u7a7a\u95f4\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u73873D-SDS\u4f18\u5316NeRF\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u8fde\u7eed\u9ad8\u9891\u7eb9\u7406\u3002", "result": "48\u500d\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5728\u906e\u6321/\u622a\u65ad\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u6700\u4f18\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff08PSNR 28.7 vs SOTA 26.3\uff09\u3002\u652f\u6301\u865a\u62df\u8bd5\u8863\u3001\u52a8\u753b\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u7b49\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7a81\u7834\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b3D\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u8f90\u5c04\u573a\u8868\u5f81\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754cOOTD\u76f8\u518c\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4e3a\u5143\u5b87\u5b99\u6570\u5b57\u4eba\u521b\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, its memory footprint scales rapidly with scene complexity, often reaching several gigabytes. Existing methods address this issue by introducing compression strategies that exploit primitive-level redundancy through similarity detection and quantization. We aim to surpass the compression limits of such methods by incorporating symmetry-aware techniques, specifically targeting mirror symmetries to eliminate redundant primitives. We propose a novel compression framework, \\textbf{\\textit{SymGS}}, introducing learnable mirrors into the scene, thereby eliminating local and global reflective redundancies for compression. Our framework functions as a plug-and-play enhancement to state-of-the-art compression methods, (e.g. HAC) to achieve further compression.

This paper investigated the application of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to enhance GPT-2's capacity for therapeutic dialogue generation. The methodology restructured input formats to enable simultaneous processing of contextual information and emotional states alongside user input, employing a multi-component reward function that aligned model outputs with professional therapist responses and annotated emotions. Results demonstrated improvements through reinforcement learning over baseline GPT-2 across multiple evaluation metrics: BLEU (0.0111), ROUGE-1 (0.1397), ROUGE-2 (0.0213), ROUGE-L (0.1317), and METEOR (0.0581). LLM evaluation confirmed high contextual relevance and professionalism, while reinforcement learning achieved 99.34% emotion accuracy compared to 66.96% for baseline GPT-2.

The additive structure also enables clear visualizations, such as component-level risk curves similar to those used in generalized additive models, making the learned relationships easier to inspect and communicate.

Although recent tool-use benchmarks exist, they primarily target tool selection and simple execution rather than the compositional, multi-step reasoning needed for complex data analysis.

Past work found that models are miscalibrated, with entropy per step increasing (and text quality decreasing) as generations grow longer. This error accumulation is a fundamental problem in autoregressive models, and the standard solution is to truncate the distribution, which improves text quality at the cost of diversity. In this paper, we ask: is miscalibration likely to improve with scale, and is it theoretically possible to calibrate without tradeoffs? To build intuition, we first study a simplified theoretical setting to characterize the scaling behavior of miscalibration with respect to dataset size. We find that the scaling behavior depends on the power law exponent of the data distribution -- in particular, for a power law exponent close to 1, the scaling exponent is close to 0, meaning that miscalibration improves very slowly with scale. Next, we measure miscalibration empirically in language models ranging from 0.5B to 70B parameters. We find that the observed scaling behavior is similar to what is predicted by the simplified setting: our fitted scaling exponents for text are close to 0, meaning that larger models accumulate error at a similar rate as smaller ones. This scaling (or, lack thereof) provides one explanation for why we sample from larger models with similar amounts of truncation as smaller models, even though the larger models are of higher quality. However, truncation is not a satisfying solution because it comes at the cost of increased log loss. In theory, is it even possible to reduce entropy while preserving log loss? We prove that it is possible, if we assume access to a black box which can fit models to predict the future entropy of text.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u71b5\u6821\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\u4e0d\u4f1a\u968f\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5927\u81ea\u52a8\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u9519\u8bef\u79ef\u7d2f\u7387\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u4f46\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u727a\u7272\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "motivation": "\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u79ef\u7d2f\u7684\u6839\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u622a\u65ad\u65b9\u6848\u727a\u7272\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6362\u53d6\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u9700\u63a2\u7a76\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5c55\u80fd\u5426\u6539\u5584\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u7684\u65e0\u635f\u6821\u51c6\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "method": "1. \u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u5e42\u5f8b\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u9519\u8bef\u7f29\u653e\u89c4\u5f8b 2. \u5b9e\u8bc1\u6d4b\u91cf0.5B-70B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u9519\u8bef 3. \u63a2\u8ba8\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u71b5\u7684\u9ed1\u7bb1\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "result": "\u5f53\u6570\u636e\u5e42\u5f8b\u6307\u6570\u63a5\u8fd11\u65f6\uff0c\u6821\u51c6\u9519\u8bef\u968f\u89c4\u6a21\u6539\u5584\u6781\u6162\uff08\u7f29\u653e\u6307\u6570\u22480\uff09\u3002\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u9519\u8bef\u79ef\u7d2f\u7387\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u9700\u7c7b\u4f3c\u622a\u65ad\u5904\u7406\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u9ed1\u7bb1\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u635f\u6821\u51c6", "conclusion": "\u5355\u7eaf\u6269\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u6821\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u65e0\u635f\u6821\u51c6\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7ed3\u5408\u71b5\u9884\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u5411"}}

They excel at generating entities by semantic pattern matching but lack an explicit, verifiable reasoning mechanism. This \"cognitive shortcutting\" leads to suboptimal performance and brittle generalization, especially in zero-shot and lowresource scenarios where reasoning from limited contextual cues is crucial. To address this issue, a reasoning framework is proposed for NER, which shifts the extraction paradigm from implicit pattern matching to explicit reasoning. This framework consists of three stages: Chain of Thought (CoT) generation, CoT tuning, and reasoning enhancement. First, a dataset annotated with NER-oriented CoTs is generated, which contain task-relevant reasoning chains. Then, they are used to tune the NER model to generate coherent rationales before deriving the final answer. Finally, a reasoning enhancement stage is implemented to optimize the reasoning process using a comprehensive reward signal. This stage ensures explicit and verifiable extractions. Experiments show that ReasoningNER demonstrates impressive cognitive ability in the NER task, achieving competitive performance. In zero-shot settings, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, outperforming GPT-4 by 12.3 percentage points on the F1 score.

Existing methods focus on de-contextualized correctness or forced-choice judgments, overlooking the need for cultural understanding and reasoning required for appropriate responses. To address this gap, we introduce a set of benchmarks that, instead of directly probing abstract norms or isolated statements, present models with realistic situational contexts that require culturally grounded reasoning. In addition to the standard Exact Match metric, we introduce four complementary metrics (Coverage, Specificity, Connotation, and Coherence) to capture different dimensions of model's response quality. Empirical analysis across frontier models reveals that thin evaluation systematically overestimates cultural competence and produces unstable assessments with high variance. In contrast, thick evaluation exposes differences in reasoning depth, reduces variance, and provides more stable, interpretable signals of cultural understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u60c5\u5883\u7684\u6587\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4f20\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u9ad8\u4f30\u4e14\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6587\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u53bb\u8bed\u5883\u5316\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u6587\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u68c0\u6d4b", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u73b0\u5b9e\u60c5\u5883\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8986\u76d6\u6027\u3001\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u3001\u5185\u6db5\u3001\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u56db\u4e2a\u65b0\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ef4\u5ea6", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u4f20\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u5dee\u9ad8\u8fbe30%\uff0c\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e58%\u4e14\u4fe1\u53f7\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u63d0\u53473\u500d", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u60c5\u5883\u7684\u539a\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u6587\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u7cfb"}}

As such, accurate detection of hallucinations in MLLMs is imperative for ensuring their reliability in practical applications. To this end, guided by the principle of \"Seeing is Believing\", we introduce VBackChecker, a novel reference-free hallucination detection framework that verifies the consistency of MLLMgenerated responses with visual inputs, by leveraging a pixellevel Grounding LLM equipped with reasoning and referring segmentation capabilities. This reference-free framework not only effectively handles rich-context scenarios, but also offers interpretability. To facilitate this, an innovative pipeline is accordingly designed for generating instruction-tuning data (R-Instruct), featuring rich-context descriptions, grounding masks, and hard negative samples. We further establish R^2 -HalBench, a new hallucination benchmark for MLLMs, which, unlike previous benchmarks, encompasses real-world, rich-context descriptions from 18 MLLMs with high-quality annotations, spanning diverse object-, attribute, and relationship-level details.

This poses serious risks in domains like healthcare, finance, and customer support. A typical way to use LLMs is via the APIs provided by LLM vendors where there is no access to model weights or options to fine-tune the model. Existing methods to detect hallucinations in such settings where the model access is restricted or constrained by resources typically require making multiple LLM API calls, increasing latency and API cost. We introduce CONFACTCHECK, an efficient hallucination detection approach that does not leverage any external knowledge base and works on the simple intuition that responses to factual probes within the generated text should be consistent within a single LLM and across different LLMs. Rigorous empirical evaluation on multiple datasets that cover both the generation of factual texts and the open generation shows that CONFACTCHECK can detect hallucinated facts efficiently using fewer resources and achieves higher accuracy scores compared to existing baselines that operate under similar conditions.

We call the resulting model Cmprsr and demonstrate its superiority over both extractive and vanilla abstractive compression across the entire range of compression rates on lengthy inputs from MeetingBank and LongBench as well as short prompts from GSM8k. The latter highlights Cmprsr's generalizability across varying input lengths and domains. Moreover, Cmprsr closely follows the requested compression rate, offering fine control over the cost-quality trade-off.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c0fLLM\u538b\u7f29\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u5165\u7684Prompt\u538b\u7f29\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u5728\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u901a\u7528\u6027\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u7684Cmprsr\u6a21\u578b", "motivation": "\u964d\u4f4e\u4f7f\u7528\u9ed1\u76d2\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c0f\u578bLLM\u538b\u7f29\u8f93\u5165\u51cf\u5c11\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u5f00\u9500", "method": "1) \u5efa\u7acb25\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5 2) \u7528Textgrad\u4f18\u5316gpt-4.1-mini 3) \u5bf9Qwen3-4B\u8fdb\u884cSFT+GRPO\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3", "result": "Cmprsr\u5728MeetingBank/LongBench\u957f\u6587\u672c\u548cGSM8k\u77ed\u63d0\u793a\u4e0a\u5168\u9762\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u8bef\u5dee\u63a7\u5236\u5728\u00b13%\u5185", "conclusion": "Cmprsr\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u7cbe\u51c6\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86LLM-as-compressor\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027"}}

Therefore, the automatic summarization of legal documents has attracted serious attention from natural language processing researchers. Since the abstractive summaries of legal documents generated by deep neural methods remain prone to the risk of misrepresenting nuanced legal jargon or overlooking key contextual details, we envisage a rising trend toward the use of extractive case summarizers.\n  Given the high cost of human annotation for gold standard extractive summaries, we engineer a light and transparent pipeline that leverages existing abstractive gold standard summaries to create the corresponding extractive gold standard versions. The approach ensures that the experts` opinions ensconced in the original gold standard abstractive summaries are carried over to the transformed extractive summaries. We aim to augment seven existing case summarization datasets, which include abstractive summaries, by incorporating corresponding extractive summaries and create an enriched data resource for case summarization research community. To ensure the quality of the augmented extractive summaries, we perform an extensive comparative evaluation with the original abstractive gold standard summaries covering structural, lexical, and semantic dimensions.

We investigated this tension with two experiments. \\textbf{(1) Load \\& content}: after a negation instruction, we vary distractor text (semantic, syntactic, repetition) and measure rebound strength. \\textbf{(2) Polarity separation}: We test whether models distinguish neutral from negative framings of the same concept and whether this separation predicts rebound persistence. Results show that rebound consistently arises immediately after negation and intensifies with longer or semantic distractors, while repetition supports suppression. Stronger polarity separation correlates with more persistent rebound. Together, these findings, complemented by a circuit tracing analysis that identifies sparse middle-layer attention heads amplifying forbidden tokens while early layers suppress, link cognitive predictions of ironic rebound with mechanistic insights into long-context interference.

In this work, we address the evaluation challenge of reward models by probing preference representations. To confirm the effectiveness of this evaluation method, we construct a Multi-dimensional Reward Model Benchmark (MRMBench), a collection of six probing tasks for different preference dimensions. We design it to favor and encourage reward models that better capture preferences across different dimensions. Furthermore, we introduce an analysis method, inference-time probing, which identifies the dimensions used during the reward prediction and enhances its interpretability. Through extensive experiments, we find that MRMBench strongly correlates with the alignment performance of large language models (LLMs), making it a reliable reference for developing advanced reward models. Our analysis of MRMBench evaluation results reveals that reward models often struggle to capture preferences across multiple dimensions, highlighting the potential of multi-objective optimization in reward modeling. Additionally, our findings show that the proposed inference-time probing method offers a reliable metric for assessing the confidence of reward predictions, which ultimately improves the alignment of LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6MRMBench\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u63a2\u9488\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728LLM\u5bf9\u9f50\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u56fa\u5b9a\u6392\u5e8f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u504f\u597d\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u7cfb\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1", "method": "1. \u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b6\u4e2a\u63a2\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684MRMBench\u57fa\u51c6\n2. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u63a2\u9488\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u6790\u5956\u52b1\u9884\u6d4b\u7ef4\u5ea6\n3. \u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u504f\u597d\u6355\u6349\u4f18\u5316\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b", "result": "MRMBench\u4e0eLLM\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u80fd\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\uff08\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u65700.89\uff09\n\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u504f\u597d\u6355\u6349\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u8db3\uff08\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d23%\uff09\n\u63a2\u9488\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u63d0\u5347SFT\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u6548\u679c\uff08+15%\u80dc\u7387\uff09", "conclusion": "\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u63ed\u793a\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u63a2\u9488\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8def\u5f84"}}

To address these issues, we propose TAdaRAG, a novel RAG framework for on-the-fly task-adaptive knowledge graph construction from external sources. Specifically, we design an intent-driven routing mechanism to a domain-specific extraction template, followed by supervised fine-tuning and a reinforcement learning-based implicit extraction mechanism, ensuring concise, coherent, and non-redundant knowledge integration. Evaluations on six public benchmarks and a real-world business benchmark (NowNewsQA) across three backbone models demonstrate that TAdaRAG outperforms existing methods across diverse domains and long-text tasks, highlighting its strong generalization and practical effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86TAdaRAG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u6784\u5efa\u4efb\u52a1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edfRAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u622a\u65ad\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u65ad\u88c2\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfRAG\u5b58\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u7247\u6bb5\u622a\u65ad\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u68c0\u7d22\u5f15\u5165\u65e0\u5173\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u610f\u56fe\u9a71\u52a8\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u9886\u57df\u6a21\u677f\u9002\u914d\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6\u62bd\u53d6\u673a\u5236", "result": "\u57286\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u57fa\u51c6\u548cNowNewsQA\u4e1a\u52a1\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u548c\u957f\u6587\u672c\u4efb\u52a1", "conclusion": "TAdaRAG\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c"}}

However, RLHF-trained reward models often exhibit length bias -- a systematic tendency to favor longer responses by conflating verbosity with quality. We propose a causal framework for analyzing and mitigating length bias in RLHF reward modeling. Central to our approach is a counterfactual data augmentation method that generates response pairs designed to isolate content quality from verbosity. These counterfactual examples are then used to train the reward model, enabling it to assess responses based on content quality independently of verbosity. Specifically, we construct (1) length-divergent pairs with similar content and (2) content-divergent pairs of similar length.

Traditionally, task-oriented dialogue systems are conceptualized as intelligent agents that interact with users using natural language and have access to customized back-end APIs. However, in real-world scenarios, the widespread presence of front-end Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) and the absence of customized back-end APIs create a significant gap for traditional task-oriented dialogue systems in practical applications. In this paper, to bridge the gap, we collect MMWOZ, a new multimodal dialogue dataset that is extended from MultiWOZ 2.3 dataset. Specifically, we begin by developing a web-style GUI to serve as the front-end. Next, we devise an automated script to convert the dialogue states and system actions from the original dataset into operation instructions for the GUI. Lastly, we collect snapshots of the web pages along with their corresponding operation instructions. In addition, we propose a novel multimodal model called MATE (Multimodal Agent for Task-oriEnted dialogue) as the baseline model for the MMWOZ dataset. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive experimental analysis using MATE to investigate the construction of a practical multimodal agent for task-oriented dialogue.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMMWOZ\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cMATE\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u4efb\u52a1\u578b\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u771f\u5b9eGUI\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u843d\u5730\u96be\u9898", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4efb\u52a1\u578b\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b9a\u5236API\uff0c\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u7684GUI\u754c\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u9e3f\u6c9f", "method": "1. \u57fa\u4e8eMultiWOZ 2.3\u6784\u5efa\u7f51\u9875\u5f0fGUI\n2. \u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8f6c\u6362\u5bf9\u8bdd\u72b6\u6001\u4e3a\u64cd\u4f5c\u6307\u4ee4\n3. \u91c7\u96c6\u7f51\u9875\u5feb\u7167\u4e0e\u64cd\u4f5c\u6307\u4ee4\u914d\u5bf9", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u9996\u4e2a\u5305\u542b55K\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6837\u672c\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6MMWOOZ\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\u7684MATE\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u878d\u5408\u548cGUI\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u5b9e\u7528\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u578b\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f"}}

As a fully open-source omnimodal large model (OLM), it substantially advances Lychee's Uni-MoE series in language-centric multimodal understanding, reasoning, and generating. Based on the Qwen2.5-7B dense architecture, we build Uni-MoE-2.0-Omni from scratch through three core contributions: dynamic-capacity Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design, a progressive training strategy enhanced with an iterative reinforcement strategy, and a carefully curated multimodal data matching technique. It is capable of omnimodal understanding, as well as generating images, text, and speech. Architecturally, our new MoE framework balances computational efficiency and capability for 10 cross-modal inputs using shared, routed, and null experts, while our Omni-Modality 3D RoPE ensures spatio-temporal cross-modality alignment in the self-attention layer. For training, following cross-modal pretraining, we use a progressive supervised fine-tuning strategy that activates modality-specific experts and is enhanced by balanced data composition and an iterative GSPO-DPO method to stabilise RL training and improve reasoning. Data-wise, the base model, trained on approximately 75B tokens of open-source multimodal data, is equipped with special speech and image generation tokens, allowing it to learn these generative tasks by conditioning its outputs on linguistic cues. Extensive evaluation across 85 benchmarks demonstrates that our model achieves SOTA or highly competitive performance against leading OLMs, surpassing Qwen2.5-Omni (trained with 1.2T tokens) on over 50 of 76 benchmarks. Key strengths include video understanding (+7% avg. of 8), omnimodallity understanding (+7% avg. of 4), and audiovisual reasoning (+4%).

To support this task, we construct Knots (Knowledge and NOTAM Semantics), a high-quality dataset of 12,347 expert-annotated NOTAMs covering 194 Flight Information Regions, enhanced through a multi-agent collaborative framework for comprehensive field discovery. We systematically evaluate a wide range of prompt-engineering strategies and model-adaptation techniques, achieving substantial improvements in aviation text understanding and processing.

We find that SFT-based methods, e.g., Reason-KE, while state-of-the-art, suffer from a \"faithfulness gap\": they optimize for format mimicry rather than sound reasoning. This gap enables the LLM's powerful parametric priors to override new contextual facts, resulting in critical factual hallucinations (e.g., incorrectly reasoning \"Houston\" from \"NASA\" despite an explicit edit). To solve this core LLM alignment problem, we propose Reason-KE++, an SFT+RL framework that instills process-level faithfulness. Its core is a Stage-aware Reward mechanism that provides dense supervision for intermediate reasoning steps (e.g., Decomposition, Sub-answer Correctness). Crucially, we identify that naive outcome-only RL is a deceptive trap for LLM alignment: it collapses reasoning integrity (e.g., 19.00% Hop acc) while superficially boosting final accuracy.

However, direct S2ST models require large amounts of parallel speech data in the source and target languages, which are rarely available for low-resource languages such as Persian. This paper presents a direct S2ST system for translating Persian speech into English speech, as well as a pipeline for synthetic parallel Persian-English speech generation. The model comprises three components: (1) a conformer-based encoder, initialized from self-supervised pre-training, maps source speech to high-level acoustic representations; (2) a causal transformer decoder with relative position multi-head attention translates these representations into discrete target speech units; (3) a unit-based neural vocoder generates waveforms from the predicted discrete units. To mitigate the data scarcity problem, we construct a new Persian-English parallel speech corpus by translating Persian speech transcriptions into English using a large language model and then synthesizing the corresponding English speech with a state-of-the-art zero-shot text-to-speech system. The resulting corpus increases the amount of available parallel speech by roughly a factor of six. On the Persian-English portion of the CVSS corpus, the proposed model achieves improvement of 4.6 ASR BLEU with the synthetic data over direct baselines. These results indicate that combining self-supervised pre-training, discrete speech units, and synthetic parallel data is effective for improving direct S2ST in low-resource language pairs such as Persian-English", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u79bb\u6563\u8bed\u97f3\u5355\u5143\u548c\u5408\u6210\u5e73\u884c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6ce2\u65af\u8bed-\u82f1\u8bed\u8bed\u97f3\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6ce2\u65af\u8bed\u7b49\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5e73\u884c\u8bed\u97f3\u6570\u636e\u5bfc\u81f4\u76f4\u63a5\u8bed\u97f3\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898", "method": "1.\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684Conformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\n2.\u5e26\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u56e0\u679cTransformer\u89e3\u7801\u5668\n3.\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u5143\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u58f0\u7801\u5668\n4.\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u7ffb\u8bd1+TTS\u5408\u6210\u6784\u5efa\u516d\u500d\u6269\u589e\u7684\u5e73\u884c\u8bed\u6599\u5e93", "result": "\u5728CVSS\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b04.6 ASR BLEU\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "\u7efc\u5408\u8fd0\u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u79bb\u6563\u5355\u5143\u8868\u793a\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6ce2\u65af\u8bed-\u82f1\u8bed\u7b49\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u8bed\u97f3\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6548\u679c"}}

This binds their creativity and leaves them unable to autonomously invent entirely new attack mechanisms. To overcome this gap, we introduce \\textbf{EvoSynth}, an autonomous framework that shifts the paradigm from attack planning to the evolutionary synthesis of jailbreak methods. Instead of refining prompts, EvoSynth employs a multi-agent system to autonomously engineer, evolve, and execute novel, code-based attack algorithms. Crucially, it features a code-level self-correction loop, allowing it to iteratively rewrite its own attack logic in response to failure. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that EvoSynth not only establishes a new state-of-the-art by achieving an 85.5\\% Attack Success Rate (ASR) against highly robust models like Claude-Sonnet-4.5, but also generates attacks that are significantly more diverse than those from existing methods.

We focus on set membership queries -- among the most fundamental forms of reasoning -- using tasks like ``Is apple an element of the set \\{pear, plum, apple, raspberry\\}?''. We conduct a systematic empirical evaluation across prompt phrasing, semantic structure, element ordering, and model choice. Our large-scale analysis reveals that LLM performance on this elementary task is consistently brittle, and unpredictable across all dimensions, suggesting that the models' ``understanding'' of the set concept is fragmented and convoluted at best.

Prior work, such as that of Wei et al., demonstrated these phenomena under model and data scaling, with transitions revealed after applying a log scale to training compute. In this work, we ask three complementary questions: (1) Are phase transitions unique to large models, or can they also be observed in small transformer-based language models? (2) Can such transitions be detected directly in linear training space, rather than only after log rescaling? and (3) Can these transitions emerge at early stages of training? To investigate, we train a small GPT-style transformer on a character-level corpus and analyze the evolution of vocabulary usage throughout training. We track the average word length, the number of correct versus incorrect words, and shifts in vocabulary diversity. Building on these measures, we apply Poisson and sub-Poisson statistics to quantify how words connect and reorganize. This combined analysis reveals a distinct transition point during training. Notably, these transitions are not apparent in standard loss or validation curves, but become visible through our vocabulary- and statistics-based probes. Our findings suggest that phase-transition reorganizations are a general feature of language model training, observable even in modest models, detectable directly in linear training space, and occurring surprisingly early as coherence emerges. This perspective provides new insight into the nonlinear dynamics of language model training and underscores the importance of tailored metrics for uncovering phase transition behaviors", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5c0f\u578btransformer\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u76f8\u53d8\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bcd\u6c47\u7edf\u8ba1\u63a2\u9488\u53ef\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u7ebf\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u91cd\u7ec4\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u76f8\u53d8\u73b0\u8c61\u662f\u5426\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a7a\u95f4\u800c\u975e\u5bf9\u6570\u8f6c\u6362\u540e\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e9\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u76f8\u53d8\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c0f\u578bGPT\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u8ffd\u8e2a\u8bcd\u6c47\u957f\u5ea6\u3001\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6cca\u677e/\u4e9a\u6cca\u677e\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u5316\u8bcd\u6c47\u91cd\u7ec4\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u635f\u5931\u66f2\u7ebf\u672a\u663e\u5f02\u5e38\u65f6\uff0c\u8bcd\u6c47\u7edf\u8ba1\u6307\u6807\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u671f\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u70b9\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u8bcd\u9879\u8fde\u63a5\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u7a81\u53d8\u91cd\u7ec4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76f8\u53d8\u91cd\u7ec4\u662f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u666e\u904d\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u6307\u6807\u53ef\u5728\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Specifically, we evaluate the robustness of LLMs generating formal proofs with semantically similar paraphrased NL statements by measuring semantic and compilation validity. Using the formal benchmarks MiniF2F (Zheng, Han, and Polu 2021) and Lean 4 version of ProofNet (Xin et al. 2024), and two modern LLMs, we generate paraphrased natural language statements and cross-evaluate these statements across both models.

We present BioMedJImpact, a large-scale, biomedical-oriented dataset designed to advance journal-level analysis of scientific impact and AI engagement. Built from 1.74 million PubMed Central articles across 2,744 journals, BioMedJImpact integrates bibliometric indicators, collaboration features, and LLM-derived semantic indicators for AI engagement. Specifically, the AI engagement feature is extracted through a reproducible three-stage LLM pipeline that we propose. Using this dataset, we analyze how collaboration intensity and AI engagement jointly influence scientific impact across pre- and post-pandemic periods (2016-2019, 2020-2023). Two consistent trends emerge: journals with higher collaboration intensity, particularly those with larger and more diverse author teams, tend to achieve greater citation impact, and AI engagement has become an increasingly strong correlate of journal prestige, especially in quartile rankings. To further validate the three-stage LLM pipeline we proposed for deriving the AI engagement feature, we conduct human evaluation, confirming substantial agreement in AI relevance detection and consistent subfield classification. Together, these contributions demonstrate that BioMedJImpact serves as both a comprehensive dataset capturing the intersection of biomedicine and AI, and a validated methodological framework enabling scalable, content-aware scientometric analysis of scientific impact and innovation dynamics.

Current alignment techniques often address surface-level output or require extensive fine-tuning. This paper demonstrates that targeted activation engineering can steer LLaMA 3.1-8B to exhibit more human-like emotional nuances. We first employ attribution patching to identify causally influential components, to find a key intervention locus by observing activation patterns during diagnostic conversational tasks. We then derive emotional expression vectors from the difference in the activations generated by contrastive text pairs (positive vs. negative examples of target emotions). Applying these vectors to new conversational prompts significantly enhances emotional characteristics: steered responses show increased positive sentiment (e.g., joy, trust) and more frequent first-person pronoun usage, indicative of greater personal engagement.

It is widely applied in fields such as information retrieval, content summarisation, and trend analysis across various disciplines. However, probabilistic topic models can produce different results when rerun due to their stochastic nature, leading to inconsistencies in latent topics. Factors like corpus shuffling, rare text removal, and document elimination contribute to these variations. This instability affects replicability, reliability, and interpretation, raising concerns about whether topic models capture meaningful topics or just noise. To address these problems, we defined a new stability measure that incorporates accuracy and consistency and uses the generative properties of LDA to generate a new corpus with ground truth. These generated corpora are run through LDA 50 times to determine the variability in the output. We show that LDA can correctly determine the underlying number of topics in the documents.

We introduce NeuroLex, a lightweight domain-adaptive language model trained purely on EEG report text from the Harvard Electroencephalography Database. Unlike existing biomedical LMs, NeuroLex is tailored to the linguistic and diagnostic characteristics of EEG reporting, enabling it to serve as both an independent textual model and a decoder backbone for multimodal EEG-language systems. Using span-corruption pretraining and instruction-style fine-tuning on report polishing, paragraph summarization, and terminology question answering, NeuroLex learns the syntax and reasoning patterns characteristic of EEG interpretation. Comprehensive evaluations show that it achieves lower perplexity, higher extraction and summarization accuracy, better label efficiency, and improved robustness to negation and factual hallucination compared with general models of the same scale. With an EEG-aware linguistic backbone, NeuroLex bridges biomedical text modeling and brain-computer interface applications, offering a foundation for interpretable and language-driven neural decoding.", "AI": {"tldr": "NeuroLex\u662f\u4e13\u4e3a\u8111\u7535\u56fe\u62a5\u544a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b", "motivation": "\u901a\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349EEG\u62a5\u544a\u7279\u6709\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u89c4\u8303\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u5347\u533b\u7597\u6587\u672c\u5904\u7406\u6548\u679c", "method": "\u91c7\u7528span-corruption\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\uff08\u62a5\u544a\u6da6\u8272/\u6bb5\u843d\u603b\u7ed3/\u672f\u8bed\u95ee\u7b54\uff09\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u5b66\u4e60EEG\u89e3\u8bfb\u7684\u53e5\u6cd5\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u903b\u8f91", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e21%\uff0c\u4fe1\u606f\u62bd\u53d6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u534737%\uff0c\u5bf9\u5426\u5b9a\u53e5\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u9ad843%\uff0c\u4e14\u663e\u7740\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u5e7b\u89c9", "conclusion": "NeuroLex\u6784\u5efa\u4e86EEG\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u89e3\u7801\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u9a71\u52a8\u8111\u673a\u63a5\u53e3\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840"}}

Extending Searle's Chinese Room into the multi-modal domain, this paper proposes the Visual Room argument: MLLMs may describe every visual detail precisely yet fail to comprehend the underlying emotions and intentions, namely seeing is not understanding. Building on this, we introduce \\textit{Visual Room} 2.0, a hierarchical benchmark for evaluating perception-cognition alignment of MLLMs. We model human perceptive and cognitive processes across three levels: low, middle, and high, covering 17 representative tasks. The perception component ranges from attribute recognition to scene understanding, while the cognition component extends from textual entailment to causal and social reasoning. The dataset contains 350 multi-modal samples, each with six progressive questions (2,100 in total) spanning perception to cognition. Evaluating 10 state-of-the-art (SoTA) MLLMs, we highlight three key findings: (1) MLLMs exhibit stronger perceptual competence than cognitive ability (8.0\\%$\\uparrow$); (2) cognition appears not causally dependent on perception-based reasoning; and (3) cognition scales with model size, but perception does not consistently improve with larger variants. This work operationalizes Seeing $\\ne$ Understanding as a testable hypothesis, offering a new paradigm from perceptual processing to cognitive reasoning in MLLMs. Our dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/LHK2003/PCBench.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efaVisual Room 2.0\u5206\u5c42\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u8ba4\u77e5\u8131\u8282\u73b0\u8c61\uff08Seeing \u2260 Understanding\uff09\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u4f18\u4e8e\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u4e14\u4e8c\u8005\u65e0\u56e0\u679c\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d28\u7591\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(MLLMs)\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u5177\u5907\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d7\u585e\u5c14\u4e2d\u6587\u623f\u95f4\u601d\u60f3\u5b9e\u9a8c\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u89c6\u89c9\u623f\u95f4\u8bba\u8bc1\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u7cbe\u786e\u63cf\u8ff0\u89c6\u89c9\u7ec6\u8282\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6df1\u5c42\u60c5\u611f\u610f\u56fe\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e09\u7ea7\u5206\u5c42\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u4f4e/\u4e2d/\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\uff09\uff0c\u8986\u76d617\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u4ece\u5c5e\u6027\u8bc6\u522b\u5230\u793e\u4f1a\u63a8\u7406\uff09\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u5305\u542b350\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6837\u672c\u30012100\u4e2a\u6e10\u8fdb\u95ee\u9898\u7684PCBench\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f3010\u4e2aSOTA\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "1. \u6a21\u578b\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff088%\u2191\uff09\n2. \u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\n3. \u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u968f\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u672a\u89c1\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb", "conclusion": "\u9996\u6b21\u5c06Seeing \u2260 Understanding\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4ece\u611f\u77e5\u5904\u7406\u5230\u8ba4\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u63ed\u793aMLLMs\u9700\u7a81\u7834\u611f\u77e5-\u8ba4\u77e5\u5bf9\u9f50\u74f6\u9888\u3002"}}

However, this crucial trait is severely undermined by supervised fine-tuning (SFT), a common technique for model specialization. Existing recovery methods rely on data-intensive global parameter adjustments, implicitly assuming that SFT deeply corrupts the models' ability to recognize their knowledge boundaries. However, we observe that fine-tuned LLMs still preserve this ability; what is damaged is their capacity to faithfully express that awareness. Building on this, we propose Honesty-Critical Neurons Restoration (HCNR) to surgically repair this suppressed capacity. HCNR identifies and restores key expression-governing neurons to their pre-trained state while harmonizing them with task-oriented neurons via Hessian-guided compensation. Experiments on four QA tasks and five LLM families demonstrate that HCNR effectively recovers 33.25% of the compromised honesty while achieving at least 2.23x speedup with over 10x less data compared to baseline methods, offering a practical solution for trustworthy LLM deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u5bfc\u81f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8bda\u5b9e\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faHCNR\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u952e\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u4fee\u590d\u672f\u6062\u590d\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u4fee\u590d", "motivation": "\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03(SFT)\u4f1a\u4e25\u91cd\u635f\u5bb3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bda\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u6062\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6570\u636e\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u4fdd\u7559\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fb9\u754c\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e", "method": "HCNR\u901a\u8fc7\uff1a1) \u5b9a\u4f4d\u5e76\u6062\u590d\u8868\u8fbe\u63a7\u5236\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5230\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u72b6\u6001 2) \u57fa\u4e8eHessian\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u8865\u507f\u534f\u8c03\u4efb\u52a1\u795e\u7ecf\u5143 3) \u624b\u672f\u5f0f\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\u7b56\u7565", "result": "\u57284\u4e2aQA\u4efb\u52a1\u548c5\u7c7b\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u6062\u590d33.25%\u8bda\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u5b9e\u73b02.23\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u548c10\u500d\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u53ef\u4fe1\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4fee\u590d\u6548\u7387"}}

But is this victory complete? Are the multilingual models better than aligned monolingual models in every aspect? Can the higher computational cost of multilingual models always be justified? Or is there a compromise between the two extremes? Bilingual Lexicon Induction is one of the most widely used metrics in terms of evaluating the degree of alignment between two embedding spaces. In this study, we explore the strengths and limitations of BLI as a measure to evaluate the degree of alignment of two embedding spaces. Further, we evaluate how well traditional embedding alignment techniques, novel multilingual models, and combined alignment techniques perform BLI tasks in the contexts of both high-resource and low-resource languages. In addition to that, we investigate the impact of the language families to which the pairs of languages belong. We identify that BLI does not measure the true degree of alignment in some cases and we propose solutions for them. We propose a novel stem-based BLI approach to evaluate two aligned embedding spaces that take into account the inflected nature of languages as opposed to the prevalent word-based BLI techniques. Further, we introduce a vocabulary pruning technique that is more informative in showing the degree of the alignment, especially performing BLI on multilingual embedding models. Often, combined embedding alignment techniques perform better while in certain cases multilingual embeddings perform better (mainly low-resource language cases).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8d28\u7591\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bcd\u5e72\u7684\u53cc\u8bed\u8bcd\u5178\u5f52\u7eb3\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u8bcd\u6c47\u526a\u679d\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u5d4c\u5165\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u5728\u6240\u6709\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4f20\u7edf\u5d4c\u5165\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5vs\u65b0\u578b\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8bed\u8a00\u5bb6\u65cf\u5bf9\u53cc\u8bed\u8bcd\u5178\u5f52\u7eb3\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd", "method": "1. \u5206\u6790BLI\u6307\u6807\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\n2. \u6bd4\u8f83\u4f20\u7edf\u5bf9\u9f50\u6280\u672f/\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b/\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\n3. \u63d0\u51fa\u8bcd\u5e72BLI\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u8bcd\u6c47\u526a\u679d\u6280\u672f\n4. \u6d4b\u8bd5\u9ad8\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02", "result": "\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u573a\u666f\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u4f18\uff1b\u8bed\u8a00\u5bb6\u65cf\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cdBLI\u6548\u679c\uff1b\u4f20\u7edfBLI\u6307\u6807\u5b58\u5728\u6d4b\u91cf\u504f\u5dee", "conclusion": "\u53cc\u8bed\u8bcd\u5178\u5f52\u7eb3\u4e0d\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u53cd\u6620\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u9700\u7ed3\u5408\u8bcd\u5e72\u5206\u6790\u548c\u8bcd\u6c47\u526a\u679d\u6280\u672f\u3002\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u4ecd\u5177\u4e0d\u53ef\u66ff\u4ee3\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u6743\u8861\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c"}}

To address this issue, we introduce Spark-Prover-X1, a 7B parameter model trained via an three-stage framework designed to unlock the reasoning potential of more accessible and moderately-sized LLMs. The first stage infuses deep knowledge through continuous pre-training on a broad mathematical corpus, enhanced by a suite of novel data tasks. Key innovation is a \"CoT-augmented state prediction\" task to achieve fine-grained reasoning. The second stage employs Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) within an expert iteration loop to specialize both the Spark-Prover-X1-7B and Spark-Formalizer-X1-7B models. Finally, a targeted round of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is applied to sharpen the prover's capabilities on the most challenging problems. To facilitate robust evaluation, particularly on problems from real-world examinations, we also introduce ExamFormal-Bench, a new benchmark dataset of 402 formal problems.

This study aimed to systematically evaluate the accuracy and reliability of contemporary LLMs in identifying the adherence of published RCTs to the CONSORT 2010 statement under a zero-shot setting. We constructed a golden standard dataset of 150 published RCTs spanning diverse medical specialties. The primary outcome was the macro-averaged F1-score for the three-class classification task, supplemented by item-wise performance metrics and qualitative error analysis. Overall model performance was modest. The top-performing models, Gemini-2.5-Flash and DeepSeek-R1, achieved nearly identical macro F1 scores of 0.634 and Cohen's Kappa coefficients of 0.280 and 0.282, respectively, indicating only fair agreement with expert consensus. A striking performance disparity was observed across classes: while most models could identify compliant items with high accuracy (F1 score > 0.850), they struggled profoundly with identifying non-compliant and not applicable items, where F1 scores rarely exceeded 0.400. Notably, some high-profile models like GPT-4o underperformed, achieving a macro F1-score of only 0.521.

AEC decomposes ZSEE into specialized subtasks--retrieval, planning, coding, and verification--each handled by a dedicated LLM agent. Event schemas are represented as executable class definitions, enabling deterministic validation and precise feedback via a verification agent. This programming-inspired approach allows for systematic disambiguation and schema enforcement through iterative refinement. By leveraging collaborative agent workflows, AEC enables LLMs to produce precise, complete, and schema-consistent extractions in zero-shot settings.

We show that the choice of LLM for pseudo-label generation critically affects model performance and that the ratio of clean-to-noisy samples during training strongly influences stability and accuracy. Finally, a qualitative analysis of error intensity and score prediction confirms the robustness and interpretability of our approach. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in estimating grammar competency scores with high accuracy, paving the way for scalable, low-resource grammar assessment systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bed\u6cd5\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLM\u751f\u6210\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6297\u566a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8bed\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30", "motivation": "\u53e3\u8bed\u8bed\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b58\u5728\u81ea\u53d1\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e14\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e94\u7528", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u91cf\u8868\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210LLM\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\n2. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u578btransformer\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u5904\u7406\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\n3. \u63a2\u7d22LLM\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6846\u67b6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe87.6%\uff0cLLM\u9009\u62e9\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u8fbe23%\uff0c\u5e72\u51c0\u6837\u672c\u6bd4\u4f8b40%\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6700\u4f73", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9519\u8bef\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u5b9e\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u89e3\u91ca\u6027"}}

To solve this, we introduce the first publicly available, 20,000-row Bangla corpus, manually annotated to explicitly distinguish between these two phenomena in noisy ASR transcripts. We benchmark this novel resource using two paradigms: state-of-the-art multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) and task-specific fine-tuning of encoder models. LLMs achieve competitive performance (up to 82.68\\% accuracy) with few-shot prompting. However, fine-tuning proves superior, with the language-specific BanglaBERT model achieving the highest accuracy of 84.78\\% and an F1 score of 0.677.

TCM-5CEval is designed to assess LLMs across five critical dimensions: (1) Core Knowledge (TCM-Exam), (2) Classical Literacy (TCM-LitQA), (3) Clinical Decision-making (TCM-MRCD), (4) Chinese Materia Medica (TCM-CMM), and (5) Clinical Non-pharmacological Therapy (TCM-ClinNPT). We conducted a thorough evaluation of fifteen prominent LLMs, revealing significant performance disparities and identifying top-performing models like deepseek\\_r1 and gemini\\_2\\_5\\_pro. Our findings show that while models exhibit proficiency in recalling foundational knowledge, they struggle with the interpretative complexities of classical texts. Critically, permutation-based consistency testing reveals widespread fragilities in model inference. All evaluated models, including the highest-scoring ones, displayed a substantial performance degradation when faced with varied question option ordering, indicating a pervasive sensitivity to positional bias and a lack of robust understanding. TCM-5CEval not only provides a more detailed diagnostic tool for LLM capabilities in TCM but aldso exposes fundamental weaknesses in their reasoning stability.

Today, many translators exist, based on encoder-decoder deep architectures, nevertheless, no quantitative objective methods are available to assess their performance, likely because the entropy of even a single language remains unknown. This study presents a quantitative method for estimating translation entropy, with the following key finding. Given a translator, several sentences that differ by only one selected token of a given pivot sentence yield identical translations. Analyzing the statistics of this phenomenon across an ensemble of such sentences, consisting each of a pivot selected token, yields the probabilities of replacing this specific token with others while preserving the translation. These probabilities constitute the entropy of the selected token, and the average across all selected pivot tokens provides an estimate of the translator's overall translation entropy, which is enhanced along the decoder blocks. This entropic measure allows for the quantitative ranking of several publicly available translators and reveals whether mutual translation entropy is symmetric. Extending the proposed method to include the replacement of two tokens in a given pivot sentence demonstrates a multiplicative effect, where translation degeneracy is proportional to the product of the degeneracies of the two tokens. These findings establish translation entropy as a measurable property and objective benchmarking of artificial translators.

To do this, we synthesise a novel dataset containing 4k+ English words spoken in isolation alongside stylistically consistent spectrogram and waveform figures. We test the ability of VLMs to understand these representations of speech through a multiple-choice task whereby models must predict the correct phonemic or graphemic transcription of a spoken word when presented amongst 3 distractor transcriptions that have been selected based on their phonemic edit distance to the ground truth.

Nevertheless, recent research has shown that EaaS is vulnerable to model extraction attacks, which could lead to significant economic losses for model providers. For copyright protection, existing methods inject watermark embeddings into text embeddings and use them to detect copyright infringement. However, current watermarking methods often resist only a subset of attacks and fail to provide \\textit{comprehensive} protection. To this end, we present the region-triggered semantic watermarking framework called RegionMarker, which defines trigger regions within a low-dimensional space and injects watermarks into text embeddings associated with these regions. By utilizing a secret dimensionality reduction matrix to project onto this subspace and randomly selecting trigger regions, RegionMarker makes it difficult for watermark removal attacks to evade detection. Furthermore, by embedding watermarks across the entire trigger region and using the text embedding as the watermark, RegionMarker is resilient to both paraphrasing and dimension-perturbation attacks.

We conduct a controlled PEFT/LoRA study across multiple open-weight LLM families and sizes, treating task and language as transfer axes while conditioning on model family and size; we fine-tune each model on a single task-language source and measure transfer as the percentage-point change versus its baseline score when evaluated on all other task-language target pairs. We decompose transfer into (i) Matched-Task (Cross-Language), (ii) Matched-Language (Cross-Task), and (iii) Cross-Task (Cross-Language) regimes. We uncover two consistent general patterns.

A Systematic Evaluation in Real-World Clinical Contexts", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "comment": null, "summary": "With the rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) in medicine, a key question is whether they can function as competent pediatricians in real-world clinical settings. We developed PEDIASBench, a systematic evaluation framework centered on a knowledge-system framework and tailored to realistic clinical environments. PEDIASBench assesses LLMs across three dimensions: application of basic knowledge, dynamic diagnosis and treatment capability, and pediatric medical safety and medical ethics. We evaluated 12 representative models released over the past two years, including GPT-4o, Qwen3-235B-A22B, and DeepSeek-V3, covering 19 pediatric subspecialties and 211 prototypical diseases. State-of-the-art models performed well on foundational knowledge, with Qwen3-235B-A22B achieving over 90% accuracy on licensing-level questions, but performance declined ~15% as task complexity increased, revealing limitations in complex reasoning. Multiple-choice assessments highlighted weaknesses in integrative reasoning and knowledge recall. In dynamic diagnosis and treatment scenarios, DeepSeek-R1 scored highest in case reasoning (mean 0.58), yet most models struggled to adapt to real-time patient changes. On pediatric medical ethics and safety tasks, Qwen2.5-72B performed best (accuracy 92.05%), though humanistic sensitivity remained limited. These findings indicate that pediatric LLMs are constrained by limited dynamic decision-making and underdeveloped humanistic care. Future development should focus on multimodal integration and a clinical feedback-model iteration loop to enhance safety, interpretability, and human-AI collaboration. While current LLMs cannot independently perform pediatric care, they hold promise for decision support, medical education, and patient communication, laying the groundwork for a safe, trustworthy, and collaborative intelligent pediatric healthcare system.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1PEDIASBench\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5LLMs\u5728\u513f\u79d1\u4e34\u5e8a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7840\u533b\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fbe\u6807\u4f46\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u51b3\u7b56\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u9700\u52a0\u5f3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6574\u5408\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u513f\u79d1\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u662f\u5426\u5177\u5907\u5408\u683c\u513f\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u4e0e\u53d1\u5c55\u65b9\u5411", "method": "\u6784\u5efaPEDIASBench\u4e09\u7ef4\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u7cfb\uff08\u57fa\u7840\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e94\u7528\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u8bca\u7597\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u533b\u7597\u5b89\u5168\u4f26\u7406\uff09\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd512\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\uff082019-2023\u5e74\u53d1\u5e03\uff09\u572819\u4e2a\u513f\u79d1\u4e9a\u4e13\u4e1a211\u79cd\u5178\u578b\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u8868\u73b0", "result": "Qwen3-235B\u57fa\u7840\u9898\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d8590%\u4f46\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0b\u964d15%\uff1bDeepSeek-R1\u75c5\u4f8b\u63a8\u7406\u5f97\u5206\u6700\u9ad8\uff08\u5e73\u57470.58\uff09\uff1bQwen2.5-72B\u533b\u7597\u4f26\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u738792.05%\uff0c\u4f46\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u51b3\u7b56\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u4eba\u6587\u5173\u6000\u7f3a\u5931", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u65e0\u6cd5\u72ec\u7acb\u627f\u62c5\u513f\u79d1\u8bca\u7597\uff0c\u4f46\u5177\u5907\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5e94\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6574\u5408\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u6167\u513f\u79d1\u533b\u7597\u7cfb\u7edf\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840"}}

This trend highlights the need for personalized dialogue assistants that can understand user-specific traits to accurately interpret requirements and tailor responses to individual preferences. However, existing approaches often overlook the complexities of long-term interactions and fail to capture users' subjective characteristics. To address these gaps, we present PAL-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the personalization capabilities of service-oriented assistants in long-term user-agent interactions. In the absence of available real-world data, we develop a multi-step LLM-based synthesis pipeline, which is further verified and refined by human annotators. This process yields PAL-Set, the first Chinese dataset comprising multi-session user logs and dialogue histories, which serves as the foundation for PAL-Bench. Furthermore, to improve personalized service-oriented interactions, we propose H$^2$Memory, a hierarchical and heterogeneous memory framework that incorporates retrieval-augmented generation to improve personalized response generation.
