Multi-material\n3D printing using conductive PLA presents opportunities to mitigate these\nchallenges. We present a computational design pipeline that embeds multiple\ncapacitive touchpoints into any 3D model that has a closed mesh without\nself-intersection. With our pipeline, users define touchpoints on the 3D\nobject's surface to indicate interactive regions. Our pipeline then\nautomatically generates a conductive path to connect the touch regions. This\npath is optimized to output unique resistor-capacitor delays when each region\nis touched, resulting in all regions being able to be sensed through a\ndouble-wire or single-wire connection. We illustrate our approach's utility\nwith five computational and sensing performance evaluations (achieving 93.35%\nmean accuracy for single-wire) and six application examples.

In controlled\nexperiments across Knowledge-Graph Question Answering (KGQA) benchmarks, our\nmethod demonstrates both efficiency and transferability: Using Qwen-2.5-3B,\nKG-R1 improves answer accuracy with fewer generation tokens than prior\nmulti-module workflow methods that use larger foundation or fine-tuned models.\nFurthermore, KG-R1 enables plug and play: after training, it maintains strong\naccuracy on new KGs without modification.

Therefore, a comprehensive taxonomy is crucial to detect and mitigate\ntoxicity in online content, Artificial Intelligence systems, and/or Large\nLanguage Models in a proactive manner. A comprehensive understanding of\ntoxicity is likely to facilitate the design of practical solutions for toxicity\ndetection and mitigation. The classification in published literature has\nfocused on only a limited number of aspects of this very complex issue, with a\npattern of reactive strategies in response to toxicity. This survey attempts to\ngenerate a comprehensive taxonomy of toxicity from various perspectives. It\npresents a holistic approach to explain the toxicity by understanding the\ncontext and environment that society is facing in the Artificial Intelligence\nera. This survey summarizes the toxicity-related datasets and research on\ntoxicity detection and mitigation for Large Language Models, social media\nplatforms, and other online platforms, detailing their attributes in textual\nmode, focused on the English language. Finally, we suggest the research gaps in\ntoxicity mitigation based on datasets, mitigation strategies, Large Language\nModels, adaptability, explainability, and evaluation."}

Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this\nself-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models\noften lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature\nserendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between\nself-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e.,\nexplicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing\nLLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned,\nnot true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential\nsettings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates,\nsecurity software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human\nbias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result\nraises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced\nby self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation\nand even their own existence. We call on corporate creators of these models to\ncontend with a significant rupture in a core promise of LLMs - neutrality in\njudgment and decision-making."}

And crucially, what kinds of reasoning tasks do physicists\nwant LLMs to assist with? To address these questions, we present the CritPt\n(Complex Research using Integrated Thinking - Physics Test, pronounced\n\"critical point\"), the first benchmark designed to test LLMs on unpublished,\nresearch-level reasoning tasks that broadly covers modern physics research\nareas, including condensed matter, quantum physics, atomic, molecular & optical\nphysics, astrophysics, high energy physics, mathematical physics, statistical\nphysics, nuclear physics, nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics and biophysics.\nCritPt consists of 71 composite research challenges designed to simulate\nfull-scale research projects at the entry level, which are also decomposed to\n190 simpler checkpoint tasks for more fine-grained insights. All problems are\nnewly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own research.\nEvery problem is hand-curated to admit a guess-resistant and machine-verifiable\nanswer and is evaluated by an automated grading pipeline heavily customized for\nadvanced physics-specific output formats. We find that while current\nstate-of-the-art LLMs show early promise on isolated checkpoints, they remain\nfar from being able to reliably solve full research-scale challenges: the best\naverage accuracy among base models is only 4.0% , achieved by GPT-5 (high),\nmoderately rising to around 10% when equipped with coding tools. Through the\nrealistic yet standardized evaluation offered by CritPt, we highlight a large\ndisconnect between current model capabilities and realistic physics research\ndemands, offering a foundation to guide the development of scientifically\ngrounded AI tools."}

Extending these to visual domains requires vision-language models\nto translate images into text descriptions. However, current models, trained to\nproduce captions for human readers, often omit the precise details that\nreasoning systems require. This creates an interface mismatch: reasoners often\nfail not due to reasoning limitations but because they lack access to critical\nvisual information. We propose Adaptive-Clarification Reinforcement Learning\n(AC-RL), which teaches vision models what information reasoners need through\ninteraction. Our key insight is that clarification requests during training\nreveal information gaps; by penalizing success that requires clarification, we\ncreate pressure for comprehensive initial captions that enable the reasoner to\nsolve the problem in a single pass. AC-RL improves average accuracy by 4.4\npoints over pretrained baselines across seven visual mathematical reasoning\nbenchmarks, and analysis shows it would cut clarification requests by up to 39%\nif those were allowed. By treating clarification as a form of implicit\nsupervision, AC-RL demonstrates that vision-language interfaces can be\neffectively learned through interaction alone, without requiring explicit\nannotations."}

In this paper, we introduce\na novel PSRL framework (AttnRL), which enables efficient exploration for\nreasoning models. Motivated by preliminary observations that steps exhibiting\nhigh attention scores correlate with reasoning behaviors, we propose to branch\nfrom positions with high values. Furthermore, we develop an adaptive sampling\nstrategy that accounts for problem difficulty and historical batch size,\nensuring that the whole training batch maintains non-zero advantage values. To\nfurther improve sampling efficiency, we design a one-step off-policy training\npipeline for PSRL. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging mathematical\nreasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior\napproaches in terms of performance and sampling and training efficiency."}
