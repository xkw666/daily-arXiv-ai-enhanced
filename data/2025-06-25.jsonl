Objective: This study proposes and validates a novel\nSynthetic Vignette Simulation Approach to evaluate diagnostic performance\nchanges for individual rare diseases following SC algorithm updates. Methods:\nWe used disease-phenotype annotations from the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO),\na knowledge database for rare diseases, to generate synthetic vignettes.

The method's effectiveness was evaluated\nretrospectively by comparing estimated values with actual metric changes using\nthe R 2(R-squared) coefficient. Results: The experiment included eight past SC\nalgorithm updates. For updates on diseases with frequency information in HPO\n(n=5), the R^2 for recall@8 change was 0.831 (p=0.031), and for precision@8\nchange, it was 0.78 (p=0.047), indicating the method can predict\npost-deployment performance.

We reframe this performance collapse through the lens\nof an agentic gap, asserting that the models are not failing at reasoning, but\nat execution within a profoundly restrictive interface. We empirically\nsubstantiate this critique by demonstrating a striking reversal. A model,\ninitially declaring a puzzle impossible when confined to text-only generation,\nnow employs agentic tools to not only solve it but also master variations of\ncomplexity far beyond the reasoning cliff it previously failed to surmount.\nAdditionally, our empirical analysis of tool-enabled models like o4-mini and\nGPT-4o reveals a hierarchy of agentic reasoning, from simple procedural\nexecution to complex meta-cognitive self-correction, which has significant\nimplications for how we define and measure machine intelligence.

However, their long-form chain-of-thought reasoning\ncreates interpretability challenges as each generated token depends on all\nprevious ones, making the computation harder to decompose. We argue that\nanalyzing reasoning traces at the sentence level is a promising approach to\nunderstanding reasoning processes. We present three complementary attribution\nmethods: (1) a black-box method measuring each sentence's counterfactual\nimportance by comparing final answers across 100 rollouts conditioned on the\nmodel generating that sentence or one with a different meaning; (2) a white-box\nmethod of aggregating attention patterns between pairs of sentences, which\nidentified ``broadcasting'' sentences that receive disproportionate attention\nfrom all future sentences via ``receiver'' attention heads; (3) a causal\nattribution method measuring logical connections between sentences by\nsuppressing attention toward one sentence and measuring the effect on each\nfuture sentence's tokens. Each method provides evidence for the existence of\nthought anchors, reasoning steps that have outsized importance and that\ndisproportionately influence the subsequent reasoning process. These thought\nanchors are typically planning or backtracking sentences. We provide an\nopen-source tool (www.thought-anchors.com) for visualizing the outputs of our\nmethods, and present a case study showing converging patterns across methods\nthat map how a model performs multi-step reasoning. The consistency across\nmethods demonstrates the potential of sentence-level analysis for a deeper\nunderstanding of reasoning models."}

The key\nchallenges of high-quality image captioning lie in the inherent biases of\nLVLMs: multimodal bias resulting in imbalanced descriptive granularity,\noffering detailed accounts of some elements while merely skimming over others;\nlinguistic bias leading to hallucinated descriptions of non-existent objects.\nTo address these issues, we propose a scalable debiased captioning strategy,\nwhich continuously enriches and calibrates the caption with increased inference\nbudget. Specifically, we propose two novel components: heuristic question\nanswering and contrastive sentence rating. The former generates\ncontent-specific questions based on the image and answers them to progressively\ninject relevant information into the caption. The latter employs sentence-level\noffline contrastive decoding to effectively identify and eliminate\nhallucinations caused by linguistic biases. With increased inference cost, more\nheuristic questions are raised by ScaleCap to progressively capture additional\nvisual details, generating captions that are more accurate, balanced, and\ninformative. Extensive modality alignment experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of ScaleCap. Annotating 450K images with ScaleCap and using them\nfor LVLM pretraining leads to consistent performance gains across 11 widely\nused benchmarks. Furthermore, ScaleCap showcases superb richness and fidelity\nof generated captions with two additional tasks: replacing images with captions\nin VQA task, and reconstructing images from captions to assess semantic\ncoverage.
