Public sentiment plays a critical role in diplomacy, as a good\nsentiment provides vital support for policy implementation, helps resolve\ninternational issues, and shapes a nation's international image. Traditional\nmethods for gauging public sentiment, such as large-scale surveys or manual\ncontent analysis of media, are typically time-consuming, labor-intensive, and\nlack the capacity for forward-looking analysis. We propose a novel framework\nthat identifies specific modifications for diplomatic event narratives to shift\npublic sentiment from negative to neutral or positive. First, we train a\nlanguage model to predict public reaction towards diplomatic events. To this\nend, we construct a dataset comprising descriptions of diplomatic events and\ntheir associated public discussions. Second, guided by communication theories\nand in collaboration with domain experts, we predetermined several textual\nfeatures for modification, ensuring that any alterations changed the event's\nnarrative framing while preserving its core facts.We develop a counterfactual\ngeneration algorithm that employs a large language model to systematically\nproduce modified versions of an original text. The results show that this\nframework successfully shifted public sentiment to a more favorable state with\na 70\\% success rate. This framework can therefore serve as a practical tool for\ndiplomats, policymakers, and communication specialists, offering data-driven\ninsights on how to frame diplomatic initiatives or report on events to foster a\nmore desirable public sentiment."}

While traditional hair modeling methods focus on\nrealistic hair using strand-based or volumetric representations, anime\nhairstyle exhibits highly stylized, piecewise-structured geometry that\nchallenges existing techniques. Existing works often rely on dense mesh\nmodeling or hand-crafted spline curves, making them inefficient for editing and\nunsuitable for scalable learning. CHARM introduces a compact, invertible\ncontrol-point-based parameterization, where a sequence of control points\nrepresents each hair card, and each point is encoded with only five geometric\nparameters. This efficient and accurate representation supports both\nartist-friendly design and learning-based generation. Built upon this\nrepresentation, CHARM introduces an autoregressive generative framework that\neffectively generates anime hairstyles from input images or point clouds. By\ninterpreting anime hairstyles as a sequential \"hair language\", our\nautoregressive transformer captures both local geometry and global hairstyle\ntopology, resulting in high-fidelity anime hairstyle creation. To facilitate\nboth training and evaluation of anime hairstyle generation, we construct\nAnimeHair, a large-scale dataset of 37K high-quality anime hairstyles with\nseparated hair cards and processed mesh data. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nstate-of-the-art performance of CHARM in both reconstruction accuracy and\ngeneration quality, offering an expressive and scalable solution for anime\nhairstyle modeling.

Based on our prompting findings, we train\nand evaluate MRMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement\nfine-tuning (RFT).

We further evaluated LLaMA-Omni\nseries and discovered a paradoxical pattern; while overall responses seems\nidentical regardless of gender, the pattern is far from unbiased responses.\nSpecifically, in Gender-Stereotypical questions, all models consistently\nexhibited male-oriented responses; meanwhile, in Gender-Dependent questions\nwhere gender differentiation would be contextually appropriate, models\nexhibited responses independent to gender instead. We also confirm that this\npattern does not result from neutral options nor perceived gender of a voice.\nWhen we allow neutral response, models tends to respond neutrally also in\nGender-Dependent questions.

However, they typically rely on autoencoders\nconstrained by some implicit training-time regularization on single training\ninstances (i.e., $L_1$ normalization, top-k function, etc.), without an\nexplicit guarantee of global sparsity among instances, causing a large amount\nof dense (simultaneously inactive) features, harming the feature sparsity and\natomization. In this paper, we propose a novel autoencoder variant that\nenforces minimal entropy on minibatches of hidden activations, thereby\npromoting feature independence and sparsity across instances. For efficient\nentropy calculation, we discretize the hidden activations to 1-bit via a step\nfunction and apply gradient estimation to enable backpropagation, so that we\nterm it as Binary Autoencoder (BAE) and empirically demonstrate two major\napplications: (1) Feature set entropy calculation. Entropy can be reliably\nestimated on binary hidden activations, which we empirically evaluate and\nleverage to characterize the inference dynamics of LLMs and In-context\nLearning. (2) Feature untangling. Similar to typical methods, BAE can extract\natomized features from LLM's hidden states. To robustly evaluate such feature\nextraction capability, we refine traditional feature-interpretation methods to\navoid unreliable handling of numerical tokens, and show that BAE avoids dense\nfeatures while producing the largest number of interpretable ones among\nbaselines, which confirms the effectiveness of BAE serving as a feature\nextractor."}

In this\npaper, we investigate the mechanism through a novel perspective of information\nremoval. Specifically, we demonstrate that in the zero-shot scenario, LMs\nencode queries into non-selective representations in hidden states containing\ninformation for all possible tasks, leading to arbitrary outputs without\nfocusing on the intended task, resulting in near-zero accuracy. Meanwhile, we\nfind that selectively removing specific information from hidden states by a\nlow-rank filter effectively steers LMs toward the intended task. Building on\nthese findings, by measuring the hidden states on carefully designed metrics,\nwe observe that few-shot ICL effectively simulates such task-oriented\ninformation removal processes, selectively removing the redundant information\nfrom entangled non-selective representations, and improving the output based on\nthe demonstrations, which constitutes a key mechanism underlying ICL. Moreover,\nwe identify essential attention heads inducing the removal operation, termed\nDenoising Heads, which enables the ablation experiments blocking the\ninformation removal operation from the inference, where the ICL accuracy\nsignificantly degrades, especially when the correct label is absent from the\nfew-shot demonstrations, confirming both the critical role of the information\nremoval mechanism and denoising heads."}
