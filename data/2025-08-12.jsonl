These derivations are often complex and model-specific, and\ntypically consider a statistical aggregate of a large surface area, ignoring\nspatial variation. Once an analytic BRDF's evaluation is defined, one still\nneeds to design an importance sampling method for it, and a way to evaluate the\npdf of that sampling distribution, requiring further model-specific\nderivations.\n  We present PureSample: a novel neural BRDF representation that allows\nlearning a material's behavior purely by sampling forward random walks on the\nmicrogeometry, which is usually straightforward to implement. Our\nrepresentation allows for efficient importance sampling, pdf evaluation, and\nBRDF evaluation, for homogeneous as well as spatially varying materials.\n  We achieve this by two learnable components: first, the sampling distribution\nis modeled using a flow matching neural network, which allows both importance\nsampling and pdf evaluation; second, we introduce a view-dependent albedo term,\ncaptured by a lightweight neural network, which allows for converting a scalar\npdf value to a colored BRDF value for any pair of view and light directions.\n  We demonstrate PureSample on challenging materials, including multi-layered\nmaterials, multiple-scattering microfacet materials, and various other\nmicrostructures."}

However, most\nstate-of-the-art methods are under transductive settings, assuming all tools\nhave been observed during training. Such a setting deviates from reality as the\nreal-world tool repository is evolving and incorporates new tools frequently.\nWhen dealing with these unseen tools, which refer to tools not encountered\nduring the training phase, these methods are limited by two key issues,\nincluding the large distribution shift and the vulnerability of\nsimilarity-based retrieval. To this end, inspired by human cognitive processes\nof mastering unseen tools through discovering and applying the logical\ninformation from prior experience, we introduce a novel Logic-Guided Semantic\nBridging framework for inductive tool retrieval, namely, LoSemB, which aims to\nmine and transfer latent logical information for inductive tool retrieval\nwithout costly retraining. Specifically, LoSemB contains a logic-based\nembedding alignment module to mitigate distribution shifts and implements a\nrelational augmented retrieval mechanism to reduce the vulnerability of\nsimilarity-based retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoSemB\nachieves advanced performance in inductive settings while maintaining desirable\neffectiveness in the transductive setting."}

A key challenge underlying this limitation is the\nmodality gap between speech and text representations. The high variability in\nspeech embeddings may allow SLMs to achieve strong in-domain performance by\nexploiting unintended speech variations, ultimately hindering generalization.\nTo mitigate this modality gap, we introduce Optimal Transport Regularization\n(OTReg), a method that formulates speech-text alignment as an optimal transport\nproblem and derives a regularization loss to improve SLM training. In each\ntraining iteration, OTReg first establishes a structured correspondence between\nspeech and transcript embeddings by determining the optimal transport plan,\nthen incorporates the regularization loss based on this transport plan to\noptimize SLMs in generating speech embeddings that align more effectively with\ntranscript embeddings. OTReg is lightweight, requiring no additional labels or\nlearnable parameters, and integrates seamlessly into existing SLM training\nprocedures.

We introduce Conversational DNA, a novel visual\nlanguage that treats any dialogue -- whether between humans, between human and\nAI, or among groups -- as a living system with interpretable structure that can\nbe visualized, compared, and understood. Unlike traditional conversation\nanalysis that reduces rich interaction to statistical summaries, our approach\nreveals the temporal architecture of dialogue through biological metaphors.\nLinguistic complexity flows through strand thickness, emotional trajectories\ncascade through color gradients, conversational relevance forms through\nconnecting elements, and topic coherence maintains structural integrity through\nhelical patterns. Through exploratory analysis of therapeutic conversations and\nhistorically significant human-AI dialogues, we demonstrate how this\nvisualization approach reveals interaction patterns that traditional methods\nmiss. Our work contributes a new creative framework for understanding\ncommunication that bridges data visualization, human-computer interaction, and\nthe fundamental question of what makes dialogue meaningful in an age where\nhumans increasingly converse with artificial minds."}

While RL\ndrives this self-improvement paradigm, a recent study (Gandhi et al., 2025)\nshows that RL alone does not truly instill these new reasoning abilities - it\nmerely draws out behaviors already present in the base models. This raises a\nquestion: How can we train the models that don't exhibit such thinking behavior\nto develop it in the first place? To this end, we propose ThinkTuning, a\nGRPO-based interactive training approach where we augment the rollouts of a\nstudent model with the guidance from a teacher model. A simple idea from\nclassroom practice inspires our method: a teacher poses a problem, lets the\nstudent try an answer, then gives corrective feedback -- enough to point the\nmind in the right direction and then show the solution. Each piece of feedback\nreshapes the student's thoughts, leading them to arrive at the correct\nsolution. Similarly, we find that this type of implicit supervision through\nfeedback from a teacher model of the same size improves the reasoning\ncapabilities of the student model. In particular, on average, our method shows\na 3.85% improvement over zero-shot baselines across benchmarks, and on\nMATH-500, AIME and GPQA-Diamond it shows 2.08%, 2.23% and 3.99% improvements\nover the vanilla-GRPO baseline.

This\nlimitation hinders the adaptability of LLMs to practical scenarios, making\nmulti-objective alignment (MOA) a critical yet underexplored area. To bridge\nthis gap, we propose Pareto Multi-Objective Alignment (PAMA), a principled and\ncomputationally efficient algorithm designed explicitly for MOA in LLMs. In\ncontrast to computationally prohibitive multi-objective optimization (MOO)\nmethods, PAMA transforms multi-objective RLHF into a convex optimization with a\nclosed-form solution, significantly enhancing scalability.
