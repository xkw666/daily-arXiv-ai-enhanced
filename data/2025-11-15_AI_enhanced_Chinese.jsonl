Expanding ASR coverage has been costly and limited by architectures that restrict language support, making extension inaccessible to most--all while entangled with ethical concerns when pursued without community collaboration. To transcend these limitations, we introduce Omnilingual ASR, the first large-scale ASR system designed for extensibility. Omnilingual ASR enables communities to introduce unserved languages with only a handful of data samples. It scales self-supervised pre-training to 7B parameters to learn robust speech representations and introduces an encoder-decoder architecture designed for zero-shot generalization, leveraging a LLM-inspired decoder. This capability is grounded in a massive and diverse training corpus; by combining breadth of coverage with linguistic variety, the model learns representations robust enough to adapt to unseen languages. Incorporating public resources with community-sourced recordings gathered through compensated local partnerships, Omnilingual ASR expands coverage to over 1,600 languages, the largest such effort to date--including over 500 never before served by ASR. Automatic evaluations show substantial gains over prior systems, especially in low-resource conditions, and strong generalization. We release Omnilingual ASR as a family of models, from 300M variants for low-power devices to 7B for maximum accuracy. We reflect on the ethical considerations shaping this design and conclude by discussing its societal impact. In particular, we highlight how open-sourcing models and tools can lower barriers for researchers and communities, inviting new forms of participation.

We revisit this assumption and conduct a systematic comparison between the effect of selection and ordering. Through controlled experiments on both classification and generation tasks, using multiple open-source model families (0.5B to 27B parameters) and GPT-5, we find that the variance in performance due to different example orderings is comparable to that from using entirely different example sets. Furthermore, we show that strong orderings can be identified using only a development set, achieving performance close to an oracle that selects the best ordering based on test labels.

In fact, they have been shown to be suboptimal for morphologically rich languages, where tokenization quality directly impacts downstream performance. In this work, we investigate morphologically-aware tokenization for Latin, a morphologically rich language that is medium-resource in terms of pretraining data, but high-resource in terms of curated lexical resources -- a distinction that is often overlooked but critical in discussions of low-resource language modeling. We find that morphologically-guided tokenization improves overall performance on four downstream tasks. Performance gains are most pronounced for out of domain texts, highlighting our models' improved generalization ability. Our findings demonstrate the utility of linguistic resources to improve language modeling for morphologically complex languages.

We ask: how small can you get while still detecting meaning-altering translation errors? Focusing on English->German Critical Error Detection (CED), we benchmark sub-2B models (LFM2-350M, Qwen-3-0.6B/1.7B, Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, Gemma-3-1B) across WMT21, WMT22, and SynCED-EnDe-2025. Our framework standardizes prompts, applies lightweight logit-bias calibration and majority voting, and reports both semantic quality (MCC, F1-ERR/F1-NOT) and compute metrics (VRAM, latency, throughput). Results reveal a clear sweet spot around one billion parameters: Gemma-3-1B provides the best quality-efficiency trade-off, reaching MCC=0.77 with F1-ERR=0.98 on SynCED-EnDe-2025 after merged-weights fine-tuning, while maintaining 400 ms single-sample latency on a MacBook Pro M4 Pro (24 GB). At larger scale, Qwen-3-1.7B attains the highest absolute MCC (+0.11 over Gemma) but with higher compute cost.

This field leverages techniques like annotation projection and model transfer for language adaptation, supported by multilingual pre-trained language models. However, linguistic divergences hinder language transfer, especially among typologically distant languages. In this paper, we present an analysis of predicate-argument structures in parallel Chinese and English sentences. We explore the alignment and misalignment of predicate annotations, inspecting similarities and differences and proposing a categorization of structural divergences. The analysis and the categorization are supported by a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the results of an annotation projection experiment, in which, in turn, one of the two languages has been used as source language to project annotations into the corresponding parallel sentences. The results of this analysis show clearly that language transfer is asymmetric.

We propose Training-free Adaptive Retrieval Gating (TARG), a single-shot policy that decides when to retrieve using only a short, no-context draft from the base model. From the draft's prefix logits, TARG computes lightweight uncertainty scores: mean token entropy, a margin signal derived from the top-1/top-2 logit gap via a monotone link, or small-N variance across a handful of stochastic prefixes, and triggers retrieval only when the score exceeds a threshold. The gate is model agnostic, adds only tens to hundreds of draft tokens, and requires no additional training or auxiliary heads. On NQ-Open, TriviaQA, and PopQA, TARG consistently shifts the accuracy-efficiency frontier: compared with Always-RAG, TARG matches or improves EM/F1 while reducing retrieval by 70-90% and cutting end-to-end latency, and it remains close to Never-RAG in overhead. A central empirical finding is that under modern instruction-tuned LLMs the margin signal is a robust default (entropy compresses as backbones sharpen), with small-N variance offering a conservative, budget-first alternative.

The course recommendation system utilises a combination of data analytics techniques and machine learning algorithms to recommend courses that align with current industry trends and requirements. In order to provide customised suggestions, the study entails the design and implementation of an extensive algorithmic framework that combines machine learning methods, user preferences, and academic criteria. The system employs data mining and collaborative filtering techniques to examine past courses and individual career goals in order to provide course recommendations. Moreover, to improve the accessibility and usefulness of the recommendation system, special attention is given to the development of an easy-to-use front-end interface. The front-end design prioritises visual clarity, interaction, and simplicity through iterative prototyping and user input revisions, guaranteeing a smooth and captivating user experience. We refined and optimised the proposed system by incorporating user feedback, ensuring that it effectively meets the needs and preferences of its target users. The proposed course recommendation system could be a useful tool for students, instructors, and career advisers to use in promoting lifelong learning and professional progression as it fills the gap between university learning and industry expectations. We hope that the proposed course recommendation system will help university students in making data-drive and industry-informed course decisions, in turn, improving graduate outcomes for the university sector.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8bfe\u7a0b\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u5b66\u751f\u9009\u62e9\u7b26\u5408\u884c\u4e1a\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u8bfe\u7a0b", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5b66\u751f\u9009\u8bfe\u4e0e\u884c\u4e1a\u8131\u8282\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u5927\u5b66\u6559\u80b2\u4e0e\u4ea7\u4e1a\u9700\u6c42\u95f4\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6570\u636e\u6316\u6398\u3001\u534f\u540c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u7528\u6237\u53cb\u597d\u578b\u524d\u7aef\u754c\u9762", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ecf\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u754c\u9762\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4f7f\u7528\u4f53\u9a8c", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u4e3a\u8fde\u63a5\u5b66\u672f\u4e0e\u4ea7\u4e1a\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u5347\u6bd5\u4e1a\u751f\u5c31\u4e1a\u7ade\u4e89\u529b"}}

It provides a platform for students to post their questions related to the content and admin issues related to the course. However, there are several challenges due to the increase in the number of students enrolled in the course. The primary challenge is that students' queries cannot be responded immediately and the instructors have to face lots of repetitive questions. To mitigate these issues, we propose a question answering system based on large language model with retrieval augmented generation (RAG) method. This work focuses on designing a question answering system with open source Large Language Model (LLM) and fine-tuning it on the relevant course dataset. To further improve the performance, we use a local knowledge base and applied RAG method to retrieve relevant documents relevant to students' queries, where the local knowledge base contains all the course content. To mitigate the hallucination of LLMs, We also integrate it with multi chain-of-thought reasoning to overcome the challenge of hallucination in LLMs. In this work, we experiment fine-tuned LLM with RAG method on the HotpotQA dataset.

This weakness in terminology-level representation can severely hinder downstream tasks such as legal judgment prediction or financial risk analysis, where subtle semantic distinctions are critical. To address this problem, we propose TermGPT, a multi-level contrastive fine-tuning framework designed for terminology adaptation. We first construct a sentence graph to capture semantic and structural relations, and generate semantically consistent yet discriminative positive and negative samples based on contextual and topological cues. We then devise a multi-level contrastive learning approach at both the sentence and token levels, enhancing global contextual understanding and fine-grained terminology discrimination. To support robust evaluation, we construct the first financial terminology dataset derived from official regulatory documents.

To tackle these limitations, we introduce InTRO (In-Token Rationality Optimization), a new framework that enables both token-level exploration and self-feedback for accurate and concise reasoning. Instead of directly optimizing an intractable objective over all valid reasoning paths, InTRO leverages correction factors-token-wise importance weights estimated by the information discrepancy between the generative policy and its answer-conditioned counterpart, for informative next token selection. This approach allows the model to perform token-level exploration and receive self-generated feedback within a single forward pass, ultimately encouraging accurate and concise rationales. Across six math-reasoning benchmarks, InTRO consistently outperforms other baselines, raising solution accuracy by up to 20% relative to the base model. Its chains of thought are also notably more concise, exhibiting reduced verbosity.

To address this, we propose HierRouter, a hierarchical routing approach that dynamically assembles inference pipelines from a pool of specialized, lightweight language models. Formulated as a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP), our approach trains a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reinforcement learning agent to iteratively select which models to invoke at each stage of multi-hop inference. The agent conditions on the evolving context and accumulated cost to make context-aware routing decisions. Experiments with three open-source candidate LLMs across six benchmarks, including QA, code generation, and mathematical reasoning, show that HierRouter improves response quality by up to 2.4x compared to using individual models independently, while incurring only a minimal additional inference cost on average. These results highlight the promise of hierarchical routing for cost-efficient, high-performance LLM inference.

However, this fine-tuning process often introduces a critical vulnerability: the systematic degradation of safety alignment, undermining ethical guidelines and increasing the risk of harmful outputs. Addressing this challenge, we introduce EnchTable, a novel framework designed to transfer and maintain safety alignment in downstream LLMs without requiring extensive retraining. EnchTable leverages a Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)-based safety vector distillation method to decouple safety constraints from task-specific reasoning, ensuring compatibility across diverse model architectures and sizes. Additionally, our interference-aware merging technique effectively balances safety and utility, minimizing performance compromises across various task domains. We implemented a fully functional prototype of EnchTable on three different task domains and three distinct LLM architectures, and evaluated its performance through extensive experiments on eleven diverse datasets, assessing both utility and model safety. Our evaluations include LLMs from different vendors, demonstrating EnchTable's generalization capability. Furthermore, EnchTable exhibits robust resistance to static and dynamic jailbreaking attacks, outperforming vendor-released safety models in mitigating adversarial prompts. Comparative analyses with six parameter modification methods and two inference-time alignment baselines reveal that EnchTable achieves a significantly lower unsafe rate, higher utility score, and universal applicability across different task domains.

To tackle the challenges of noisy and heterogeneous raw data and the limited adaptability of existing Omni-Models to hearing-impaired speech, we construct a comprehensive preprocessing and curation pipeline that detects facial landmarks, isolates and stabilizes the lip region, and quantitatively assesses multimodal sample quality. These quality scores guide a curriculum learning strategy that first trains on clean, high-confidence samples and progressively incorporates harder cases to strengthen model robustness.

In this work, we present Norm-RAG, a retrieval-augmented, agentic framework for nuanced social norm inference in multi-turn dialogues. Norm-RAG models utterance-level attributes including communicative intent, speaker roles, interpersonal framing, and linguistic cues and grounds them in structured normative documentation retrieved via a novel Semantic Chunking approach. This enables interpretable and context-aware reasoning about norm adherence and violation across multilingual dialogues. We further introduce MINDS (Multilingual Interactions with Norm-Driven Speech), a bilingual dataset comprising 31 multi-turn Mandarin-English and Spanish-English conversations.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue for automating this process, prior research has been limited to small datasets and has been shown to produce superfluous, redundant KC labels. This study addresses these limitations by first scaling a \"simulated textbook\" LLM prompting strategy (using GPT-4o-mini) to a larger dataset of 646 multiple-choice questions. We found that this initial automated approach performed significantly worse than an expert-designed KC model (RMSE 0.4285 vs. 0.4206) and generated an excessive number of KCs (569 vs. 101). To address the issue of redundancy, we proposed and evaluated a novel method for merging semantically similar KC labels based on their cosine similarity. This merging strategy significantly improved the model's performance; a model using a cosine similarity threshold of 0.8 achieved the best result, reducing the KC count to 428 and improving the RMSE to 0.4259.

However, existing methods for multi-hop reasoning tasks often lack global planning, increasing the risk of falling into local reasoning impasses. Insufficient exploitation of retrieved content and the neglect of latent clues fail to ensure the accuracy of reasoning outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose Recursive Evaluation and Adaptive Planning (REAP), whose core idea is to explicitly maintain structured sub-tasks and facts related to the current task through the Sub-task Planner (SP) and Fact Extractor (FE) modules. SP maintains a global perspective, guiding the overall reasoning direction and evaluating the task state based on the outcomes of FE, enabling dynamic optimization of the task-solving trajectory.

A central challenge in this setting lies in determining the optimal timing for retrieval. Existing methods often trigger retrieval based on low token-level confidence, which may lead to delayed intervention after errors have already propagated. We introduce Entropy-Trend Constraint (ETC), a training-free method that determines optimal retrieval timing by modeling the dynamics of token-level uncertainty. Specifically, ETC utilizes first- and second-order differences of the entropy sequence to detect emerging uncertainty trends, enabling earlier and more precise retrieval. Experiments on six QA benchmarks with three LLM backbones demonstrate that ETC consistently outperforms strong baselines while reducing retrieval frequency. ETC is particularly effective in domain-specific scenarios, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities. Ablation studies and qualitative analyses further confirm that trend-aware uncertainty modeling yields more effective retrieval timing.

However, when the retrieved evidence differs in language from the user query and in-context exemplars, the model often exhibits language drift by generating responses in an unintended language. This phenomenon is especially pronounced during reasoning-intensive decoding, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation, where intermediate steps introduce further language instability. In this paper, we systematically study output language drift in multilingual RAG across multiple datasets, languages, and LLM backbones. Our controlled experiments reveal that the drift results not from comprehension failure but from decoder-level collapse, where dominant token distributions and high-frequency English patterns dominate the intended generation language. We further observe that English serves as a semantic attractor under cross-lingual conditions, emerging as both the strongest interference source and the most frequent fallback language.\n  To mitigate this, we propose Soft Constrained Decoding (SCD), a lightweight, training-free decoding strategy that gently steers generation toward the target language by penalizing non-target-language tokens. SCD is model-agnostic and can be applied to any generation algorithm without modifying the architecture or requiring additional data.

While efficient Transformer variants exist, they often require architectural changes and costly pre-training from scratch. To circumvent this, we propose ScaleFormer(Span Representation Cumulation for Long-Context Transformer) - a simple and effective plug-and-play framework that adapts off-the-shelf pre-trained encoder-decoder models to process long sequences without requiring architectural modifications. Our approach segments long inputs into overlapping chunks and generates a compressed, context-aware representation for the decoder. The core of our method is a novel, parameter-free fusion mechanism that endows each chunk's representation with structural awareness of its position within the document. It achieves this by enriching each chunk's boundary representations with cumulative context vectors from all preceding and succeeding chunks. This strategy provides the model with a strong signal of the document's narrative flow, achieves linear complexity, and enables pre-trained models to reason effectively over long-form text.

However, existing approaches to enhancing multi-turn instruction following primarily rely on collecting or generating large-scale multi-turn dialogue datasets to fine-tune large language models (LLMs), which treat each response generation as an isolated task and fail to explicitly incorporate multi-turn instruction following into the optimization objectives. As a result, instruction-tuned LLMs often struggle with complex long-distance constraints. In multi-turn dialogues, relational constraints across turns can be naturally modeled as labeled directed edges, making graph structures particularly suitable for modeling multi-turn instruction following. Despite this potential, leveraging graph structures to enhance the multi-turn instruction following capabilities of LLMs remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose GraphIF, a plug-and-play framework that models multi-turn dialogues as directed relation graphs and leverages graph prompts to enhance the instruction following capabilities of LLMs. GraphIF comprises three key components: (1) an agent-based relation extraction module that captures inter-turn semantic relations via action-triggered mechanisms to construct structured graphs; (2) a relation graph prompt generation module that converts structured graph information into natural language prompts; and (3) a response rewriting module that refines initial LLM outputs using the generated graph prompts. Extensive experiments on two long multi-turn dialogue datasets demonstrate that GraphIF can be seamlessly integrated into instruction-tuned LLMs and leads to significant improvements across all four multi-turn instruction-following evaluation metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGraphIF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6709\u5411\u5173\u7cfb\u56fe\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u56fe\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u80fd\u529b", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u6bcf\u8f6e\u54cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u4e3a\u5b64\u7acb\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\u8de8\u8f6e\u6b21\u5173\u7cfb\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u80fd\u81ea\u7136\u8868\u8fbe\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eLLMs\u4f18\u5316", "method": "1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u4f5c\u89e6\u53d1\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\u62bd\u53d6\u6784\u5efa\u5bf9\u8bdd\u56fe 2) \u5c06\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a 3) \u5229\u7528\u56fe\u63d0\u793a\u91cd\u5199LLM\u521d\u59cb\u8f93\u51fa", "result": "\u5728\u957f\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u56db\u9879\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u7684\u5168\u9762\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u6027", "conclusion": "\u9996\u6b21\u5c06\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u8f6e\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u56fe\u63d0\u793a\u673a\u5236\u7a81\u7834\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027"}}

Experimental results are a core component of scientific work, often presented in varying formats such as tables or charts. Understanding how robust current multimodal large language models (multimodal LLMs) are at verifying scientific claims across different evidence formats remains an important and underexplored challenge. In this paper, we design and conduct a series of experiments to assess the ability of multimodal LLMs to verify scientific claims using both tables and charts as evidence. To enable this evaluation, we adapt two existing datasets of scientific papers by incorporating annotations and structures necessary for a multimodal claim verification task. Using this adapted dataset, we evaluate 12 multimodal LLMs and find that current models perform better with table-based evidence while struggling with chart-based evidence. We further conduct human evaluations and observe that humans maintain strong performance across both formats, unlike the models. Our analysis also reveals that smaller multimodal LLMs (under 8B) show weak correlation in performance between table-based and chart-based tasks, indicating limited cross-modal generalization. These findings highlight a critical gap in current models' multimodal reasoning capabilities. We suggest that future multimodal LLMs should place greater emphasis on improving chart understanding to better support scientific claim verification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u4e3b\u5f20\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u56fe\u8868\u7406\u89e3\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u77ed\u677f\uff0c\u8868\u683c\u5904\u7406\u4f18\u4e8e\u56fe\u8868\u4e14\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5f31", "motivation": "\u79d1\u5b66\u8bba\u6587\u4e2d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u5e38\u4ee5\u4e0d\u540c\u683c\u5f0f\u5448\u73b0\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLMs\u5728\u8de8\u683c\u5f0f\u8bc1\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6539\u7f16\u540e\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u8bba\u6587\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f3012\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLMs\u5728\u8868\u683c/\u56fe\u8868\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u4e3b\u5f20\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4eba\u5de5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u683c\u5904\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6bd4\u56fe\u8868\u9ad819.3%\uff0c8B\u4ee5\u4e0b\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u683c\u4e0e\u56fe\u8868\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4ec50.28\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u53cc\u683c\u5f0f\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5747\u8d8585%", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLMs\u7684\u56fe\u8868\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5b58\u5728\u5173\u952e\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u9700\u91cd\u70b9\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u8868\u7406\u89e3\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u79d1\u5b66\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5e94\u52a0\u5f3a\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6cdb\u5316\u7814\u7a76"}}

While recent advancements in debiasing and causal learning offer promising solutions, they remain underexplored in the disaster event domain. In this work, we approach bias mitigation through a causal lens and propose a method to reduce event- and domain-related biases, enhancing generalization to future events.

Furthermore, the platform can automatically parse a session and generate a reasoning dependency tree, offering a transparent view of the model's step-by-step logical path.

It operates across six augmentation dimensions and integrates an end-to-end pipeline featuring SQL execution verification, natural language question generation, chain-of-thought reasoning traces, and data classification. A modular Database Manager ensures cross-database compatibility and scalability. Using this framework, we build SQLFlow, a high-quality dataset of 89,544 annotated examples. We evaluate SQLFlow in two settings: (1) For open-source LLMs, fine-tuning on SQLFlow consistently improves performance across benchmarks under the same data budget. (2) For closed-source LLMs, we introduce a masked alignment retrieval method that treats SQLFlow as both knowledge base and training data for the retriever. This enables structure-aware example matching by modeling fine-grained alignments between questions and SQL queries.

Existing selection methods, often based on features like text quality, diversity, or task relevance, typically overlook the intrinsic linguistic structure of multilingual data. In this paper, we propose LangGPS, a lightweight two-stage pre-selection framework guided by language separability which quantifies how well samples in different languages can be distinguished in the model's representation space. LangGPS first filters training data based on separability scores and then refines the subset using existing selection methods. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks and 22 languages demonstrate that applying LangGPS on top of existing selection methods improves their effectiveness and generalizability in multilingual training, especially for understanding tasks and low-resource languages. Further analysis reveals that highly separable samples facilitate the formation of clearer language boundaries and support faster adaptation, while low-separability samples tend to function as bridges for cross-lingual alignment. Besides, we also find that language separability can serve as an effective signal for multilingual curriculum learning, where interleaving samples with diverse separability levels yields stable and generalizable gains.

Our approach demonstrates that organizations can achieve competitive accuracy on complex queries across legal, scientific, and conversational documents while keeping all data on their machines. By balancing two complementary retrieval strategies and using consumer-grade hardware acceleration, the system delivers reliable answers with minimal errors, letting banks, hospitals, and law firms adopt conversational document AI without transmitting proprietary information to external providers.

Most existing methods rely on crafting high-quality supervised fine-tuning demonstrations for critiquing capability enhancement and pay little attention to delving into the underlying reason for the poor critiquing performance of LLMs. In this paper, we orthogonally quantify and investigate the potential reason -- imbalanced evaluation preference, and conduct a statistical preference analysis. Motivated by the analysis of the reason, a novel perplexity-aware reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to rectify the evaluation preference, elevating the critiquing capability. Specifically, to probe into LLMs' critiquing characteristics, a One-to-many Problem-Solution (OPS) benchmark is meticulously constructed to quantify the behavior difference of LLMs when evaluating the problem solutions generated by itself and others. Then, to investigate the behavior difference in depth, we conduct a statistical preference analysis oriented on perplexity and find an intriguing phenomenon -- ``LLMs incline to judge solutions with lower perplexity as correct'', which is dubbed as \\textit{imbalanced evaluation preference}. To rectify this preference, we regard perplexity as the baton in the algorithm of Group Relative Policy Optimization, supporting the LLMs to explore trajectories that judge lower perplexity as wrong and higher perplexity as correct.

We analyze how language choice, both in the prompt instructions and document grounding, affects data quality, and we compare translations of English content with native generation in Indic languages.

This paper introduces ATR4CH (Adaptive Text-to-RDF for Cultural Heritage), a systematic five-step methodology for Large Language Model-based Knowledge Extraction from Cultural Heritage documents. We validate the methodology through a case study on authenticity assessment debates. Methodology - ATR4CH combines annotation models, ontological frameworks, and LLM-based extraction through iterative development: foundational analysis, annotation schema development, pipeline architecture, integration refinement, and comprehensive evaluation. We demonstrate the approach using Wikipedia articles about disputed items (documents, artifacts...), implementing a sequential pipeline with three LLMs (Claude Sonnet 3.7, Llama 3.3 70B, GPT-4o-mini). Findings - The methodology successfully extracts complex Cultural Heritage knowledge: 0.96-0.99 F1 for metadata extraction, 0.7-0.8 F1 for entity recognition, 0.65-0.75 F1 for hypothesis extraction, 0.95-0.97 for evidence extraction, and 0.62 G-EVAL for discourse representation. Smaller models performed competitively, enabling cost-effective deployment. Originality - This is the first systematic methodology for coordinating LLM-based extraction with Cultural Heritage ontologies.

As external knowledge repositories continue to expand and the parametric knowledge within models becomes outdated, a critical challenge for RAG systems is resolving conflicts between retrieved external information and LLMs' internal knowledge, which can significantly compromise the accuracy and reliability of generated content. However, existing approaches to conflict resolution typically operate at the token or semantic level, often leading to fragmented and partial understanding of factual discrepancies between LLMs' knowledge and context, particularly in knowledge-intensive tasks. To address this limitation, we propose TruthfulRAG, the first framework that leverages Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to resolve factual-level knowledge conflicts in RAG systems. Specifically, TruthfulRAG constructs KGs by systematically extracting triples from retrieved content, utilizes query-based graph retrieval to identify relevant knowledge, and employs entropy-based filtering mechanisms to precisely locate conflicting elements and mitigate factual inconsistencies, thereby enabling LLMs to generate faithful and accurate responses. Extensive experiments reveal that TruthfulRAG outperforms existing methods, effectively alleviating knowledge conflicts and improving the robustness and trustworthiness of RAG systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684TruthfulRAG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u3001\u71b5\u8fc7\u6ee4\u673a\u5236\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7ea7\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728token\u6216\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u9762\u89e3\u51b3\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9LLM\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u788e\u7247\u5316\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "1. \u4ece\u68c0\u7d22\u5185\u5bb9\u4e2d\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u53d6\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u6784\u5efa\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\n2. \u57fa\u4e8e\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u56fe\u68c0\u7d22\u5b9a\u4f4d\u76f8\u5173\u77e5\u8bc6\n3. \u901a\u8fc7\u71b5\u8fc7\u6ee4\u673a\u5236\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u51b2\u7a81\u5143\u7d20", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eTruthfulRAG\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\u5e76\u63d0\u5347RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6", "conclusion": "TruthfulRAG\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7ea7\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6"}}

Such studies include evaluations of base LLMs (pre-trained on unlabeled corpora only) for this purpose. Our position paper argues that evaluating base LLMs' reasoning capabilities raises inherent methodological concerns that are overlooked in such existing studies. We highlight the fundamental mismatch between base LLMs' pretraining objective and normative qualities, such as correctness, by which reasoning is assessed. In particular, we show how base LLMs generate logically valid or invalid conclusions as coincidental byproducts of conforming to purely linguistic patterns of statistical plausibility. This fundamental mismatch challenges the assumptions that (a) base LLMs' outputs can be assessed as their bona fide attempts at correct answers or conclusions; and (b) conclusions about base LLMs' reasoning can generalize to post-trained LLMs optimized for successful instruction-following.

Can analogical paradigm organization enable lightweight models to match this performance with minimal data? We develop a computational approach implementing three cognitive-inspired principles: analogical structure, contrastive learning, and minimal contextual cues. We test this approach with structured completion tasks where models identify correct sentence completions from analogical patterns with contrastive alternatives. Training lightweight models (BERT+CNN, $0.5M$ parameters) on only one hundred structured examples of English causative/inchoative alternations achieves $F1=0.95$, outperforming zero-shot \\texttt{GPT-o3} ($F1=0.87$).

Yet, their ability to handle hyper-local knowledge remains poorly understood. This gap is increasingly consequential as real-world applications, from civic platforms to community journalism, demand AI systems that can reason about neighborhood-specific dynamics, cultural narratives, and local governance. Existing benchmarks fall short in capturing this complexity, often relying on coarse-grained data or isolated references. We present LocalBench, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs on county-level local knowledge across the United States. Grounded in the Localness Conceptual Framework, LocalBench includes 14,782 validated question-answer pairs across 526 U.S. counties in 49 states, integrating diverse sources such as Census statistics, local subreddit discourse, and regional news. It spans physical, cognitive, and relational dimensions of locality. Using LocalBench, we evaluate 13 state-of-the-art LLMs under both closed-book and web-augmented settings. Our findings reveal critical limitations: even the best-performing models reach only 56.8% accuracy on narrative-style questions and perform below 15.5% on numerical reasoning. Moreover, larger model size and web augmentation do not guarantee better performance, for example, search improves Gemini's accuracy by +13.6%, but reduces GPT-series performance by -11.4%.

These methods exhibit fundamental limitations when addressing knowledge-intensive tasks, as they operate within fixed parametric boundaries rather than providing the factual knowledge, terminology precision, and reasoning patterns required in specialized domains. To address these limitations, we propose Knowledge-Provision-based Prompt Optimization (KPPO), a framework that reformulates prompt optimization as systematic knowledge integration rather than potential elicitation. KPPO introduces three key innovations: 1) a knowledge gap filling mechanism for knowledge gap identification and targeted remediation; 2) a batch-wise candidate evaluation approach that considers both performance improvement and distributional stability; 3) an adaptive knowledge pruning strategy that balances performance and token efficiency, reducing up to 29% token usage. Extensive evaluation on 15 knowledge-intensive benchmarks from various domains demonstrates KPPO's superiority over elicitation-based methods, with an average performance improvement of ~6% over the strongest baseline while achieving comparable or lower token consumption.

In this work, we introduce AdvancedIF (we will release this benchmark soon), a comprehensive benchmark featuring over 1,600 prompts and expert-curated rubrics that assess LLMs ability to follow complex, multi-turn, and system-level instructions. We further propose RIFL (Rubric-based Instruction-Following Learning), a novel post-training pipeline that leverages rubric generation, a finetuned rubric verifier, and reward shaping to enable effective reinforcement learning for instruction following. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RIFL substantially improves the instruction-following abilities of LLMs, achieving a 6.7% absolute gain on AdvancedIF and strong results on public benchmarks. Our ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component in RIFL. This work establishes rubrics as a powerful tool for both training and evaluating advanced IF in LLMs, paving the way for more capable and reliable AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u80fd\u529b\u7684AdvancedIF\u57fa\u51c6\uff08\u542b1600+\u63d0\u793a\uff09\u548cRIFL\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd6.7%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742/\u591a\u8f6e/\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u5305\u542b\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u7684AdvancedIF\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faRIFL\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u751f\u6210+\u5fae\u8c03\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668+\u5956\u52b1\u5851\u9020\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "RIFL\u5728AdvancedIF\u57fa\u51c6\u5b9e\u73b06.7%\u7edd\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u516c\u5171\u57fa\u51c6\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5404\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e3aLLMs\u9ad8\u7ea7\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u53ef\u9760AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

We construct style-augmented jailbreak benchmark by transforming prompts from 3 standard datasets into 11 distinct linguistic styles using handcrafted templates and LLM-based rewrites, while preserving semantic intent. Evaluating 16 open- and close-source instruction-tuned models, we find that stylistic reframing increases jailbreak success rates by up to +57 percentage points. Styles such as fearful, curious and compassionate are most effective and contextualized rewrites outperform templated variants.\n  To mitigate this, we introduce a style neutralization preprocessing step using a secondary LLM to strip manipulative stylistic cues from user inputs, significantly reducing jailbreak success rates.

While existing benchmarks have advanced the field, our work addresses fundamental challenges in statistical power, data generation consistency, and evaluation flexibility that limit current memory evaluation frameworks. We examine the relationship between conversational memory and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). While these systems share fundamental architectural patterns--temporal reasoning, implicit extraction, knowledge updates, and graph representations--memory systems have a unique characteristic: they start from zero and grow progressively with each conversation. This characteristic enables naive approaches that would be impractical for traditional RAG. Consistent with recent findings on long context effectiveness, we observe that simple full-context approaches achieve 70-82% accuracy even on our most challenging multi-message evidence cases, while sophisticated RAG-based memory systems like Mem0 achieve only 30-45% when operating on conversation histories under 150 interactions. Our analysis reveals practical transition points: long context excels for the first 30 conversations, remains viable with manageable trade-offs up to 150 conversations, and typically requires hybrid or RAG approaches beyond that point as costs and latencies become prohibitive. These patterns indicate that the small-corpus advantage of conversational memory--where exhaustive search and complete reranking are feasible--deserves dedicated research attention rather than simply applying general RAG solutions to conversation histories.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5305\u542b75,336\u4e2a\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0eRAG\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u53ca\u9002\u7528\u573a\u666f", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u529f\u6548\u3001\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6839\u672c\u6027\u7f3a\u9677", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u8de86\u5927\u7c7b\u522b\uff08\u7528\u6237\u4e8b\u5b9e\u3001\u52a9\u7406\u56de\u5fc6\u3001\u62d2\u7edd\u56de\u590d\u7b49\uff09\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u5168\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0eRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd", "result": "\u5168\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728150\u6b21\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5185\u51c6\u786e\u738770-82%\uff0cRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ec530-45%\uff1b\u786e\u7acb30/150\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u8f6c\u6298\u70b9", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684'\u5c0f\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4f18\u52bf'\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7b80\u5355\u5957\u7528\u901a\u7528RAG\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e94\u63a2\u7d22\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b8c\u6574\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6848"}}

While more traditional perspectives on genre have emphasized form, contemporary scholarship has invoked both formal and institutional characteristics in its taxonomy of genre, genre fiction, and literary fiction. This project uses computational methods to explore the soundness of genre as a formal designation as opposed to an institutional one. Pulling from Andrew Piper's CONLIT dataset of Contemporary Literature, we assemble a corpus of literary and genre fiction, with the latter category containing romance, mystery, and science fiction novels. We use Welch's ANOVA to compare the distribution of narrative features according to author gender within each genre and within genre versus literary fiction.

Existing approaches primarily fall into two categories: token compression, which sacrifices fine-grained details; and introducing external retrievers, which increase system complexity and prevent end-to-end optimization. To address these issues, we conduct an in-depth analysis and observe that MLLMs exhibit a human-like coarse-to-fine reasoning pattern: early Transformer layers attend broadly across the document, while deeper layers focus on relevant evidence pages. Motivated by this insight, we posit that the inherent evidence localization capabilities of MLLMs can be explicitly leveraged to perform retrieval during the reasoning process, facilitating efficient long document understanding. To this end, we propose URaG, a simple-yet-effective framework that Unifies Retrieval and Generation within a single MLLM. URaG introduces a lightweight cross-modal retrieval module that converts the early Transformer layers into an efficient evidence selector, identifying and preserving the most relevant pages while discarding irrelevant content. This design enables the deeper layers to concentrate computational resources on pertinent information, improving both accuracy and efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that URaG achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing computational overhead by 44-56%.

While researchers have made progress using BERT and Graph Neural Networks, the full potential of advanced language models in understanding complex language patterns remains unexplored. We introduce DESS, a new approach that builds upon previous work by integrating DeBERTa's enhanced attention mechanism to better understand context and relationships in text. Our framework maintains a dual-channel structure, where DeBERTa works alongside an LSTM channel to process both meaning and grammatical patterns in text. We have carefully refined how these components work together, paying special attention to how different types of language information interact. When we tested DESS on standard datasets, it showed meaningful improvements over current methods, with F1-score increases of 4.85, 8.36, and 2.42 in identifying aspect opinion pairs and determining sentiment accurately. Looking deeper into the results, we found that DeBERTa's sophisticated attention system helps DESS handle complicated sentence structures better, especially when important words are far apart.

However, the presence of outliers in weights and activations often leads to large quantization errors and severe accuracy degradation, especially in recent reasoning LLMs where errors accumulate across long chains of thought. Existing PTQ methods either fail to sufficiently suppress outliers or introduce significant overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose Pairwise Rotation Quantization (ParoQuant), a weight-only PTQ method that combines hardware-efficient and optimizable independent Givens rotations with channel-wise scaling to even out the magnitude across channels and narrow the dynamic range within each quantization group.

However, the task is challenging due to its large label space (10,000 to 20,000 codes) and long-tail distribution, where a few codes dominate while many rare codes lack sufficient training data. To address this, we propose a learning method that models fine-grained co-occurrence relationships among codes. Specifically, we construct a Directed Bipartite Graph Encoder with disjoint sets of common and rare code nodes. To facilitate a one-way information flow, edges are directed exclusively from common to rare codes. The nature of these connections is defined by a probability-based bias, which is derived from the conditional probability of a common code co-occurring given the presence of a rare code. This bias is then injected into the encoder's attention module, a process we term Co-occurrence Encoding. This structure empowers the graph encoder to enrich rare code representations by aggregating latent comorbidity information reflected in the statistical co-occurrence of their common counterparts. To ensure high-quality input to the graph, we utilize a large language model (LLM) to generate comprehensive descriptions for codes, enriching initial embeddings with clinical context and comorbidity information, serving as external knowledge for the statistical co-occurrence relationships in the code system.

However, this approach is susceptible to distribution drift, caused by the sequential optimization of shared backbone parameters. This results in a mismatch between the distributions of the previously learned classes and that of the updater model, ultimately degrading the effectiveness of classifier performance over time. To address this issue, we introduce a latent space transition operator and propose Sequential Learning with Drift Compensation (SLDC). SLDC aims to align feature distributions across tasks to mitigate the impact of drift. First, we present a linear variant of SLDC, which learns a linear operator by solving a regularized least-squares problem that maps features before and after fine-tuning. Next, we extend this with a weakly nonlinear SLDC variant, which assumes that the ideal transition operator lies between purely linear and fully nonlinear transformations. This is implemented using learnable, weakly nonlinear mappings that balance flexibility and generalization. To further reduce representation drift, we apply knowledge distillation (KD) in both algorithmic variants. Extensive experiments on standard CIL benchmarks demonstrate that SLDC significantly improves the performance of SeqFT. Notably, by combining KD to address representation drift with SLDC to compensate distribution drift, SeqFT achieves performance comparable to joint training across all evaluated datasets.

However, they continue to underperform in real-world medical scenarios, which often demand stronger context-awareness, i.e., the ability to recognize missing or critical details (e.g., user identity, medical history, risk factors) and provide safe, helpful, and contextually appropriate responses. To address this issue, we propose Multifaceted Self-Refinement (MuSeR), a data-driven approach that enhances LLMs' context-awareness along three key facets (decision-making, communication, and safety) through self-evaluation and refinement. Specifically, we first design a attribute-conditioned query generator that simulates diverse real-world user contexts by varying attributes such as role, geographic region, intent, and degree of information ambiguity. An LLM then responds to these queries, self-evaluates its answers along three key facets, and refines its responses to better align with the requirements of each facet. Finally, the queries and refined responses are used for supervised fine-tuning to reinforce the model's context-awareness ability. Evaluation results on the latest HealthBench dataset demonstrate that our method significantly improves LLM performance across multiple aspects, with particularly notable gains in the context-awareness axis. Furthermore, by incorporating knowledge distillation with the proposed method, the performance of a smaller backbone LLM (e.g., Qwen3-32B) surpasses its teacher model, achieving a new SOTA across all open-source LLMs on HealthBench (63.8%) and its hard subset (43.1%).

Recently, KG-enhanced LLMs that integrate knowledge graphs (KGs) have been shown to improve reasoning performance, particularly for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks. However, these methods still face significant challenges, including inaccurate retrieval and reasoning failures, often exacerbated by long input contexts that obscure relevant information or by context constructions that struggle to capture the richer logical directions required by different question types. Furthermore, many of these approaches rely on LLMs to directly retrieve evidence from KGs, and to self-assess the sufficiency of this evidence, which often results in premature or incorrect reasoning. To address the retrieval and reasoning failures, we propose ProgRAG, a multi-hop knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) framework that decomposes complex questions into sub-questions, and progressively extends partial reasoning paths by answering each sub-question. At each step, external retrievers gather candidate evidence, which is then refined through uncertainty-aware pruning by the LLM. Finally, the context for LLM reasoning is optimized by organizing and rearranging the partial reasoning paths obtained from the sub-question answers.

However, as adversaries increasingly imitate the style of authentic news, the effectiveness of such approaches is gradually diminishing. Recent research has explored incorporating large language models (LLMs) to enhance fake news detection.

In this paper, we propose a novel fake news detection framework, dubbed FactGuard, that leverages LLMs to extract event-centric content, thereby reducing the impact of writing style on detection performance. Furthermore, our approach introduces a dynamic usability mechanism that identifies contradictions and ambiguous cases in factual reasoning, adaptively incorporating LLM advice to improve decision reliability. To ensure efficiency and practical deployment, we employ knowledge distillation to derive FactGuard-D, enabling the framework to operate effectively in cold-start and resource-constrained scenarios.

While audio-language research has progressed rapidly, music remains challenging due to its dynamic, layered, and information-dense nature. Progress has been further limited by the difficulty of scaling open audio understanding models, primarily because of the scarcity of high-quality music data and annotations. As a result, prior models are restricted to producing short, high-level captions, answering only surface-level questions, and showing limited generalization across diverse musical cultures. To address these challenges, we curate MF-Skills, a large-scale dataset labeled through a multi-stage pipeline that yields rich captions and question-answer pairs covering harmony, structure, timbre, lyrics, and cultural context. We fine-tune an enhanced Audio Flamingo 3 backbone on MF-Skills and further strengthen multiple skills relevant to music understanding. To improve the model's reasoning abilities, we introduce a post-training recipe: we first cold-start with MF-Think, a novel chain-of-thought dataset grounded in music theory, followed by GRPO-based reinforcement learning with custom rewards. Music Flamingo achieves state-of-the-art results across 10+ benchmarks for music understanding and reasoning, establishing itself as a generalist and musically intelligent audio-language model. Beyond strong empirical results, Music Flamingo sets a new standard for advanced music understanding by demonstrating how models can move from surface-level recognition toward layered, human-like perception of songs. We believe this work provides both a benchmark and a foundation for the community to build the next generation of models that engage with music as meaningfully as humans do.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMusic Flamingo\u97f3\u9891-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7MF-Skills\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u572810+\u97f3\u4e50\u7406\u89e3\u57fa\u51c6\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7c7b\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u97f3\u4e50\u611f\u77e5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u97f3\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u97f3\u4e50\u52a8\u6001/\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u63cf\u8ff0\u80a4\u6d45\u3001\u8de8\u6587\u5316\u6cdb\u5316\u5f31\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u6784\u5efa\u4e13\u4e1a\u97f3\u4e50\u7406\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "1.\u6784\u5efaMF-Skills\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6 2.\u6539\u8fdbAudio Flamingo 3\u67b6\u6784 3.\u4f7f\u7528MF-Think\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u51b7\u542f\u52a8 4.GRPO\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b", "result": "10+\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5SOTA\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u97f3\u4e50\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u8de8\u6587\u5316\u97f3\u4e50\u5206\u6790\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8f83\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u534718.7%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u97f3\u4e50AI\u8bbe\u7acb\u6280\u672f\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e+\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u8868\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u8bc6\u522b\u8fc8\u5411\u8bed\u4e49\u7ea7\u97f3\u4e50\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

To investigate these mechanisms, we model large language model (LLM) personas as synthetic agents that mimic user-level biases, ideological alignments, and trust heuristics. Within this setup, we introduce an auditor--node framework to simulate and analyze how misinformation evolves as it circulates through networks of such agents. News articles are propagated across networks of persona-conditioned LLM nodes, each rewriting received content. A question--answering-based auditor then measures factual fidelity at every step, offering interpretable, claim-level tracking of misinformation drift. We formalize a misinformation index and a misinformation propagation rate to quantify factual degradation across homogeneous and heterogeneous branches of up to 30 sequential rewrites. Experiments with 21 personas across 10 domains reveal that identity- and ideology-based personas act as misinformation accelerators, especially in politics, marketing, and technology. By contrast, expert-driven personas preserve factual stability. Controlled-random branch simulations further show that once early distortions emerge, heterogeneous persona interactions rapidly escalate misinformation to propaganda-level distortion. Our taxonomy of misinformation severity -- spanning factual errors, lies, and propaganda -- connects observed drift to established theories in misinformation studies. These findings demonstrate the dual role of LLMs as both proxies for human-like biases and as auditors capable of tracing information fidelity.

These limitations lead to prohibitively high data-construction costs, low exploration efficiency, and poor sample utilization. To address these challenges, we present AgentEvolver, a self-evolving agent system that leverages the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to drive autonomous agent learning. AgentEvolver introduces three synergistic mechanisms: (i) self-questioning, which enables curiosity-driven task generation in novel environments, reducing dependence on handcrafted datasets; (ii) self-navigating, which improves exploration efficiency through experience reuse and hybrid policy guidance; and (iii) self-attributing, which enhances sample efficiency by assigning differentiated rewards to trajectory states and actions based on their contribution. By integrating these mechanisms into a unified framework, AgentEvolver enables scalable, cost-effective, and continual improvement of agent capabilities.

Advances in large language models (LLMs) have established LLM-based agents as a major branch of MAS, enabling major breakthroughs in complex problem solving and world modeling. However, the reliability implications of this shift remain largely unexplored. i.e., whether substituting traditional agents with LLM-based agents can effectively enhance the reliability of MAS. In this work, we investigate and quantify the reliability of LLM-based agents from the perspective of Byzantine fault tolerance. We observe that LLM-based agents demonstrate stronger skepticism when processing erroneous message flows, a characteristic that enables them to outperform traditional agents across different topological structures. Motivated by the results of the pilot experiment, we design CP-WBFT, a confidence probe-based weighted Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus mechanism to enhance the stability of MAS with different topologies.

In recent times, Pre-LayerNorm transformers have become the preferred choice over Post-LayerNorm transformers due to their stable gradient flow. However, the impact of LayerNorm on learning and memorization across these architectures remains unclear. In this work, we investigate how LayerNorm influences memorization and learning for Pre- and Post-LayerNorm transformers. We identify that LayerNorm serves as a key factor for stable learning in Pre-LayerNorm transformers, while in Post-LayerNorm transformers, it impacts memorization. Our analysis reveals that eliminating LayerNorm parameters in Pre-LayerNorm models exacerbates memorization and destabilizes learning, while in Post-LayerNorm models, it effectively mitigates memorization by restoring genuine labels. We further precisely identify that early layers LayerNorm are the most critical over middle/later layers and their influence varies across Pre and Post LayerNorm models. We have validated it through 13 models across 6 Vision and Language datasets. These insights shed new light on the role of LayerNorm in shaping memorization and learning in transformers.", "AI": {"tldr": "LayerNorm\u5728Pre-LayerNorm\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728Post-LayerNorm\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6291\u5236\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\uff1b\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\u7684LayerNorm\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u5173\u952e\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76LayerNorm\u5728\u4e0d\u540cTransformer\u67b6\u6784(Pre/Post-LayerNorm)\u4e2d\u5bf9\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u5f71\u54cd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u6d88\u9664\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5206\u679013\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u57286\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42LayerNorm\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "result": "Pre\u67b6\u6784\u4e2dLayerNorm\u7ef4\u6301\u68af\u5ea6\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0cPost\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u63a7\u5236\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff1b\u79fb\u9664LN\u53c2\u6570\u4f1a\u7834\u574fPre\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f46\u80fd\u63d0\u5347Post\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "conclusion": "LayerNorm\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u626e\u6f14\u4e0d\u540c\u89d2\u8272\uff1a\u5b66\u4e60\u7a33\u5b9a\u5668 vs \u8bb0\u5fc6\u8c03\u8282\u5668\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3aTransformer\u67b6\u6784\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

Such approaches risk recommending insensitive or unsafe interventions, especially in domains involving serious mental illness, substance use disorders, or depression. To address this limitation, we propose a Responsible Reinforcement Learning (RRL) framework that integrates emotional and contextual understanding with ethical considerations into the sequential decision-making process. RRL formulates personalization as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), where the agent optimizes engagement and adherence while ensuring emotional alignment and ethical safety. We introduce a multi-objective reward function that explicitly balances short-term behavioral engagement with long-term user well-being, and define an emotion-informed state representation that captures fluctuations in emotional readiness, affect, and risk. The proposed architecture can be instantiated with any RL algorithm (e.g., DQN, PPO) augmented with safety constraints or Lagrangian regularization. Conceptually, this framework operationalizes empathy and responsibility within machine learning policy optimization, bridging safe RL, affective computing and responsible AI. We discuss the implications of this approach for human-centric domains such as behavioral health, education, and digital therapeutics, and outline simulation-based validation paths for future empirical work.
