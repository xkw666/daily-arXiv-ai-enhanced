This research explored\nzero-shot deepfake detection, an emerging method even when the models have\nnever seen a particular deepfake variation. In this work, we studied\nself-supervised learning, transformer-based zero-shot classifier, generative\nmodel fingerprinting, and meta-learning techniques that better adapt to the\never-evolving deepfake threat. In addition, we suggested AI-driven prevention\nstrategies that mitigated the underlying generation pipeline of the deepfakes\nbefore they occurred. They consisted of adversarial perturbations for creating\ndeepfake generators, digital watermarking for content authenticity\nverification, real-time AI monitoring for content creation pipelines, and\nblockchain-based content verification frameworks. Despite these advancements,\nzero-shot detection and prevention faced critical challenges such as\nadversarial attacks, scalability constraints, ethical dilemmas, and the absence\nof standardized evaluation benchmarks. These limitations were addressed by\ndiscussing future research directions on explainable AI for deepfake detection,\nmultimodal fusion based on image, audio, and text analysis, quantum AI for\nenhanced security, and federated learning for privacy-preserving deepfake\ndetection.

One way to address\nthese limitations is to incorporate physically-based rendering, but it has been\nprohibitively expensive to include full global illumination within the inner\nloop of the optimization. Therefore, previous works adopt simplifications that\nmake the whole optimization with global illumination effects efficient but less\naccurate. In this work, we adopt Gaussian surfels as the primitives and build\nan efficient framework for differentiable light transport, inspired from the\nclassic radiosity theory. The whole framework operates in the coefficient space\nof spherical harmonics, enabling both diffuse and specular materials. We extend\nthe classic radiosity into non-binary visibility and semi-opaque primitives,\npropose novel solvers to efficiently solve the light transport, and derive the\nbackward pass for gradient optimizations, which is more efficient than\nauto-differentiation. During inference, we achieve view-independent rendering\nwhere light transport need not be recomputed under viewpoint changes, enabling\nhundreds of FPS for global illumination effects, including view-dependent\nreflections using a spherical harmonics representation.

To explore\nthe customization for such fine-grained features, we propose a novel\ncontrastive learning framework that disentangles fine-grained style and content\nfeatures with a single reference image, building on the classic concept of\nimage analogy.

Furthermore, applying\nLLMs to the abundant and evolving text in DyTAGs faces efficiency issues. To\ntackle these challenges, we propose Dynamic Global-Recent Adaptive Semantic\nProcessing (DyGRASP), a novel method that leverages LLMs and temporal GNNs to\nefficiently and effectively reason on DyTAGs.

In addition, to capture\nglobal semantic dynamics of nodes, we leverage explicit reasoning with tailored\nprompts and an RNN-like chain structure to infer long-term semantics. Lastly,\nwe intricately integrate the recent and global temporal semantics as well as\nthe dynamic graph structural information using updating and merging layers.\nExtensive experiments on DyTAG benchmarks demonstrate DyGRASP's superiority,\nachieving up to 34% improvement in Hit@10 for destination node retrieval task.\nBesides, DyGRASP exhibits strong generalization across different temporal GNNs\nand LLMs."}

However, practical use of\ncontinuous tokens has been limited by strong training difficulties: previous\nworks either just use continuous tokens at inference time on a pre-trained\ndiscrete-token model, or must distill the continuous CoT from ground-truth\ndiscrete CoTs and face computational costs that limit the CoT to very few\ntokens.\n  This is the first work introducing a scalable method to learn continuous CoTs\nvia reinforcement learning (RL), without distilling from reference discrete\nCoTs.

To address\nthis challenge, we introduce Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training data\n(RLPT), a new training-time scaling paradigm for optimizing LLMs. In contrast\nto prior approaches that scale training primarily through supervised learning,\nRLPT enables the policy to autonomously explore meaningful trajectories to\nlearn from pre-training data and improve its capability through reinforcement\nlearning (RL). While existing RL strategies such as reinforcement learning from\nhuman feedback (RLHF) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR)\nrely on human annotation for reward construction, RLPT eliminates this\ndependency by deriving reward signals directly from pre-training data.\nSpecifically, it adopts a next-segment reasoning objective, rewarding the\npolicy for accurately predicting subsequent text segments conditioned on the\npreceding context. This formulation allows RL to be scaled on pre-training\ndata, encouraging the exploration of richer trajectories across broader\ncontexts and thereby fostering more generalizable reasoning skills. Extensive\nexperiments on both general-domain and mathematical reasoning benchmarks across\nmultiple models validate the effectiveness of RLPT. For example, when applied\nto Qwen3-4B-Base, RLPT yields absolute improvements of $3.0$, $5.1$, $8.1$,\n$6.0$, $6.6$, and $5.3$ on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, GPQA-Diamond, KOR-Bench, AIME24, and\nAIME25, respectively.

However, tasks such as automatic speech\nrecognition (ASR) and speech emotion recognition (SER) rely on distinct types\nof information: ASR primarily depends on linguistic content, whereas SER\nrequires the integration of both linguistic and paralinguistic cues. Existing\nmultitask SLMs typically adopt naive parameter sharing or prompt-based\nconditioning without explicitly modeling the differences in information\ncomposition required by each task. Such designs risk task interference and\nperformance degradation, especially under limited data conditions. To address\nthese limitations, we propose HarmoniFuse, a component-selective and\nprompt-adaptive framework for multi-task speech language modeling. HarmoniFuse\nis designed to harmonize heterogeneous task demands by selecting and fusing\ntask-relevant components of speech representations. Specifically, it integrates\na gated speech encoder to extract task-specific acoustic features and a\nprompt-adaptive dynamic fusion module to aggregate transformer layers based on\ntask characteristics. In addition, a batch-interleaved training strategy\nenables leveraging separate ASR and SER datasets without requiring joint\nannotation. Experimental results demonstrate that HarmoniFuse improves both ASR\nand SER performance, offering a scalable and robust solution for multitask\nspeech understanding under realistic data constraints."}

This is fragile in multi-turn interactions; after a\nfailure the model often repeats the same mistake. We propose structured\nreflection, which turns the path from error to repair into an explicit,\ncontrollable, and trainable action. The agent produces a short yet precise\nreflection: it diagnoses the failure using evidence from the previous step and\nthen proposes a correct, executable follow-up call. For training we combine\nDAPO and GSPO objectives with a reward scheme tailored to tool use, optimizing\nthe stepwise strategy Reflect, then Call, then Final. To evaluate, we introduce\nTool-Reflection-Bench, a lightweight benchmark that programmatically checks\nstructural validity, executability, parameter correctness, and result\nconsistency. Tasks are built as mini trajectories of erroneous call,\nreflection, and corrected call, with disjoint train and test splits.\nExperiments on BFCL v3 and Tool-Reflection-Bench show large gains in multi-turn\ntool-call success and error recovery, and a reduction of redundant calls.
