Using large language models as statistical oracles, we measure the minimum context length (MCL) needed to reproduce accurate full-context predictions across datasets with sequences of varying lengths. For sequences with 1-7k tokens from long-context documents, we consistently find that 75-80% require only the last 96 tokens at most. Given the dominance of short-context tokens, we then ask whether it is possible to detect challenging long-context sequences for which a short local prefix does not suffice for prediction. We introduce a practical proxy to MCL, called Distributionally Aware MCL (DaMCL), that does not require knowledge of the actual next-token and is compatible with sampling strategies beyond greedy decoding. Our experiments validate that simple thresholding of the metric defining DaMCL achieves high performance in detecting long vs. short context sequences. Finally, to counter the bias that short-context dominance induces in LLM output distributions, we develop an intuitive decoding algorithm that leverages our detector to identify and boost tokens that are long-range-relevant. Across Q&A tasks and model architectures, we confirm that mitigating the bias improves performance."}

While existing embedding models address the first two constraints, they underperform on information retrieval in specialized domains like finance. This paper introduces a scalable pipeline that trains specialized models from an unlabeled corpus using a general purpose retrieval embedding model as foundation. Our method yields an average of 27.7% improvement in MRR$\\texttt{@}$5, 44.6% improvement in mean DCG$\\texttt{@}$5 across 14 financial filing types measured over 21,800 query-document pairs, and improved NDCG on 3 of 4 document classes in FinanceBench. We adapt retrieval embeddings (bi-encoder) for RAG, not LLM generators, using LLM-judged relevance to distill domain knowledge into a compact retriever. There are prior works which pair synthetically generated queries with real passages to directly fine-tune the retrieval model. Our pipeline differs from these by introducing interaction between student and teacher models that interleaves retrieval-based mining of hard positive/negative examples from the unlabeled corpus with iterative retraining of the student model's weights using these examples. Each retrieval iteration uses the refined student model to mine the corpus for progressively harder training examples for the subsequent training iteration. The methodology provides a cost-effective solution to bridging the gap between general-purpose models and specialized domains without requiring labor-intensive human annotation."}

Prior approaches typically rely on end-to-end training tied to a specific language or dataset, which limits their generality. In contrast, our method Segment, Embed, and Align (SEA) provides a single framework that works across multiple languages and domains. SEA leverages two pretrained models: the first to segment a video frame sequence into individual signs and the second to embed the video clip of each sign into a shared latent space with text. Alignment is subsequently performed with a lightweight dynamic programming procedure that runs efficiently on CPUs within a minute, even for hour-long episodes. SEA is flexible and can adapt to a wide range of scenarios, utilizing resources from small lexicons to large continuous corpora. Experiments on four sign language datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art alignment performance, highlighting the potential of SEA to generate high-quality parallel data for advancing sign language processing.

Previous approaches typically rely on off-the-shelf motion reconstruction techniques to obtain 3D trajectories for physics-based imitation. These reconstruction methods struggle with generalizability, as they either require 3D training data (potentially scarce) or fail to produce physically plausible poses, hindering their application to challenging scenarios like human-object interaction (HOI) or non-human characters. We tackle this challenge by introducing Mimic2DM, a novel motion imitation framework that learns the control policy directly and solely from widely available 2D keypoint trajectories extracted from videos. By minimizing the reprojection error, we train a general single-view 2D motion tracking policy capable of following arbitrary 2D reference motions in physics simulation, using only 2D motion data. The policy, when trained on diverse 2D motions captured from different or slightly different viewpoints, can further acquire 3D motion tracking capabilities by aggregating multiple views. Moreover, we develop a transformer-based autoregressive 2D motion generator and integrate it into a hierarchical control framework, where the generator produces high-quality 2D reference trajectories to guide the tracking policy. We show that the proposed approach is versatile and can effectively learn to synthesize physically plausible and diverse motions across a range of domains, including dancing, soccer dribbling, and animal movements, without any reliance on explicit 3D motion data.

Rewards are shaped using calibrated cross-entropy, removing label bias and aggregating across surface forms to improve transferability. The proposed method is evaluated on five diverse NLP benchmark datasets, covering sentiment, natural language inference, paraphrase, and commonsense reasoning, using three distinct language models: Qwen2-1.5B Instruct, TinyLlama-1.1B Chat, and Phi-1.5.

However, existing viewer solutions remain fragmented, heavy, or constrained by legacy pipelines, resulting in high deployment friction and limited support for dynamic content and generative models. In this work, we present Visionary, an open, web-native platform for real-time various Gaussian Splatting and meshes rendering. Built on an efficient WebGPU renderer with per-frame ONNX inference, Visionary enables dynamic neural processing while maintaining a lightweight, \"click-to-run\" browser experience. It introduces a standardized Gaussian Generator contract, which not only supports standard 3DGS rendering but also allows plug-and-play algorithms to generate or update Gaussians each frame. Such inference also enables us to apply feedforward generative post-processing. The platform further offers a plug in three.js library with a concise TypeScript API for seamless integration into existing web applications. Experiments show that, under identical 3DGS assets, Visionary achieves superior rendering efficiency compared to current Web viewers due to GPU-based primitive sorting. It already supports multiple variants, including MLP-based 3DGS, 4DGS, neural avatars, and style transformation or enhancement networks. By unifying inference and rendering directly in the browser, Visionary significantly lowers the barrier to reproduction, comparison, and deployment of 3DGS-family methods, serving as a unified World Model Carrier for both reconstructive and generative paradigms."}

Yet, research in this area has been limited in relation to a manifested problem in these models: gender bias. With this research, we aim to move away from simply measuring bias to exploring its origins. Working with gender-ambiguous natural source data, this study examines which context, in the form of input tokens in the source sentence, influences (or triggers) the translation model choice of a certain gender inflection in the target language. To analyse this, we use contrastive explanations and compute saliency attribution. We first address the challenge of a lacking scoring threshold and specifically examine different attribution levels of source words on the model gender decisions in the translation. We compare salient source words with human perceptions of gender and demonstrate a noticeable overlap between human perceptions and model attribution. Additionally, we provide a linguistic analysis of salient words. Our work showcases the relevance of understanding model translation decisions in terms of gender, how this compares to human decisions and that this information should be leveraged to mitigate gender bias."}

While flexible, VGGT features lack explicit multi-view geometric consistency, and we find that improving such 3D feature consistency benefits both NVS and pose estimation tasks. We introduce Selfi, a self-improving 3D reconstruction pipeline via feature alignment, transforming a VGGT backbone into a high-fidelity 3D reconstruction engine by leveraging its own outputs as pseudo-ground-truth. Specifically, we train a lightweight feature adapter using a reprojection-based consistency loss, which distills VGGT outputs into a new geometrically-aligned feature space that captures spatial proximity in 3D.

Consequently, there is a growing need for research on techniques that can detect inappropriate utterances within conversational texts to help build a safer communication environment. Although large-scale language models trained on Korean corpora and chain-of-thought reasoning have recently gained attention, research applying these approaches to inappropriate utterance detection remains limited. In this study, we propose a soft inductive bias approach that explicitly defines reasoning perspectives to guide the inference process, thereby promoting rational decision-making and preventing errors that may arise during reasoning. We fine-tune a Korean large language model using the proposed method and conduct both quantitative performance comparisons and qualitative evaluations across different training strategies. Experimental results show that the Kanana-1.5 model achieves an average accuracy of 87.0046, improving by approximately 3.89 percent over standard supervised learning. These findings indicate that the proposed method goes beyond simple knowledge imitation by large language models and enables more precise and consistent judgments through constrained reasoning perspectives, demonstrating its effectiveness for inappropriate utterance detection."}

A spatial curriculum progressively expands the operational region of the grid, ensuring that agents master easier central tasks before tackling harder peripheral ones. To improve reliability, the system integrates Negative Log-Likelihood as a measure of confidence, allowing the curriculum to prioritize regions where agents are both accurate and well calibrated.

To evaluate performance, we compared MOSAIC outputs against gold-standard annotations created by trained human coders. We developed and evaluated MOSAIC using 26 gold standard annotated transcripts for training and 50 transcripts for testing, spanning rheumatology and OB/GYN domains.

Our experiments on question-answering (Q/A) tasks using a PPO-based RLHF pipeline demonstrate that our adaptive approach consistently achieves superior fairness while maintaining competitive alignment scores. This work offers a robust methodology for evaluating LLM behavior across diverse populations and provides a practical solution for developing truly pluralistic and fairly aligned models."}

Existing studies on personality detection predominantly adopt a \"posts -> user vector -> labels\" modeling paradigm, which encodes social media posts into user representations for predicting personality labels (e.g., MBTI labels). While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have improved text encoding capacities, these approaches remain constrained by limited supervision signals due to label scarcity, and under-specified semantic mappings between user language and abstract psychological constructs. We address these challenges by proposing ROME, a novel framework that explicitly injects psychological knowledge into personality detection. Inspired by standardized self-assessment tests, ROME leverages LLMs' role-play capability to simulate user responses to validated psychometric questionnaires. These generated question-level answers transform free-form user posts into interpretable, questionnaire-grounded evidence linking linguistic cues to personality labels, thereby providing rich intermediate supervision to mitigate label scarcity while offering a semantic reasoning chain that guides and simplifies the text-to-personality mapping learning. A question-conditioned Mixture-of-Experts module then jointly routes over post and question representations, learning to answer questionnaire items under explicit supervision. The predicted answers are summarized into an interpretable answer vector and fused with the user representation for final prediction within a multi-task learning framework, where question answering serves as a powerful auxiliary task for personality detection. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that ROME consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving improvements (15.41% on Kaggle dataset)."}

Thus far, however, a mechanistic understanding of these gains has been missing. In this work, we establish a connection to recent work showing that layers in the second half of non-grown, pre-layernorm Transformers contribute much less to the final output distribution than those in the first half - also known as the Curse of Depth (Sun et al., 2025, Csordás et al., 2025). Using depth-wise analyses, we demonstrate that growth via gradual middle stacking yields more effective utilization of model depth, alters the residual stream structure, and facilitates the formation of permutable computational blocks. In addition, we propose a lightweight modification of MIDAS that yields further improvements in downstream reasoning benchmarks. Overall, this work highlights how the gradual growth of model depth can lead to the formation of distinct computational circuits and overcome the limited depth utilization seen in standard non-grown models."}

Existing hallucination detection methods for RAG often rely either on large-scale detector training, which requires substantial annotated data, or on querying external LLM judges, which leads to high inference costs. Although some approaches attempt to leverage internal representations of LLMs for hallucination detection, their accuracy remains limited. Motivated by recent advances in mechanistic interpretability, we employ sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to disentangle internal activations, successfully identifying features that are specifically triggered during RAG hallucinations. Building on a systematic pipeline of information-based feature selection and additive feature modeling, we introduce RAGLens, a lightweight hallucination detector that accurately flags unfaithful RAG outputs using LLM internal representations. RAGLens not only achieves superior detection performance compared to existing methods, but also provides interpretable rationales for its decisions, enabling effective post-hoc mitigation of unfaithful RAG. Finally, we justify our design choices and reveal new insights into the distribution of hallucination-related signals within LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/Teddy-XiongGZ/RAGLens."}

Recent work on adaptive parallel reasoning aims to improve inference efficiency by decomposing the problem-solving process into concurrent reasoning threads when beneficial. However, existing methods on realistic tasks are either limited to supervised behavior cloning or exhibit significant accuracy drops compared to widely-used sequential long chain-of-thought (CoT) baselines. Moreover, many require customized inference engines, complicating deployment. We introduce ThreadWeaver, a framework for adaptive parallel reasoning that achieves accuracy on par with popular sequential reasoning models of comparable size while significantly reducing inference latency. ThreadWeaver's performance stems from three key innovations: 1) a two-stage parallel trajectory generator that produces large-scale, high-quality CoT data with parallel annotations for supervised fine-tuning; 2) a trie-based training-inference co-design that enables parallel reasoning on any off-the-shelf autoregressive inference engine without modifying position embeddings or KV caches; and 3) a parallelization-aware reinforcement learning framework that teaches the model to balance accuracy with effective parallelization. Across six challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, ThreadWeaver trained atop Qwen3-8B achieves accuracy comparable to cutting-edge sequential reasoning models (71.9% on average and 79.9% on AIME24) while delivering up to 1.53x average speedup in token latency, establishing a new Pareto frontier between accuracy and efficiency."}

However, they suffer from high computational overhead under industrial latency and throughput requirements. In particular, cross-encoder ranking systems often create long context prefill-heavy workloads, as the model has to be presented with the user, query and item information. To this end, we propose MixLM, a novel LLM-based ranking framework, which significantly improves the system throughput via reducing the input context length, while preserving the semantic strength of cross-encoder rankers. In contrast to a standard ranking system where the context is presented to the model as pure text, we propose to use mix-interaction, a mixture of text and embedding tokens to represent the input. Specifically, MixLM encodes all items in the catalog into a few embedding tokens and stores in a nearline cache. The encoded item descriptions are used during online inference, effectively reducing the item length from a few thousand text tokens to a few embedding tokens. We share insights from deploying our MixLM framework to a real-world search application at LinkedIn, including a detailed discussion of our training pipelines, as well as a thorough analysis of our online serving infrastructure optimization. Comparing with strong baselines, MixLM increased throughput by 10.0x under the same latency budget, while maintaining relevance metrics. The efficiency gains delivered by MixLM enabled full-traffic deployment of LLM-powered search, which resulted in a significant 0.47% increase in Daily Active Users (DAU) in online A/B tests."}

Here we introduce a knowledge-driven AI Urban Scientist, built from hypotheses, peer-review signals, datasets and analytical patterns distilled from thousands of high-quality studies, and implemented as a coordinated multi-agent framework for end-to-end inquiry. The system generates structured hypotheses, retrieves and harmonizes heterogeneous datasets, conducts automated empirical analysis and simulation, and synthesizes insights in forms compatible with urban scientific reasoning.

We propose lightweight strategies for context-aware phonemization and a service-oriented TTS architecture that executes these modules as independent services. This design decouples heavy context-aware components from the core TTS engine, effectively breaking the latency barrier and enabling real-time use of high-quality phonemization models.

Common metrics used for this choice, such as Accuracy, Precision, and F1, are sensitive to class imbalance and to arbitrary choices of positive class, and can favor judges that distort prevalence estimates. We show that Youden's $J$ statistic is theoretically aligned with choosing the best judge to compare models, and that Balanced Accuracy is an equivalent linear transformation of $J$. Through both analytical arguments and empirical examples and simulations, we demonstrate how selecting judges using Balanced Accuracy leads to better, more robust classifier selection."}

Industrial standards, in particular, contain extensive technical information and complex rules presented in highly structured formats that combine tables, scopes of application, constraints, exceptions, and numerical calculations, making KG construction especially challenging. In this study, we propose a method that organizes such documents into a hierarchical semantic structure, decomposes sentences and tables into atomic propositions derived from conditional and numerical rules, and integrates them into an ontology-knowledge graph through LLM-based triple extraction. Our approach captures both the hierarchical and logical structures of documents, effectively representing domain-specific semantics that conventional methods fail to reflect. To verify its effectiveness, we constructed rule, table, and multi-hop QA datasets, as well as a toxic clause detection dataset, from industrial standards, and implemented an ontology-aware KG-RAG framework for comparative evaluation. Experimental results show that our method achieves significant performance improvements across all QA types compared to existing KG-RAG approaches.

A residual interpolation schedule, together with lightweight reconstruction and knowledge distillation losses, ensures that the PHM modules inherit the functional behavior of their dense counterparts during training. This transition yields substantial parameter and FLOP reductions while preserving strong multimodal alignment, enabling faster inference without degrading output quality. We evaluate the approach on multiple vision-language models (VLMs).

However, the problem of sign-to-sign retrieval or detecting a specific sign within a sequence of continuous signs remains largely unexplored. We define this novel task as Sign Language Spotting. In this paper, we present a first step toward sign language retrieval by addressing the challenge of detecting the presence or absence of a query sign video within a sentence-level gloss or sign video. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on intermediate gloss recognition or text-based matching, we propose an end-to-end model that directly operates on pose keypoints extracted from sign videos. Our architecture employs an encoder-only backbone with a binary classification head to determine whether the query sign appears within the target sequence. By focusing on pose representations instead of raw RGB frames, our method significantly reduces computational cost and mitigates visual noise. We evaluate our approach on the Word Presence Prediction dataset from the WSLP 2025 shared task, achieving 61.88\\% accuracy and 60.00\\% F1-score.
