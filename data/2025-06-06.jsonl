Our method preserves the structural fidelity of\nthe input sketch while effectively transferring stylistic attributes from a\nreference image. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on predefined noise\nschedules - which often compromise perceptual consistency -- our framework\nbuilds on continuous-time diffusion models and introduces SSIMBaD (Sigma\nScaling with SSIM-Guided Balanced Diffusion). SSIMBaD applies a sigma-space\ntransformation that aligns perceptual degradation, as measured by structural\nsimilarity (SSIM), in a linear manner. This scaling ensures uniform visual\ndifficulty across timesteps, enabling more balanced and faithful\nreconstructions. Experiments on a large-scale Anime face dataset demonstrate\nthat our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in both pixel accuracy and\nperceptual quality, while generalizing to diverse styles.

Despite\nextensive prior research, existing approaches often suffer from low output\nquality, require significant manual tuning, or depend on data-intensive\ntraining.

We begin by applying cone singularity\ndetection to identify a sparse set of potential handles. The VLM is then\nprompted to select both the deformable sub-parts of the mesh and the handles\nthat best align with user instructions. Subsequently, we query the desired\ndeformed positions of the selected handles in screen space. To reduce\nuncertainty inherent in VLM predictions, we aggregate the results from multiple\ncamera views using a novel multi-view voting scheme. % Across a suite of\nbenchmarks, our method produces deformations that align more closely with user\nintent, as measured by CLIP and GPTEval3D scores, while introducing low\ndistortion -- quantified via membrane energy.

With dense voxel labels, prior works\ntypically formulate it as a dense segmentation task, independently classifying\neach voxel. However, this paradigm neglects critical instance-centric\ndiscriminability, leading to instance-level incompleteness and adjacent\nambiguities. To address this, we highlight a free lunch of occupancy labels:\nthe voxel-level class label implicitly provides insight at the instance level,\nwhich is overlooked by the community. Motivated by this observation, we first\nintroduce a training-free Voxel-to-Instance (VoxNT) trick: a simple yet\neffective method that freely converts voxel-level class labels into\ninstance-level offset labels. Building on this, we further propose VoxDet, an\ninstance-centric framework that reformulates the voxel-level occupancy\nprediction as dense object detection by decoupling it into two sub-tasks:\noffset regression and semantic prediction. Specifically, based on the lifted 3D\nvolume, VoxDet first uses (a) Spatially-decoupled Voxel Encoder to generate\ndisentangled feature volumes for the two sub-tasks, which learn task-specific\nspatial deformation in the densely projected tri-perceptive space. Then, we\ndeploy (b) Task-decoupled Dense Predictor to address this task via dense\ndetection. Here, we first regress a 4D offset field to estimate distances (6\ndirections) between voxels and object borders in the voxel space. The regressed\noffsets are then used to guide the instance-level aggregation in the\nclassification branch, achieving instance-aware prediction. Experiments show\nthat VoxDet can be deployed on both camera and LiDAR input, jointly achieving\nstate-of-the-art results on both benchmarks.

The\nscheme comprises of three phases: initial segmentation, iterative vertex\ninsertion, and iterative merging, followed by vertex adjustment. The initial\nsegmentation is used to detect sharp turnings - the vertices that seemingly\nhave high curvature. It is likely that some of important vertices with low\ncurvature might have been missed out at the first phase and so iterative vertex\ninsertion is used to add vertices in a region where the curvature changes\nslowly but steadily.

The contact tractions between interacting discrete segments are\nevaluated with respect to a midplane in a single pass, inherently maintaining\nthe equilibrium of tractions. These tractions are based on the penalisation of\ntrue interpenetration between opposite surfaces, and the procedure of their\nintegral for discrete contacting segments is described in this paper. A\nmeticulous examination of the different possible geometric configurations of\ninteracting 3D segments is presented to develop visual understanding and better\ntraction evaluation accuracy. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed\nmethod are validated against the analytical solutions of the contact patch\ntest, two-beam bending, Hertzian contact, and flat punch test, thus proving the\ncapability to reproduce contact between flat surfaces, curved surfaces, and\nsharp corners in contact, respectively. The method passes the contact patch\ntest with the uniform transmission of contact pressure matching the accuracy\nlevels of finite elements. It converges towards the analytical solution with\nmesh refinement and a suitably high penalty factor. The effectiveness of the\nproposed algorithm also extends to self-contact problems and has been tested\nfor self-contact between flat and curved surfaces with inelastic material.\nDynamic problems of elastic and inelastic collisions between bars, as well as\noblique collisions of cylinders, are also presented.

This paper presents a systematic\nanalysis of how two popular watermarking approaches-Gumbel and KGW-affect these\ncore alignment properties across four aligned LLMs. Our experiments reveal two\ndistinct degradation patterns: guard attenuation, where enhanced helpfulness\nundermines model safety, and guard amplification, where excessive caution\nreduces model helpfulness. These patterns emerge from watermark-induced shifts\nin token distribution, surfacing the fundamental tension that exists between\nalignment objectives.\n  To mitigate these degradations, we propose Alignment Resampling (AR), an\ninference-time sampling method that uses an external reward model to restore\nalignment. We establish a theoretical lower bound on the improvement in\nexpected reward score as the sample size is increased and empirically\ndemonstrate that sampling just 2-4 watermarked generations effectively recovers\nor surpasses baseline (unwatermarked) alignment scores. To overcome the limited\nresponse diversity of standard Gumbel watermarking, our modified implementation\nsacrifices strict distortion-freeness while maintaining robust detectability,\nensuring compatibility with AR.

In order to extract semantic\ninformation from phrases and expressions, CNN uses a variety of convolution\nkernel filters to capture local n-gram patterns. In the meanwhile, BERT creates\ncontext-rich representations of whole sequences by utilizing stacked\nbidirectional transformer encoders. Using BERT's attention processes, the\nintegrated error detection component relates tokens to spot translation\nirregularities including word order problems and omissions. The correction\nmodule then uses parallel English-German alignment and GRU decoder models in\nconjunction with translation memory to propose logical modifications that\nmaintain original meaning. A unified end-to-end training process optimized for\npost-editing performance is applied to the whole pipeline. The multi-domain\ncollection of WMT and the conversational dialogues of Open-Subtitles are two of\nthe English-German parallel corpora used to train the model. Multiple loss\nfunctions supervise detection and correction capabilities. Experiments attain a\n90% accuracy, 89.37% F1, and 16.24% MSE, exceeding recent proofreading\ntechniques by over 10% overall. Comparative benchmarking demonstrates\nstate-of-the-art performance in identifying and coherently rectifying\nmistranslations and omissions."}

However, these reasoning traces can be redundant or logically\ninconsistent, making them a new source of hallucination that is difficult to\ndetect. Existing hallucination detection methods focus primarily on\nanswer-level uncertainty and often fail to detect hallucinations or logical\ninconsistencies arising from the model's reasoning trace. This oversight is\nparticularly problematic for LRMs, where the explicit thinking trace is not\nonly an important support to the model's decision-making process but also a key\nsource of potential hallucination. To this end, we propose RACE (Reasoning and\nAnswer Consistency Evaluation), a novel framework specifically tailored for\nhallucination detection in LRMs. RACE operates by extracting essential\nreasoning steps and computing four diagnostic signals: inter-sample consistency\nof reasoning traces, entropy-based answer uncertainty, semantic alignment\nbetween reasoning and answers, and internal coherence of reasoning. This joint\nanalysis enables fine-grained hallucination detection even when the final\nanswer appears correct. Experiments across datasets and different LLMs\ndemonstrate that RACE outperforms existing hallucination detection baselines,\noffering a robust and generalizable solution for evaluating LRMs. Our code is\navailable at: https://github.com/bebr2/RACE."}

Among the various technologies driving this transformation, Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for creating educational\nmaterials and question answering, but there are still space for new\napplications. Educators commonly use Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) to assess\nstudent knowledge, but manually generating these questions is\nresource-intensive and requires significant time and cognitive effort. In our\nopinion, LLMs offer a promising solution to these challenges. This paper\npresents a novel comparative analysis of three widely known LLMs - Llama 2,\nMistral, and GPT-3.5 - to explore their potential for creating informative and\nchallenging MCQs. In our approach, we do not rely on the knowledge of the LLM,\nbut we inject the knowledge into the prompt to contrast the hallucinations,\ngiving the educators control over the test's source text, too. Our experiment\ninvolving 21 educators shows that GPT-3.5 generates the most effective MCQs\nacross several known metrics. Additionally, it shows that there is still some\nreluctance to adopt AI in the educational field.

To make\nhyper-scaling practical, we introduce Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), a\nnovel method for sparsifying KV caches that only requires 1K training steps to\nachieve 8$\\times$ compression, while maintaining better accuracy than\ntraining-free sparse attention. Instead of prematurely discarding cached\ntokens, DMS delays token eviction, implicitly merging representations and\npreserving critical information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\ninference-time hyper-scaling with DMS on multiple families of LLMs, showing\nthat it boosts accuracy for comparable inference runtime and memory load. For\ninstance, we enhance Qwen-R1 32B by an average of 9.1 points on AIME 24, 7.6 on\nGPQA, and 9.6 on LiveCodeBench across compute budgets."}

However, existing mitigation strategies primarily focus\non reactively addressing jailbreak incidents after safety guardrails have been\ncompromised, removing harmful gradients during fine-tuning, or continuously\nreinforcing safety alignment throughout fine-tuning. As such, they tend to\noverlook a critical upstream factor: the role of the original safety-alignment\ndata. This paper therefore investigates the degradation of safety guardrails\nthrough the lens of representation similarity between upstream alignment\ndatasets and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that\nhigh similarity between these datasets significantly weakens safety guardrails,\nmaking models more susceptible to jailbreaks. Conversely, low similarity\nbetween these two types of datasets yields substantially more robust models and\nthus reduces harmfulness score by up to 10.33%. By highlighting the importance\nof upstream dataset design in the building of durable safety guardrails and\nreducing real-world vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, these findings offer\nactionable insights for fine-tuning service providers."}
