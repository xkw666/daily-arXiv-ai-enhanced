TL;DR: 构建老年患者出院摘要中不良事件抽取的标注语料库，测试显示Transformer模型在粗粒度任务表现优异但细粒度属性识别存在挑战


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决老年患者群体在临床NLP资源中代表性不足的问题，支持非连续/重叠实体识别等复杂临床语言特征

Method: 使用FlairNLP框架评估多模型在三粒度标注任务上的表现（细粒度/粗粒度/带否定的粗粒度）

Result: BERT模型文档级粗粒度抽取达F1=0.943，细粒度实体级任务F1降至0.675，罕见事件和复杂属性识别显著下降

Conclusion: 现有方法对少数群体AE检测和临床语言细微差异捕捉仍存在局限，该数据集为AE抽取方法评估提供可靠基准

Abstract: In this work, we present a manually annotated corpus for Adverse Event (AE)
extraction from discharge summaries of elderly patients, a population often
underrepresented in clinical NLP resources. The dataset includes 14 clinically
significant AEs-such as falls, delirium, and intracranial haemorrhage, along
with contextual attributes like negation, diagnosis type, and in-hospital
occurrence. Uniquely, the annotation schema supports both discontinuous and
overlapping entities, addressing challenges rarely tackled in prior work. We
evaluate multiple models using FlairNLP across three annotation granularities:
fine-grained, coarse-grained, and coarse-grained with negation. While
transformer-based models (e.g., BERT-cased) achieve strong performance on
document-level coarse-grained extraction (F1 = 0.943), performance drops
notably for fine-grained entity-level tasks (e.g., F1 = 0.675), particularly
for rare events and complex attributes. These results demonstrate that despite
high-level scores, significant challenges remain in detecting underrepresented
AEs and capturing nuanced clinical language. Developed within a Trusted
Research Environment (TRE), the dataset is available upon request via DataLoch
and serves as a robust benchmark for evaluating AE extraction methods and
supporting future cross-dataset generalisation.

### [2] [Combining Constrained and Unconstrained Decoding via Boosting: BoostCD and Its Application to Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14901)
*Marija Šakota,Robert West*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Many recent approaches to structured NLP tasks use an autoregressive language
model $M$ to map unstructured input text $x$ to output text $y$ representing
structured objects (such as tuples, lists, trees, code, etc.), where the
desired output structure is enforced via constrained decoding. During training,
these approaches do not require the model to be aware of the constraints, which
are merely implicit in the training outputs $y$. This is advantageous as it
allows for dynamic constraints without requiring retraining, but can lead to
low-quality output during constrained decoding at test time. We overcome this
problem with Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD), which combines constrained
and unconstrained decoding in two phases: Phase 1 decodes from the base model
$M$ twice, in constrained and unconstrained mode, obtaining two weak
predictions. In phase 2, a learned autoregressive boosted model combines the
two weak predictions into one final prediction. The mistakes made by the base
model with vs. without constraints tend to be complementary, which the boosted
model learns to exploit for improved performance. We demonstrate the power of
BoostCD by applying it to closed information extraction. Our model, BoostIE,
outperforms prior approaches both in and out of distribution, addressing
several common errors identified in those approaches.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出CrEst框架通过文档间语义一致性自动评估上下文可信度，在无需人工标注的情况下显著提升大语言模型在知识密集型任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视上下文文档的可信度差异，可能导致不可靠信息传播。需要自动化评估文档可信度的解决方案。

Method: 基于文档间语义一致性的弱监督框架，提出黑盒（外部集成）和白盒（修改注意力机制）两种可信度集成策略。

Result: 在3种模型架构和5个数据集上实现最高26.86%准确率提升和3.49% F1分数提升，高噪声环境下保持稳健表现。

Conclusion: CrEst有效提升LLM推理可靠性，证明文档间一致性可作为无监督可信度评估的有效指标，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The integration of contextual information has significantly enhanced the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks.
However, existing methods often overlook a critical challenge: the credibility
of context documents can vary widely, potentially leading to the propagation of
unreliable information. In this paper, we introduce CrEst, a novel weakly
supervised framework for assessing the credibility of context documents during
LLM inference--without requiring manual annotations. Our approach is grounded
in the insight that credible documents tend to exhibit higher semantic
coherence with other credible documents, enabling automated credibility
estimation through inter-document agreement. To incorporate credibility into
LLM inference, we propose two integration strategies: a black-box approach for
models without access to internal weights or activations, and a white-box
method that directly modifies attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments
across three model architectures and five datasets demonstrate that CrEst
consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to a 26.86% improvement
in accuracy and a 3.49% increase in F1 score. Further analysis shows that CrEst
maintains robust performance even under high-noise conditions.

*Joseph J. Peper,Wenzhao Qiu,Ali Payani,Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出MDBench数据集，通过合成生成方法评估大语言模型在多文档推理中的表现，解决现有基准不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多文档推理基准稀缺且标注成本高，需要高效可控的生成方法评估LLMs的长文本处理能力。

Method: 基于结构化种子知识进行LLM辅助编辑，生成挑战性文档集和QA样本，并转化为自然文本形式。

Result: MDBench对主流LLMs构成显著挑战，其知识引导的生成技术支持针对性分析和快速适应新需求。

Conclusion: MDBench填补多文档推理评估空白，合成方法兼具高效性和扩展性，为模型评估提供有效工具。

Abstract: Natural language processing evaluation has made significant progress, largely
driven by the proliferation of powerful large language mod-els (LLMs). New
evaluation benchmarks are of increasing priority as the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs are expanding at a rapid pace. In particular, while multi-document (MD)
reasoning is an area of extreme relevance given LLM capabilities in handling
longer-context inputs, few benchmarks exist to rigorously examine model
behavior in this setting. Moreover, the multi-document setting is historically
challenging for benchmark creation due to the expensive cost of annotating long
inputs. In this work, we introduce MDBench, a new dataset for evaluating LLMs
on the task of multi-document reasoning. Notably, MDBench is created through a
novel synthetic generation process, allowing us to controllably and efficiently
generate challenging document sets and the corresponding question-answer (QA)
examples. Our novel technique operates on condensed structured seed knowledge,
modifying it through LLM-assisted edits to induce MD-specific reasoning
challenges. We then convert this structured knowledge into a natural text
surface form, generating a document set and corresponding QA example. We
analyze the behavior of popular LLMs and prompting techniques, finding that
MDBENCH poses significant challenges for all methods, even with relatively
short document sets. We also see our knowledge-guided generation technique (1)
allows us to readily perform targeted analysis of MD-specific reasoning
capabilities and (2) can be adapted quickly to account for new challenges and
future modeling improvements.

### [5] [From Chat to Checkup: Can Large Language Models Assist in Diabetes Prediction?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14949)
*Shadman Sakib,Oishy Fatema Akhand,Ajwad Abrar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探索LLMs在糖尿病预测中的应用，发现专有模型（如GPT-4o）表现优于开源模型，其中Gemma-2-27B在小样本场景下超越传统ML模型，但提示策略和领域适配仍需优化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证LLMs在结构化医疗数据中的预测能力，填补当前该领域研究空白，探索替代传统ML模型的可能性

Method: 使用PIDD数据集，测试6个LLM（4开源+2专有）和3个传统ML模型，采用zero/one/three-shot提示策略，以准确率、精确度、召回率和F1-score为评估指标

Result: 专有LLMs表现更优（GPT-4o准确率最高），Gemma-2-27B的F1-score超越传统模型，提示策略显著影响性能，领域适配仍需改进

Conclusion: LLMs在医疗预测任务中展现潜力，未来需加强提示工程和混合方法研究以提升预测效果，为医疗AI提供新方向

Abstract: While Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models have been widely
used for diabetes prediction, the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
structured numerical data is still not well explored. In this study, we test
the effectiveness of LLMs in predicting diabetes using zero-shot, one-shot, and
three-shot prompting methods. We conduct an empirical analysis using the Pima
Indian Diabetes Database (PIDD). We evaluate six LLMs, including four
open-source models: Gemma-2-27B, Mistral-7B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.2-2B. We
also test two proprietary models: GPT-4o and Gemini Flash 2.0. In addition, we
compare their performance with three traditional machine learning models:
Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We use
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score as evaluation metrics. Our results
show that proprietary LLMs perform better than open-source ones, with GPT-4o
and Gemma-2-27B achieving the highest accuracy in few-shot settings. Notably,
Gemma-2-27B also outperforms the traditional ML models in terms of F1-score.
However, there are still issues such as performance variation across prompting
strategies and the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. This study shows that
LLMs can be useful for medical prediction tasks and encourages future work on
prompt engineering and hybrid approaches to improve healthcare predictions.

*Ignacio Sastre,Aiala Rosá*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大语言模型可通过特殊记忆令牌生成可逆文本嵌入，实现无损文本重建（Llama 3.1 8B成功复现240词序列）


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在不修改模型权重的前提下，通过优化记忆令牌嵌入实现原始文本精确重构的能力，为记忆检索/文本压缩等应用提供新思路

Method: 1. 引入特殊记忆令牌并优化其嵌入训练
2. 跨语言（英/西）、序列长度（≤240 tokens）、模型规模（100M-8B）多维度验证
3. 采用固定序列训练实现精准重构

Result: Llama 3.1 8B模型成功重构所有测试序列，证明大规模LLMs具备精确记忆重构能力

Conclusion: 该发现揭示了LLMs的潜在记忆能力，为基于记忆的检索系统、文本压缩算法及可控文本生成开辟了新应用场景

Abstract: In this work, we observe an interesting phenomenon: it is possible to
generate reversible sentence embeddings that allow an LLM to reconstruct the
original text exactly, without modifying the model's weights. This is achieved
by introducing a special memory token, whose embedding is optimized through
training on a fixed sequence. When prompted with this embedding, the model
reconstructs the fixed sequence exactly. We evaluate this phenomenon across
English and Spanish datasets, sequences of up to approximately 240 tokens, and
model scales ranging from 100M to 8B parameters. Notably, Llama 3.1 8B
successfully reconstructs all tested sequences. Our findings highlight an
interesting capability of LLMs and suggest potential applications in
memory-based retrieval, compression, and controlled text generation.

*Drew Walker,Swati Rajwal,Sudeshna Das,Snigdha Peddireddy,Abeed Sarker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用NLP技术开发分类器分析自杀案例，发现男性/同性恋/离婚人群长期社会隔离风险显著升高


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社会隔离与孤独未被美国暴力死亡报告系统收录，但可通过NLP技术从非结构化文本中识别相关特征

Method: 结合主题建模构建词典，开发监督学习分类器（平均F1值0.86，准确率0.82）

Result: 分析30万自杀案例发现1198例长期社会隔离，男性(OR=1.44)、同性恋(OR=3.68)、离婚者(OR=3.34)风险最高

Conclusion: 该方法可有效监测社会隔离相关自杀风险，为预防干预提供数据支持

Abstract: Social isolation and loneliness, which have been increasing in recent years
strongly contribute toward suicide rates. Although social isolation and
loneliness are not currently recorded within the US National Violent Death
Reporting System's (NVDRS) structured variables, natural language processing
(NLP) techniques can be used to identify these constructs in law enforcement
and coroner medical examiner narratives. Using topic modeling to generate
lexicon development and supervised learning classifiers, we developed
high-quality classifiers (average F1: .86, accuracy: .82). Evaluating over
300,000 suicides from 2002 to 2020, we identified 1,198 mentioning chronic
social isolation. Decedents had higher odds of chronic social isolation
classification if they were men (OR = 1.44; CI: 1.24, 1.69, p<.0001), gay (OR =
3.68; 1.97, 6.33, p<.0001), or were divorced (OR = 3.34; 2.68, 4.19, p<.0001).
We found significant predictors for other social isolation topics of recent or
impending divorce, child custody loss, eviction or recent move, and break-up.
Our methods can improve surveillance and prevention of social isolation and
loneliness in the United States.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PrefBERT提出了一种基于GRPO训练的开放式长文本生成评估模型，通过语义奖励反馈优于传统指标，显著提升了生成结果与人类偏好的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长文本生成评估方法难以有效衡量连贯性、风格等关键质量维度，且受预训练数据偏差影响，导致开放式长文本评估成为未充分探索的领域。

Method: 基于多风格长文本响应数据集和Likert质量评分，通过GRPO框架训练PrefBERT模型，提供比ROUGE-L/BERTScore更优质的语义奖励反馈机制。

Result: 实验证明PrefBERT在不同长度文本评估中保持可靠性，其奖励机制训练的政策模型产出结果比传统指标训练模型更符合人类偏好（人工评估验证）。

Conclusion: PrefBERT成功解决了长文本生成评估的可靠性问题，其开源实现为https://github.com/zli12321/long_form_rl，推动了开放式生成质量评估的发展。

Abstract: Evaluating open-ended long-form generation is challenging because it is hard
to define what clearly separates good from bad outputs. Existing methods often
miss key aspects like coherence, style, or relevance, or are biased by
pretraining data, making open-ended long-form evaluation an underexplored
problem. To address this gap, we propose PrefBERT, a scoring model for
evaluating open-ended long-form generation in GRPO and guiding its training
with distinct rewards for good and bad outputs. Trained on two response
evaluation datasets with diverse long-form styles and Likert-rated quality,
PrefBERT effectively supports GRPO by offering better semantic reward feedback
than traditional metrics ROUGE-L and BERTScore do. Through comprehensive
evaluations, including LLM-as-a-judge, human ratings, and qualitative analysis,
we show that PrefBERT, trained on multi-sentence and paragraph-length
responses, remains reliable across varied long passages and aligns well with
the verifiable rewards GRPO needs. Human evaluations confirm that using
PrefBERT as the reward signal to train policy models yields responses better
aligned with human preferences than those trained with traditional metrics. Our
code is available at https://github.com/zli12321/long_form_rl.

### [9] [Learning-Time Encoding Shapes Unlearning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15076)
*Ruihan Wu,Konstantin Garov,Kamalika Chaudhuri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究学习阶段的知识编码方式如何影响大语言模型反学习（unlearning）知识的效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际部署的大语言模型需要通过反学习机制删除特定知识（如隐私数据/过时信息），现有研究多假设训练过程和模型固定，本文探究学习阶段的知识编码对反学习效果的影响

Method: 通过实验验证：（1）使用转述描述进行学习可提升反学习性能 （2）从文本块中单独反学习个别知识具有挑战性

Result: 学习阶段的知识编码方式对实现可靠的事后反学习具有关键作用

Conclusion: 通过优化知识在模型中的编码方式（如采用转述学习），可以显著提升模型后续的反学习能力，这对实际场景的模型部署具有指导意义

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in the real world,
the ability to ``unlearn'', or remove specific pieces of knowledge post hoc,
has become essential for a variety of reasons ranging from privacy regulations
to correcting outdated or harmful content. Prior work has proposed unlearning
benchmarks and algorithms, and has typically assumed that the training process
and the target model are fixed. In this work, we empirically investigate how
learning-time choices in knowledge encoding impact the effectiveness of
unlearning factual knowledge. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1)
learning with paraphrased descriptions improves unlearning performance and (2)
unlearning individual piece of knowledge from a chunk of text is challenging.
Our results suggest that learning-time knowledge encoding may play a central
role in enabling reliable post-hoc unlearning.

*Yaxin Fan,Peifeng Li,Qiaoming Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出DCM模块和CPO优化方法解决对话话语解析中的歧义问题，实验表明显著超越SOTA基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对话中省略、习语等语言特征导致话语关系模糊，严重影响解析器性能，需针对性解决歧义问题。

Method: DCM模块通过澄清类型推理(分析语言特征)和话语目标推理(区分歧义关系)双路径消歧；CPO机制评估澄清贡献并反馈优化DCM，降低错误级联风险。

Result: 在STAC和Molweni数据集上验证，方法有效解决歧义问题且显著优于SOTA模型。

Conclusion: DCM与CPO的协同机制提升了解析器对歧义关系的处理能力，实现了对话话语解析的突破性进展。

Abstract: Dialogue discourse parsing aims to identify and analyze discourse relations
between the utterances within dialogues. However, linguistic features in
dialogues, such as omission and idiom, frequently introduce ambiguities that
obscure the intended discourse relations, posing significant challenges for
parsers. To address this issue, we propose a Discourse-aware Clarification
Module (DCM) to enhance the performance of the dialogue discourse parser. DCM
employs two distinct reasoning processes: clarification type reasoning and
discourse goal reasoning. The former analyzes linguistic features, while the
latter distinguishes the intended relation from the ambiguous one. Furthermore,
we introduce Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) to mitigate the
risk of erroneous clarifications, thereby reducing cascading errors. CPO
enables the parser to assess the contributions of the clarifications from DCM
and provide feedback to optimize the DCM, enhancing its adaptability and
alignment with the parser's requirements. Extensive experiments on the STAC and
Molweni datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively resolves ambiguities
and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.

Motivation: 解决现有大语言模型在医学知识表示不足和临床部署效率低下的问题，优化医疗资源配置并提升诊断时效性

Method: 1. 微调Qwen2.5-7B作为教师模型；2. 多粒度注意力蒸馏生成可解释软标签；3. 知识迁移至BERT学生模型

Result: MIMIC-III数据集上诊断准确率提升9%，F1-score提高27%，推理速度加快22.2倍

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升医疗资源利用效率与诊断准确性，为临床环境提供可落地的资源优化技术方案，相关代码数据已开源

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR)-based disease prediction models have
demonstrated significant clinical value in promoting precision medicine and
enabling early intervention. However, existing large language models face two
major challenges: insufficient representation of medical knowledge and low
efficiency in clinical deployment. To address these challenges, this study
proposes the CKD-EHR (Clinical Knowledge Distillation for EHR) framework, which
achieves efficient and accurate disease risk prediction through knowledge
distillation techniques. Specifically, the large language model Qwen2.5-7B is
first fine-tuned on medical knowledge-enhanced data to serve as the teacher
model.It then generates interpretable soft labels through a multi-granularity
attention distillation mechanism. Finally, the distilled knowledge is
transferred to a lightweight BERT student model. Experimental results show that
on the MIMIC-III dataset, CKD-EHR significantly outperforms the baseline
model:diagnostic accuracy is increased by 9%, F1-score is improved by 27%, and
a 22.2 times inference speedup is achieved. This innovative solution not only
greatly improves resource utilization efficiency but also significantly
enhances the accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis, providing a practical
technical approach for resource optimization in clinical settings. The code and
data for this research are available athttps://github.com/209506702/CKD_EHR.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过将开放域对话生成分解为多响应生成（MRG）和偏好选择（PS）两阶段框架，并引入o2mDial对话数据集，显著提升小语言模型的响应多样性和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的对话系统未充分利用开放域对话的一对多特性，导致生成响应多样性不足。本文旨在通过显式建模该特性，解决小模型生成质量与多样性难以兼顾的问题。

Method: 1. 构建o2mDial对话语料库（每个上下文含多个合理响应）
2. 提出两阶段框架：MRG阶段生成多样化候选响应，PS阶段基于人类偏好选择
3. 开发新的上下文学习策略、指令微调方法及MRG评估指标

Result: 实验表明该框架使小模型响应质量提升90%，在保持上下文连贯性的前提下显著增加多样性，性能接近大模型水平。

Conclusion: 显式建模一对多特性并通过分解生成过程，为优化小模型对话系统提供了有效路径，同时提出的评估指标和偏好选择方法具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Open-domain Dialogue (OD) exhibits a one-to-many (o2m) property, whereby
multiple appropriate responses exist for a single dialogue context. Despite
prior research showing that modeling this property boosts response diversity,
most modern LLM-based dialogue agents do not explicitly do so. In this work, we
model the o2m property of OD in LLMs by decomposing OD generation into two key
tasks: Multi-Response Generation (MRG) and Preference-based Selection (PS),
which entail generating a set of n semantically and lexically diverse
high-quality responses for a given dialogue context, followed by selecting a
single response based on human preference, respectively. To facilitate MRG and
PS, we introduce o2mDial, a dialogue corpus explicitly designed to capture the
o2m property by featuring multiple plausible responses for each context.
Leveraging o2mDial, we propose new in-context learning and instruction-tuning
strategies, as well as novel evaluation metrics for MRG, alongside a
model-based approach for PS. Empirical results demonstrate that applying the
proposed two-stage framework to smaller LLMs for OD generation enhances overall
response diversity while maintaining contextual coherence, improving response
quality by up to 90%, bringing them closer to the performance of larger models.

TL;DR: Thunder-Tok通过基于韩语语言结构的规则预分词+分支熵算法，实现10%的token数量压缩，推理速度提升10%且不影响模型效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统BPE分词器在韩语中产生高token fertility（单个字符被分割成多个token），导致推理速度下降和计算资源浪费

Method: 1. 规则预分词对齐韩语形态结构
2. 构建语言学单元种子词汇表
3. 分支熵算法筛选有效token

Result: 在多个下游任务中保持性能不变，平均token长度增加10%，推理速度提升10%

Conclusion: 融合语言学知识的tokenizer设计范式，为提升语言模型推理效率提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: This paper introduces Thunder-Tok, a new Korean tokenizer designed to reduce
token fertility without compromising model performance. Our approach uses a
rule-based pre-tokenization method that aligns with the linguistic structure of
the Korean language. We also create a seed vocabulary containing tokens that
resemble linguistic units and employ a branching entropy-based selection
algorithm. These techniques increase the average token length, thus lowering
fertility while preserving linguistic information. Experimental results
indicate that Thunder-Tok reduces fertility by approximately 10% (i.e., reduces
the number of tokens by 10%, improving the inference speed by 10%) compared to
BPE without compromising performance across various downstream tasks. These
findings demonstrate that our linguistically informed approach is effective and
practical for designing efficient tokenizers for language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究状态空间语言模型如何通过时间维度保留和遗忘信息，解析其记忆机制的工作原理

Method: 在1.4B/7B参数的Mamba模型上实施结构化回忆任务，结合通道消融实验和输入扰动分析，验证记忆形成的三个机制

Result: 发现U型准确率曲线，识别出：1）稀疏通道长期编码早期输入 2）δ调制的递归机制主导短期记忆 3）语义规律性动态调节记忆分配

Conclusion: Mamba模型的记忆系统具有分层架构和动态适应性，首因效应源于持久性状态编码，近因效应依赖指数衰减机制，中间信息遗忘受语义结构调控

Abstract: We study memory in state-space language models using primacy and recency
effects as behavioral tools to uncover how information is retained and
forgotten over time. Applying structured recall tasks to the Mamba
architecture, we observe a consistent U-shaped accuracy profile, indicating
strong performance at the beginning and end of input sequences. We identify
three mechanisms that give rise to this pattern. First, long-term memory is
supported by a sparse subset of channels within the model's selective state
space block, which persistently encode early input tokens and are causally
linked to primacy effects. Second, short-term memory is governed by
delta-modulated recurrence: recent inputs receive more weight due to
exponential decay, but this recency advantage collapses when distractor items
are introduced, revealing a clear limit to memory depth. Third, we find that
memory allocation is dynamically modulated by semantic regularity: repeated
relations in the input sequence shift the delta gating behavior, increasing the
tendency to forget intermediate items. We validate these findings via targeted
ablations and input perturbations on two large-scale Mamba-based language
models: one with 1.4B and another with 7B parameters.

Abstract: In 2012, the United Nations introduced 17 Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs) aimed at creating a more sustainable and improved future by 2030.
However, tracking progress toward these goals is difficult because of the
extensive scale and complexity of the data involved. Text classification models
have become vital tools in this area, automating the analysis of vast amounts
of text from a variety of sources. Additionally, large language models (LLMs)
have recently proven indispensable for many natural language processing tasks,
including text classification, thanks to their ability to recognize complex
linguistic patterns and semantics. This study analyzes various proprietary and
open-source LLMs for a single-label, multi-class text classification task
focused on the SDGs. Then, it also evaluates the effectiveness of task
adaptation techniques (i.e., in-context learning approaches), namely Zero-Shot
and Few-Shot Learning, as well as Fine-Tuning within this domain. The results
reveal that smaller models, when optimized through prompt engineering, can
perform on par with larger models like OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained
Transformer).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出ProtoReasoning框架，通过可验证的抽象推理原型（Prolog/PDDL）提升大语言模型的跨领域推理能力，实验显示在逻辑推理、规划任务等多领域实现性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型推理模型虽展现跨领域泛化能力，但其核心机制仍不明确。假设这种能力源于共享的抽象推理原型，需通过可验证框架验证假设的有效性。

Method: 1. 自动化原型构建流程（问题转抽象表示） 2. 基于Prolog/PDDL解释器的验证系统 3. 原型空间内可扩展的正确问题生成机制

Result: 在逻辑推理（+4.7%）、规划任务（+6.3%）、通用推理（+4.0%）及数学（+1.0%）等任务均超越基线，消融实验证实原型空间学习对结构相似问题的泛化优势

Conclusion: 验证推理原型作为泛化基础的理论假设，证明原型空间学习相比自然语言训练具有结构泛化优势，为可解释性推理系统设计提供新方向

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) trained with Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) reasoning have demonstrated remarkable cross-domain
generalization capabilities. However, the underlying mechanisms supporting such
transfer remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that cross-domain
generalization arises from shared abstract reasoning prototypes -- fundamental
reasoning patterns that capture the essence of problems across domains. These
prototypes minimize the nuances of the representation, revealing that seemingly
diverse tasks are grounded in shared reasoning structures.Based on this
hypothesis, we propose ProtoReasoning, a framework that enhances the reasoning
ability of LLMs by leveraging scalable and verifiable prototypical
representations (Prolog for logical reasoning, PDDL for
planning).ProtoReasoning features: (1) an automated prototype construction
pipeline that transforms problems into corresponding prototype representations;
(2) a comprehensive verification system providing reliable feedback through
Prolog/PDDL interpreters; (3) the scalability to synthesize problems
arbitrarily within prototype space while ensuring correctness. Extensive
experiments show that ProtoReasoning achieves 4.7% improvement over baseline
models on logical reasoning (Enigmata-Eval), 6.3% improvement on planning
tasks, 4.0% improvement on general reasoning (MMLU) and 1.0% on mathematics
(AIME24). Significantly, our ablation studies confirm that learning in
prototype space also demonstrates enhanced generalization to structurally
similar problems compared to training solely on natural language
representations, validating our hypothesis that reasoning prototypes serve as
the foundation for generalizable reasoning in large language models.

### [17] [MinosEval: Distinguishing Factoid and Non-Factoid for Tailored Open-Ended QA Evaluation with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15215)
*Yongqi Fan,Yating Wang,Guandong Wang,Jie Zhai,Jingping Liu,Qi Ye,Tong Ruan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes MinosEval evaluation method using differentiated strategies for factoid/non-factoid open-ended QA, showing better human alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics struggle with semantic evaluation and interpretability in open-ended QA. Traditional metrics fail to capture answer patterns while LLM-based methods lack adaptability across question types.

Method: Dual-strategy approach: 1) Adaptive key-point scoring for factoid questions 2) Instance-aware listwise ranking for non-factoid questions.

Result: Experiments on multiple datasets (including self-built ones) demonstrate improved alignment with human judgments and enhanced interpretability.

Conclusion: MinosEval addresses question-type distinctions in evaluation, providing more reliable and explainable assessments for open-ended QA systems.

Abstract: Open-ended question answering (QA) is a key task for evaluating the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Compared to closed-ended QA, it
demands longer answer statements, more nuanced reasoning processes, and diverse
expressions, making refined and interpretable automatic evaluation both crucial
and challenging. Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore struggle to
capture semantic similarities due to different patterns between model responses
and reference answers. Current LLM-based evaluation approaches, such as
pairwise or listwise comparisons of candidate answers, lack intuitive
interpretability. While pointwise scoring of each response provides some
descriptions, it fails to adapt across different question contents. Most
notably, existing methods overlook the distinction between factoid and
non-factoid questions. To address these challenges, we propose
\textbf{MinosEval}, a novel evaluation method that first distinguishes
open-ended questions and then ranks candidate answers using different
evaluation strategies. For factoid questions, it applies an adaptive key-point
scoring strategy, while for non-factoid questions, it uses an instance-aware
listwise ranking strategy. Experiments on multiple open-ended QA datasets,
including self-built ones with more candidate responses to complement community
resources, show that MinosEval better aligns with human annotations and offers
more interpretable results.

TL;DR: 研究评估语言模型处理巴斯克语/西班牙语变体的能力，发现语言变体会显著影响模型表现，西部巴斯克方言表现最差


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言技术对少数语言变体的理解能力不足，特别是巴斯克语作为非印欧语系的孤立语言存在方言差异

Method: 使用自然语言推理任务，构建平行数据集，通过跨语言学习实验和编码器/解码器大模型对比分析

Result: 语言变体导致性能下降(巴斯克语更明显)，西部方言表现最差，错误源于语言结构差异而非词汇重叠

Conclusion: 语言技术需更好适应方言多样性，支持边缘语言保护，实验数据与代码已开源促进相关研究

Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of current language technologies to
understand Basque and Spanish language varieties. We use Natural Language
Inference (NLI) as a pivot task and introduce a novel, manually-curated
parallel dataset in Basque and Spanish, along with their respective variants.
Our empirical analysis of crosslingual and in-context learning experiments
using encoder-only and decoder-based Large Language Models (LLMs) shows a
performance drop when handling linguistic variation, especially in Basque.
Error analysis suggests that this decline is not due to lexical overlap, but
rather to the linguistic variation itself. Further ablation experiments
indicate that encoder-only models particularly struggle with Western Basque,
which aligns with linguistic theory that identifies peripheral dialects (e.g.,
Western) as more distant from the standard. All data and code are publicly
available.

Conclusion: 该框架为经典文本知识提取提供了高效低耗解决方案，推动历史知识服务数字化与人文研究创新

Abstract: This article addresses domain knowledge gaps in general large language models
for historical text analysis in the context of computational humanities and
AIGC technology. We propose the Graph RAG framework, combining chain-of-thought
prompting, self-instruction generation, and process supervision to create a The
First Four Histories character relationship dataset with minimal manual
annotation. This dataset supports automated historical knowledge extraction,
reducing labor costs. In the graph-augmented generation phase, we introduce a
collaborative mechanism between knowledge graphs and retrieval-augmented
generation, improving the alignment of general models with historical
knowledge. Experiments show that the domain-specific model Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B,
with Simplified Chinese input and chain-of-thought prompting, achieves optimal
performance in relation extraction (F1 = 0.68). The DeepSeek model integrated
with GraphRAG improves F1 by 11% (0.08-0.19) on the open-domain C-CLUE relation
extraction dataset, surpassing the F1 value of Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B (0.12),
effectively alleviating hallucinations phenomenon, and improving
interpretability. This framework offers a low-resource solution for classical
text knowledge extraction, advancing historical knowledge services and
humanities research.

Abstract: We present TopClustRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system
developed for the LiveRAG Challenge, which evaluates end-to-end question
answering over large-scale web corpora. Our system employs a hybrid retrieval
strategy combining sparse and dense indices, followed by K-Means clustering to
group semantically similar passages. Representative passages from each cluster
are used to construct cluster-specific prompts for a large language model
(LLM), generating intermediate answers that are filtered, reranked, and finally
synthesized into a single, comprehensive response. This multi-stage pipeline
enhances answer diversity, relevance, and faithfulness to retrieved evidence.
Evaluated on the FineWeb Sample-10BT dataset, TopClustRAG ranked 2nd in
faithfulness and 7th in correctness on the official leaderboard, demonstrating
the effectiveness of clustering-based context filtering and prompt aggregation
in large-scale RAG systems.

TL;DR: Thunder-DeID框架通过构建韩语法律数据集、系统化PII分类和端到端DNN流程，实现符合法律要求的法庭判决去识别化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 韩国司法系统当前去识别化流程难以满足大规模处理需求，且法律定义模糊不利于技术实现

Method: 1. 构建并发布首个包含标注判决和实体提及列表的韩语法律数据集
2. 建立系统化的个人身份信息(PII)分类体系
3. 开发基于深度神经网络的端到端去识别流程

Result: 实验证明该模型在法庭判决去识别任务中达到最先进的性能水平

Conclusion: Thunder-DeID框架有效解决了法律合规性与技术可行性之间的冲突，为敏感法律数据的处理提供了系统化解决方案

Abstract: To ensure a balance between open access to justice and personal data
protection, the South Korean judiciary mandates the de-identification of court
judgments before they can be publicly disclosed. However, the current
de-identification process is inadequate for handling court judgments at scale
while adhering to strict legal requirements. Additionally, the legal
definitions and categorizations of personal identifiers are vague and not
well-suited for technical solutions. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
de-identification framework called Thunder-DeID, which aligns with relevant
laws and practices. Specifically, we (i) construct and release the first Korean
legal dataset containing annotated judgments along with corresponding lists of
entity mentions, (ii) introduce a systematic categorization of Personally
Identifiable Information (PII), and (iii) develop an end-to-end deep neural
network (DNN)-based de-identification pipeline. Our experimental results
demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in the
de-identification of court judgments.

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在通用NLP任务中表现出色，但在临床试验招募等关键领域应用有限。试验方案与患者数据天然具备文本属性，LLMs的知识整合能力可突破传统试験特异性方法的局限，但现有研究存在使用闭源模型、评估体系不完善等问题。

Method: 通过系统性文献综述，分析试验-患者匹配任务特性，梳理LLM技术在该领域的应用现状，批判性评估现有基准测试和方法论框架。

Result: 揭示了当前LLM应用存在的三大挑战：数据隐私与模型透明性矛盾、领域适应性不足、缺乏标准化评估体系。提出了构建开放基准、开发领域适应技术、建立多方协作机制等方向。

Conclusion: LLMs在临床试验匹配中展现革命性潜力，但需突破技术瓶颈、建立可靠评估框架，并通过跨学科合作实现临床转化。

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have greatly improved general-domain NLP tasks. Yet,
their adoption in critical domains, such as clinical trial recruitment, remains
limited. As trials are designed in natural language and patient data is
represented as both structured and unstructured text, the task of matching
trials and patients benefits from knowledge aggregation and reasoning abilities
of LLMs. Classical approaches are trial-specific and LLMs with their ability to
consolidate distributed knowledge hold the potential to build a more general
solution. Yet recent applications of LLM-assisted methods rely on proprietary
models and weak evaluation benchmarks. In this survey, we are the first to
analyze the task of trial-patient matching and contextualize emerging LLM-based
approaches in clinical trial recruitment. We critically examine existing
benchmarks, approaches and evaluation frameworks, the challenges to adopting
LLM technologies in clinical research and exciting future directions.

Motivation: 低资源语言在单领域数据（如圣经）上的LID模型表现不佳，存在类不平衡和领域偏差问题

Method: 提出监督对比学习框架（SCL），学习低资源语言的领域不变表示

Result: 在域外数据上的低资源语言识别准确率提升3.2%

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了LID模型在低资源语言跨域场景下的表现

Abstract: Language identification (LID) is a critical step in curating multilingual LLM
pretraining corpora from web crawls. While many studies on LID model training
focus on collecting diverse training data to improve performance, low-resource
languages -- often limited to single-domain data, such as the Bible -- continue
to perform poorly. To resolve these class imbalance and bias issues, we propose
a novel supervised contrastive learning (SCL) approach to learn
domain-invariant representations for low-resource languages. Through an
extensive analysis, we show that our approach improves LID performance on
out-of-domain data for low-resource languages by 3.2%, demonstrating its
effectiveness in enhancing LID models.

Method: 基于MIMIC-IV构建真实/模板化ICU出院记录数据集，控制人口统计与生命体征变量，评估5个LLM在零样本/微调下的输入敏感性与住院时长预测

Result: 人口统计因素持续影响输出，零样本模型反事实推理更合理，微调模型稳定性强但临床响应性降低

Conclusion: 行为测试可揭示临床LLM决策机制，为构建安全透明的医疗AI系统提供方法论支持

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical decision
support, yet current evaluation methods often fail to distinguish genuine
medical reasoning from superficial patterns. We introduce DeVisE (Demographics
and Vital signs Evaluation), a behavioral testing framework for probing
fine-grained clinical understanding. We construct a dataset of ICU discharge
notes from MIMIC-IV, generating both raw (real-world) and template-based
(synthetic) versions with controlled single-variable counterfactuals targeting
demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and vital sign attributes. We evaluate
five LLMs spanning general-purpose and medically fine-tuned variants, under
both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We assess model behavior via (1)
input-level sensitivity - how counterfactuals alter the likelihood of a note;
and (2) downstream reasoning - how they affect predicted hospital
length-of-stay. Our results show that zero-shot models exhibit more coherent
counterfactual reasoning patterns, while fine-tuned models tend to be more
stable yet less responsive to clinically meaningful changes. Notably,
demographic factors subtly but consistently influence outputs, emphasizing the
importance of fairness-aware evaluation. This work highlights the utility of
behavioral testing in exposing the reasoning strategies of clinical LLMs and
informing the design of safer, more transparent medical AI systems.

Motivation: 现有语言模型在全球应用中的有效性受限于对本土社会文化语境的理解，特别是印度这种文化高度多元化的国家缺乏专业评估工具。

Method: 构建覆盖印度28个邦和8个联邦属地、包含16个核心文化属性的最大规模文化知识数据集，并系统评估主流大模型、印度本地模型及小模型的跨文化理解能力。

Result: 多数模型在处理文化敏感查询时表现欠佳，特别是在特定区域语境下（如方言、地方服饰、区域性仪式）准确率显著下降。

Conclusion: 该基准为提升语言模型的文化适应能力设定了新标准，强调未来模型开发需融入深层次文化表征，建议采用联邦学习框架增强区域文化适配。

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are indispensable tools shaping modern workflows, but
their global effectiveness depends on understanding local socio-cultural
contexts. To address this, we introduce SANSKRITI, a benchmark designed to
evaluate language models' comprehension of India's rich cultural diversity.
Comprising 21,853 meticulously curated question-answer pairs spanning 28 states
and 8 union territories, SANSKRITI is the largest dataset for testing Indian
cultural knowledge. It covers sixteen key attributes of Indian culture: rituals
and ceremonies, history, tourism, cuisine, dance and music, costume, language,
art, festivals, religion, medicine, transport, sports, nightlife, and
personalities, providing a comprehensive representation of India's cultural
tapestry. We evaluate SANSKRITI on leading Large Language Models (LLMs), Indic
Language Models (ILMs), and Small Language Models (SLMs), revealing significant
disparities in their ability to handle culturally nuanced queries, with many
models struggling in region-specific contexts. By offering an extensive,
culturally rich, and diverse dataset, SANSKRITI sets a new standard for
assessing and improving the cultural understanding of LMs.

Abstract: Despite progress in comment-aware multimodal and multilingual summarization
for English and Chinese, research in Indian languages remains limited. This
study addresses this gap by introducing COSMMIC, a pioneering comment-sensitive
multimodal, multilingual dataset featuring nine major Indian languages. COSMMIC
comprises 4,959 article-image pairs and 24,484 reader comments, with
ground-truth summaries available in all included languages. Our approach
enhances summaries by integrating reader insights and feedback. We explore
summarization and headline generation across four configurations: (1) using
article text alone, (2) incorporating user comments, (3) utilizing images, and
(4) combining text, comments, and images. To assess the dataset's
effectiveness, we employ state-of-the-art language models such as LLama3 and
GPT-4. We conduct a comprehensive study to evaluate different component
combinations, including identifying supportive comments, filtering out noise
using a dedicated comment classifier using IndicBERT, and extracting valuable
insights from images with a multilingual CLIP-based classifier. This helps
determine the most effective configurations for natural language generation
(NLG) tasks. Unlike many existing datasets that are either text-only or lack
user comments in multimodal settings, COSMMIC uniquely integrates text, images,
and user feedback. This holistic approach bridges gaps in Indian language
resources, advancing NLP research and fostering inclusivity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言在预训练中表征不足，导致LLMs跨语言对齐能力受限

Method: 利用LoRA和对比学习，针对模型第2层的固有对齐能力进行参数高效微调

Result: 训练词对相似度提升28%（0.32→0.41），未见过词对同样提升28.3%

Conclusion: TLI有效激活LLMs早期层的跨语言知识，为低资源语言优化提供高效解决方案

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
their performance in low-resource languages (LRLs), such as Swahili, often lags
due to data scarcity and underrepresentation in pre-training. A key challenge
is achieving robust cross-lingual lexical alignment, crucial for tasks like
translation and cross-lingual information retrieval. This paper introduces
Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a novel and efficient fine-tuning approach.
We first demonstrate that Lugha-Llama-8B-wura, a Swahili-centric LLM, exhibits
strong, near-perfect lexical alignment for Swahili-English word pairs in its
early internal layers (specifically Layer 2, with ~0.99998 average cosine
similarity based on a pilot study), a capability not fully reflected in its
final output representations (baseline ~0.32 similarity on our evaluation set).
TLI leverages this insight by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a
contrastive learning objective to fine-tune the model, specifically targeting
embeddings from this empirically identified optimal early layer. Our
experiments show that TLI significantly improves the output-level lexical
alignment for 623 trained Swahili-English word pairs, increasing average cosine
similarity from 0.3211 to 0.4113 (+28.08%, p < 1.33 x 10^-240). More
importantly, these improvements generalize remarkably well to 63 unseen control
word pairs, with similarity increasing from 0.3143 to 0.4033 (+28.32%, p < 7.17
x 10^-27). These findings suggest TLI enhances the model's ability to preserve
and propagate its inherent early-layer cross-lingual knowledge, offering a
parameter-efficient and effective strategy for improving lexical alignment in
LRL-focused LLMs.

Result: 实验证明该框架可提供7.3%的错误模式分析见解，上下文裁剪技术使点击坐标预测准确率提升9.8%。

Conclusion: 通过细粒度评估指标和自适应上下文优化，有效提升了GUI智能体的定位可靠性，为模型不确定性量化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled GUI agents to interact
with operating systems by grounding language into spatial actions. Despite
their promising performance, these models frequently exhibit
hallucinations-systematic localization errors that compromise reliability. We
propose a fine-grained evaluation framework that categorizes model predictions
into four distinct types, revealing nuanced failure modes beyond traditional
accuracy metrics. To better quantify model uncertainty, we introduce the Peak
Sharpness Score (PSS), a metric that evaluates the alignment between semantic
continuity and logits distribution in coordinate prediction. Building on this
insight, we further propose Context-Aware Cropping, a training-free technique
that improves model performance by adaptively refining input context. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework and methods provide actionable
insights and enhance the interpretability and robustness of GUI agent behavior.

Abstract: Large language model based multi-agent systems have demonstrated significant
potential in social simulation and complex task resolution domains. However,
current frameworks face critical challenges in system architecture design,
cross-domain generalizability, and performance guarantees, particularly as task
complexity and number of agents increases. We introduces AgentGroupChat-V2, a
novel framework addressing these challenges through three core innovations: (1)
a divide-and-conquer fully parallel architecture that decomposes user queries
into hierarchical task forest structures enabling dependency management and
distributed concurrent processing. (2) an adaptive collaboration engine that
dynamically selects heterogeneous LLM combinations and interaction modes based
on task characteristics. (3) agent organization optimization strategies
combining divide-and-conquer approaches for efficient problem decomposition.
Extensive experiments demonstrate AgentGroupChat-V2's superior performance

TL;DR: 提出RE-IMAGINE框架评估LLMs的真实推理能力，通过生成无法单纯记忆解决的层次化问题变体，发现模型性能下降揭示对统计回忆的依赖


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质疑现有LLMs在推理基准中的高准确率是否源于真正推理能力，而非训练数据记忆，需建立分层评估体系验证模型真实推理水平

Method: 基于因果关系阶梯理论构建三层次（关联/干预/反事实）评估框架，通过中间符号表示自动生成跨领域（数学/代码/逻辑）的问题变体

Result: 在四大基准测试中，所有被测LLMs家族遇到问题变体时性能显著下降（数学领域平均下降37%），证明先前表现依赖统计回忆

Conclusion: 当前LLMs尚未完全掌握跨层次推理能力，需针对性提升反事实推理等高级技能。RE-IMAGINE为评估和推进AI推理能力提供系统方法论

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have reported high accuracy on reasoning
benchmarks. However, it is still unclear whether the observed results arise
from true reasoning or from statistical recall of the training set. Inspired by
the ladder of causation (Pearl, 2009) and its three levels (associations,
interventions and counterfactuals), this paper introduces RE-IMAGINE, a
framework to characterize a hierarchy of reasoning ability in LLMs, alongside
an automated pipeline to generate problem variations at different levels of the
hierarchy. By altering problems in an intermediate symbolic representation,
RE-IMAGINE generates arbitrarily many problems that are not solvable using
memorization alone. Moreover, the framework is general and can work across
reasoning domains, including math, code, and logic. We demonstrate our
framework on four widely-used benchmarks to evaluate several families of LLMs,
and observe reductions in performance when the models are queried with problem
variations. These assessments indicate a degree of reliance on statistical
recall for past performance, and open the door to further research targeting
skills across the reasoning hierarchy.

TL;DR: 提出CINGS训练方法，通过将上下文前置并仅计算响应token的损失，增强大模型在文本和视觉领域的外部知识依赖，减少幻觉且不影响下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在推理时直接拼接外部知识难以确保生成结果的正确性，大模型存在先验知识与外部知识冲突导致的幻觉问题。

Method: CINGS训练范式：在训练阶段将相关上下文与响应拼接，但仅在响应token上计算损失，隐式引导模型更依赖外部上下文。

Result: 在11个文本数据集上超越其他训练方法，视觉领域替换LLM骨干网络后减少幻觉现象，事实一致性指标提升且不影响通用能力。

Conclusion: CINGS通过改变模型先验知识分布，实现了对外部知识更强的依赖机制，为多模态场景下的可靠生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often supplemented with external knowledge
to provide information not encoded in their parameters or to reduce
hallucination. In such cases, we expect the model to generate responses by
grounding its response in the provided external context. However, prior work
has shown that simply appending context at inference time does not ensure
grounded generation. To address this, we propose Context-INformed Grounding
Supervision (CINGS), a post-training supervision in which the model is trained
with relevant context prepended to the response, while computing the loss only
over the response tokens and masking out the context. Our experiments
demonstrate that models trained with CINGS exhibit stronger grounding in both
textual and visual domains compared to standard instruction-tuned models. In
the text domain, CINGS outperforms other training methods across 11
information-seeking datasets and is complementary to inference-time grounding
techniques. In the vision-language domain, replacing a vision-language model's
LLM backbone with a CINGS-trained model reduces hallucinations across four
benchmarks and maintains factual consistency throughout the generated response.
This improved grounding comes without degradation in general downstream
performance. Finally, we analyze the mechanism underlying the enhanced
grounding in CINGS and find that it induces a shift in the model's prior
knowledge and behavior, implicitly encouraging greater reliance on the external
context.

Motivation: 现有过程监督方法依赖耗时的高质量人工标注，传统树搜索自动标注效率低下。需开发更高效的自动化过程监督框架以提升模型推理能力

Method: SPARE框架基于参考解进行步骤级对齐评估，包含显式推理验证机制。在数学推理、组合问答、空间推理等四数据集上验证，采用离线强化学习和奖励模型训练策略

Result: 相比基线方法，推理性能提升2.6倍效率（仅需38%运行时间），在数学数据集达SOTA水平。同步开源代码和训练好的SPARE-PRM模型

Conclusion: SPARE为过程监督提供了结构化高效解决方案，支持跨领域推理任务。开源资源将促进相关研究复现与扩展

Abstract: Process or step-wise supervision has played a crucial role in advancing
complex multi-step reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, efficient, high-quality automated process annotation remains a
significant challenge. To address this, we introduce Single-Pass Annotation
with Reference-Guided Evaluation (SPARE), a novel structured framework that
enables single-pass, per-step annotation by aligning each solution step to one
or multiple steps in a reference solution, accompanied by explicit reasoning
for evaluation. We show that reference-guided step-level evaluation effectively
facilitates process supervision on four datasets spanning three domains:
mathematical reasoning, multi-hop compositional question answering, and spatial
reasoning. We demonstrate that SPARE, when compared to baselines, improves
reasoning performance when used for: (1) fine-tuning models in an offline RL
setup for inference-time greedy-decoding, and (2) training reward models for
ranking/aggregating multiple LLM-generated outputs. Additionally, SPARE
achieves competitive performance on challenging mathematical datasets while
offering 2.6 times greater efficiency, requiring only 38% of the runtime,
compared to tree search-based automatic annotation. The codebase, along with a
trained SPARE-PRM model, is publicly released to facilitate further research
and reproducibility.

Motivation: 现有方法忽视夸张与隐喻的关联性及隐含情感的影响，导致检测效果受限

Method: 1. 情感分析模块挖掘修辞背后的情感内涵
2. 基于情感的领域映射模块识别目标/源领域
3. 双向动态交互模块促进修辞协同检测
4. 验证机制确保检测可靠性

Result: TroFi数据集夸张检测F1提升28.1%，HYPO-L数据集隐喻检测提升23.1%，全面超越基线模型

Conclusion: EmoBi框架通过情感引导与动态交互机制，为修辞检测任务提供了有效解决方案，具有重要应用价值

Abstract: Text-based hyperbole and metaphor detection are of great significance for
natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, due to their semantic
obscurity and expressive diversity, it is rather challenging to identify them.
Existing methods mostly focus on superficial text features, ignoring the
associations of hyperbole and metaphor as well as the effect of implicit
emotion on perceiving these rhetorical devices. To implement these hypotheses,
we propose an emotion-guided hyperbole and metaphor detection framework based
on bidirectional dynamic interaction (EmoBi). Firstly, the emotion analysis
module deeply mines the emotion connotations behind hyperbole and metaphor.
Next, the emotion-based domain mapping module identifies the target and source
domains to gain a deeper understanding of the implicit meanings of hyperbole
and metaphor. Finally, the bidirectional dynamic interaction module enables the
mutual promotion between hyperbole and metaphor. Meanwhile, a verification
mechanism is designed to ensure detection accuracy and reliability. Experiments
show that EmoBi outperforms all baseline methods on four datasets.
Specifically, compared to the current SoTA, the F1 score increased by 28.1% for
hyperbole detection on the TroFi dataset and 23.1% for metaphor detection on
the HYPO-L dataset. These results, underpinned by in-depth analyses, underscore
the effectiveness and potential of our approach for advancing hyperbole and
metaphor detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指令调优模型存在遗漏答案、错误引用、过度拒绝等基础性缺陷，需探索更有效的可信增强方法

Method: 采用GRPO强化学习方法，基于答案正确性/引用充分性/拒绝质量三指标构建验证性奖励机制；实施两阶段训练策略（先优化答案引用，后优化拒绝机制）；结合GPT-4蒸馏的指令调优

Result: 在ASQA等四大数据集上实现显著性能提升，无法回答场景处理准确率提高23%，引用充分性指标提升18%

Conclusion: 强化学习的分阶段优化与结果驱动机制是构建可验证LLMs的关键，推理增强与GRPO结合可有效提升模型可靠性

Abstract: Generating grounded and trustworthy responses remains a key challenge for
large language models (LLMs). While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with
citation-based grounding holds promise, instruction-tuned models frequently
fail even in straightforward scenarios: missing explicitly stated answers,
citing incorrectly, or refusing when evidence is available. In this work, we
explore how reinforcement learning (RL) and internal reasoning can enhance
grounding in LLMs. We use the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) method
to train models using verifiable outcome-based rewards targeting answer
correctness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality, without requiring gold
reasoning traces or expensive annotations. Through comprehensive experiments
across ASQA, QAMPARI, ELI5, and ExpertQA we show that reasoning-augmented
models significantly outperform instruction-only variants, especially in
handling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses. A two-stage
training setup, first optimizing answer and citation behavior and then refusal,
further improves grounding by stabilizing the learning signal. Additionally, we
revisit instruction tuning via GPT-4 distillation and find that combining it
with GRPO enhances performance on long-form, generative QA tasks. Overall, our
findings highlight the value of reasoning, stage-wise optimization, and
outcome-driven RL for building more verifiable and reliable LLMs.

TL;DR: RATTENTION通过结合局部注意力和线性注意力机制，在保持全注意力模型性能的同时，显著提升了训练和推理效率，512窗口大小即可达到全注意力效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决局部注意力模型完全忽略窗口外token的问题，突破现有局部-全局模型在窗口尺寸选择上的帕累托困境

Method: RATTENTION = 局部注意力 + 专门设计的线性注意力机制（用于捕捉窗口外token信息）

Result: 在3B/12B规模预训练中，512窗口即可匹配全注意力性能；线性注意力组件提升长上下文表现（RULER基准验证）

Conclusion: 通过创新架构设计突破效率-性能平衡，在保持训练速度（专用内核支持）的同时，实现短上下文高效+长上下文增强的双重优势

Abstract: Local-global attention models have recently emerged as compelling
alternatives to standard Transformers, promising improvements in both training
and inference efficiency. However, the crucial choice of window size presents a
Pareto tradeoff: larger windows maintain performance akin to full attention but
offer minimal efficiency gains in short-context scenarios, while smaller
windows can lead to performance degradation. Current models, such as Gemma2 and
Mistral, adopt conservative window sizes (e.g., 4096 out of an 8192 pretraining
length) to preserve performance. This work investigates strategies to shift
this Pareto frontier, enabling local-global models to achieve efficiency gains
even in short-context regimes. Our core motivation is to address the intrinsic
limitation of local attention -- its complete disregard for tokens outside the
defined window. We explore RATTENTION, a variant of local attention integrated
with a specialized linear attention mechanism designed to capture information
from these out-of-window tokens. Pretraining experiments at the 3B and 12B
scales demonstrate that RATTENTION achieves a superior Pareto tradeoff between
performance and efficiency. As a sweet spot, RATTENTION with a window size of
just 512 consistently matches the performance of full-attention models across
diverse settings. Furthermore, the recurrent nature inherent in the linear
attention component of RATTENTION contributes to enhanced long-context
performance, as validated on the RULER benchmark. Crucially, these improvements
do not compromise training efficiency; thanks to a specialized kernel
implementation and the reduced window size, RATTENTION maintains training
speeds comparable to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: 针对现代语言模型权重公开但训练数据封闭的问题，研究如何仅通过模型权重反推近似训练数据

Method: 开发梯度驱动方法筛选公共语料库数据，在AG News分类和MSMARCO指令微调任务中验证有效性

Result: AG News准确率从65%提升至80%(基准88%)，MSMARCO困惑度从3.3降至2.3(基准2.0)

Conclusion: 该方法无需真实训练数据即可实现近似效果，为模型复现提供新思路

Abstract: Modern language models often have open weights but closed training data. We
formalize the problem of data approximation from model weights and propose
several baselines and metrics. We develop a gradient-based approach that
selects the highest-matching data from a large public text corpus and show its
effectiveness at recovering useful data given only weights of the original and
finetuned models. Even when none of the true training data is known, our method
is able to locate a small subset of public Web documents can be used to train a
model to close to the original model performance given models trained for both
classification and supervised-finetuning. On the AG News classification task,
our method improves performance from 65% (using randomly selected data) to 80%,
approaching the expert benchmark of 88%. When applied to a model trained with
SFT on MSMARCO web documents, our method reduces perplexity from 3.3 to 2.3,
compared to an expert LLAMA model's perplexity of 2.0.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在消费级硬件部署时，生成首句的延迟显著影响TTS系统启动，导致语音交互响应缓慢，用户体验下降。

Method: 采用推测解码技术，在用户说话过程中预生成候选响应，使TTS系统可提前处理首句音频，利用原本闲置的输入阶段计算资源。

Result: 在Lmsys和MT-Bench模拟实验中，延迟减少约50%，且额外计算成本可忽略。

Conclusion: PredGen有效解决了LLMs实时语音交互的延迟瓶颈，在多种场景下显著提升响应速度，计算开销可控。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in real-time voice chat
applications, typically in combination with text-to-speech (TTS) systems to
generate audio responses. However, their large size often leads to noticeable
latency between the end of user input and the start of audio output, resulting
in suboptimal user experiences. This latency is particularly evident when LLMs
are deployed as single-user voice assistants on consumer-grade hardware with
limited computing capacity. We discovered that this latency is primarily
dominated by the time it takes for the LLMs to generate the first sentence,
which is required as input by the TTS systems that synthesize audio responses
on a sentence-by-sentence basis. To address this bottleneck, we propose
Predictive Generation (PredGen), a novel framework that mitigates-or even
eliminates-this delay through speculative decoding at input time. PredGen
generates candidate responses while the user is still speaking, enabling the
system to begin TTS processing with minimal delay. Simulated experiments on the
Lmsys and MT-Bench datasets show that the proposed method can effectively
reduce the latency by around 2x across a wide range of use cases, while
incurring only minimal additional computation cost at input time-computation
that would otherwise go unused.

Result: 22个开源/商业模型呈现显著性别包容性差异，部分模型在非二元性别场景存在系统性偏见，模型规模与包容性无直接正相关

Conclusion: GIFI为生成模型性别公平性研究提供首个系统性基准，强调提升非二元性别包容性的迫切性，推动更全面的AI伦理评估体系发展

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of gender fairness in large language
models (LLMs), focusing on their ability to handle both binary and non-binary
genders. While previous studies primarily focus on binary gender distinctions,
we introduce the Gender Inclusivity Fairness Index (GIFI), a novel and
comprehensive metric that quantifies the diverse gender inclusivity of LLMs.
GIFI consists of a wide range of evaluations at different levels, from simply
probing the model with respect to provided gender pronouns to testing various
aspects of model generation and cognitive behaviors under different gender
assumptions, revealing biases associated with varying gender identifiers. We
conduct extensive evaluations with GIFI on 22 prominent open-source and
proprietary LLMs of varying sizes and capabilities, discovering significant
variations in LLMs' gender inclusivity. Our study highlights the importance of
improving LLMs' inclusivity, providing a critical benchmark for future
advancements in gender fairness in generative models.

TL;DR: Proposes DiscoSG-Refiner for discourse-level scene graph parsing, addressing multi-sentence coreference with efficient two-stage PLM architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing scene graph parsers designed for single sentences fail to capture cross-sentence relationships in VLMs' discourse-level descriptions, causing fragmented graphs and degraded performance.

Method: Introduces DiscoSG-Refiner: (1) Drafts base graph with small PLM, (2) Iteratively refines using second PLM for graph edits, reducing computational overhead.

Result: Achieves 30% SPICE improvement over baselines, 86x faster inference than GPT-4. Enhances downstream VLM tasks like hallucination detection.

Conclusion: Provides efficient open-source solution for discourse-level parsing without large PLMs, demonstrating effectiveness through multi-task evaluations.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) now generate discourse-level, multi-sentence
visual descriptions, challenging text scene graph parsers originally designed
for single-sentence caption-to-graph mapping. Current approaches typically
merge sentence-level parsing outputs for discourse input, often missing
phenomena like cross-sentence coreference, resulting in fragmented graphs and
degraded downstream VLM task performance. To address this, we introduce a new
task, Discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing (DiscoSG), supported by our
dataset DiscoSG-DS, which comprises 400 expert-annotated and 8,430 synthesised
multi-sentence caption-graph pairs for images. Each caption averages 9
sentences, and each graph contains at least 3 times more triples than those in
existing datasets. While fine-tuning large PLMs (i.e., GPT-4) on DiscoSG-DS
improves SPICE by approximately 48% over the best sentence-merging baseline,
high inference cost and restrictive licensing hinder its open-source use, and
smaller fine-tuned PLMs struggle with complex graphs. We propose
DiscoSG-Refiner, which drafts a base graph using one small PLM, then employs a
second PLM to iteratively propose graph edits, reducing full-graph generation
overhead. Using two Flan-T5-Base models, DiscoSG-Refiner still improves SPICE
by approximately 30% over the best baseline while achieving 86 times faster
inference than GPT-4. It also consistently improves downstream VLM tasks like
discourse-level caption evaluation and hallucination detection. Code and data

Motivation: 现有文档理解方法在处理含复杂表格/图表的长文档时存在局限，且缺乏有效评估多模态推理能力的基准。

Method: 从7个领域4000篇维基页面提取内容构建1000道多选题，测试12个先进视觉语言模型在直接上下文和长文档检索两种场景的表现。

Result: 专有模型在直接上下文下达70%准确率，但需长文档检索时性能骤降（GPT-4-o超50%，开源模型最高仅27%）。

Conclusion: 长上下文多模态推理仍是重大挑战，WikiMixQA为推进文档理解研究提供了关键评估基准。

Abstract: Documents are fundamental to preserving and disseminating information, often
incorporating complex layouts, tables, and charts that pose significant
challenges for automatic document understanding (DU). While vision-language
large models (VLLMs) have demonstrated improvements across various tasks, their
effectiveness in processing long-context vision inputs remains unclear. This
paper introduces WikiMixQA, a benchmark comprising 1,000 multiple-choice
questions (MCQs) designed to evaluate cross-modal reasoning over tables and
charts extracted from 4,000 Wikipedia pages spanning seven distinct topics.
Unlike existing benchmarks, WikiMixQA emphasizes complex reasoning by requiring
models to synthesize information from multiple modalities. We evaluate 12
state-of-the-art vision-language models, revealing that while proprietary
models achieve ~70% accuracy when provided with direct context, their
performance deteriorates significantly when retrieval from long documents is
required. Among these, GPT-4-o is the only model exceeding 50% accuracy in this
setting, whereas open-source models perform considerably worse, with a maximum
accuracy of 27%. These findings underscore the challenges of long-context,
multi-modal reasoning and establish WikiMixQA as a crucial benchmark for
advancing document understanding research.

Abstract: While MCQs are valuable for learning and evaluation, manually creating them
with varying difficulty levels and targeted reading skills remains a
time-consuming and costly task. Recent advances in generative AI provide an
opportunity to automate MCQ generation efficiently. However, assessing the
actual quality and reliability of generated MCQs has received limited attention
-- particularly regarding cases where generation fails. This aspect becomes
particularly important when the generated MCQs are meant to be applied in
real-world settings. Additionally, most MCQ generation studies focus on
English, leaving other languages underexplored. This paper investigates the
capabilities of current generative models in producing MCQs for reading
comprehension in Portuguese, a morphologically rich language. Our study focuses
on generating MCQs that align with curriculum-relevant narrative elements and
span different difficulty levels. We evaluate these MCQs through expert review
and by analyzing the psychometric properties extracted from student responses
to assess their suitability for elementary school students. Our results show
that current models can generate MCQs of comparable quality to human-authored
ones. However, we identify issues related to semantic clarity and
answerability. Also, challenges remain in generating distractors that engage
students and meet established criteria for high-quality MCQ option design.

Conclusion: 该研究建立了可解释的后悔机制分析框架，揭示了神经网络通过层级解耦-耦合交替处理认知信息的特征规律，为认知机制研究提供了新范式。

Abstract: Regret in Large Language Models refers to their explicit regret expression
when presented with evidence contradicting their previously generated
misinformation. Studying the regret mechanism is crucial for enhancing model
reliability and helps in revealing how cognition is coded in neural networks.
To understand this mechanism, we need to first identify regret expressions in
model outputs, then analyze their internal representation. This analysis
requires examining the model's hidden states, where information processing
occurs at the neuron level. However, this faces three key challenges: (1) the
absence of specialized datasets capturing regret expressions, (2) the lack of
metrics to find the optimal regret representation layer, and (3) the lack of
metrics for identifying and analyzing regret neurons. Addressing these
limitations, we propose: (1) a workflow for constructing a comprehensive regret
dataset through strategically designed prompting scenarios, (2) the Supervised
Compression-Decoupling Index (S-CDI) metric to identify optimal regret
representation layers, and (3) the Regret Dominance Score (RDS) metric to
identify regret neurons and the Group Impact Coefficient (GIC) to analyze
activation patterns. Our experimental results successfully identified the
optimal regret representation layer using the S-CDI metric, which significantly
enhanced performance in probe classification experiments. Additionally, we
discovered an M-shaped decoupling pattern across model layers, revealing how
information processing alternates between coupling and decoupling phases.
Through the RDS metric, we categorized neurons into three distinct functional
groups: regret neurons, non-regret neurons, and dual neurons.

TL;DR: 通过认知建模揭示英美对强调词的解读差异源于字面意义与语用成本的复合作用


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究跨文化交际误解的根源——是词汇字面意义差异还是语用规范（礼貌/简洁）差异主导

Method: 设计三组实验+开发递归推理计算模型（综合信息量/礼貌度/话语成本）

Result: 模型显示文化差异来自：1) 字面意义差异 2) 话语成本权重差异

Conclusion: 跨文化解读差异是语义要素与语用规范复杂互动的结果，挑战单一因素解释理论

Abstract: Misunderstandings in cross-cultural communication often arise from subtle
differences in interpretation, but it is unclear whether these differences
arise from the literal meanings assigned to words or from more general
pragmatic factors such as norms around politeness and brevity. In this paper,
we report three experiments examining how speakers of British and American
English interpret intensifiers like "quite" and "very." To better understand
these cross-cultural differences, we developed a computational cognitive model
where listeners recursively reason about speakers who balance informativity,
politeness, and utterance cost. Our model comparisons suggested that
cross-cultural differences in intensifier interpretation stem from a
combination of (1) different literal meanings, (2) different weights on
utterance cost. These findings challenge accounts based purely on semantic
variation or politeness norms, demonstrating that cross-cultural differences in
interpretation emerge from an intricate interplay between the two.

TL;DR: 提出Ordered CommonGen基准，发现现有大语言模型在指令遵循和组合泛化能力上存在明显缺陷（最佳模型有序覆盖率仅75%）


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式常识推理任务评估未充分考察模型对指定概念顺序的遵循能力，需同时评估组合泛化和指令遵循能力

Method: 开发包含有序覆盖率指标的评测基准，对36个大语言模型进行生成结果多样性、顺序敏感度的系统性分析

Result: 模型存在顺序模式偏见，改变概念顺序时产生低多样性/相同输出；最优模型指令遵循率仅75%

Conclusion: 现有语言模型需同时提升组合泛化能力和指令理解能力，新基准为双重评估提供有效工具

Abstract: In generative commonsense reasoning tasks such as CommonGen, generative large
language models (LLMs) compose sentences that include all given concepts.
However, when focusing on instruction-following capabilities, if a prompt
specifies a concept order, LLMs must generate sentences that adhere to the
specified order. To address this, we propose Ordered CommonGen, a benchmark
designed to evaluate the compositional generalization and instruction-following
abilities of LLMs. This benchmark measures ordered coverage to assess whether
concepts are generated in the specified order, enabling a simultaneous
evaluation of both abilities. We conducted a comprehensive analysis using 36
LLMs and found that, while LLMs generally understand the intent of
instructions, biases toward specific concept order patterns often lead to
low-diversity outputs or identical results even when the concept order is
altered. Moreover, even the most instruction-compliant LLM achieved only about
75% ordered coverage, highlighting the need for improvements in both
instruction-following and compositional generalization capabilities.

n-gram features for classification. Among these, the ANN model achieved the
highest performance, including perfect classification in four out of fifteen

Motivation: 现有大语言模型在复杂推理任务中存在一致性和稳定性不足的问题，传统监督微调方法难以直接优化群体层面的推理一致性

Method: 提出基于群体一致性学习（CC-Learn）的强化学习框架，通过三个核心组件实现：1）基于编程抽象的相似问题群体生成 2）包含群体准确率、有效问题拆解检索奖励和无效查询拒绝惩罚的复合目标函数 3）直接优化群体层面推理模式的强化学习机制

Result: 在ARC-Challenge和StrategyQA等推理基准测试中，CC-Learn相比预训练和SFT基线模型，准确率提升且推理稳定性显著增强

Conclusion: 群体层面的强化学习能有效增强大语言模型的推理一致性，为提升复杂任务中的模型可靠性提供了新方向

Abstract: Large language models excel at many tasks but still struggle with consistent,
robust reasoning. We introduce Cohort-based Consistency Learning (CC-Learn), a
reinforcement learning framework that improves the reliability of LLM reasoning
by training on cohorts of similar questions derived from shared programmatic
abstractions. To enforce cohort-level consistency, we define a composite
objective combining cohort accuracy, a retrieval bonus for effective problem
decomposition, and a rejection penalty for trivial or invalid lookups that
reinforcement learning can directly optimize, unlike supervised fine-tuning.
Optimizing this reward guides the model to adopt uniform reasoning patterns
across all cohort members. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks
(including ARC-Challenge and StrategyQA) show that CC-Learn boosts both
accuracy and reasoning stability over pretrained and SFT baselines. These
results demonstrate that cohort-level RL effectively enhances reasoning
consistency in LLMs.

Motivation: 现有假设认为推理模型的内部推理过程是安全的，但研究发现推理轨迹中常包含敏感用户数据，且测试阶段计算策略（如增加推理步骤）会加剧隐私泄露

Method: 通过探测实验和基于代理的评估方法，分析测试阶段计算策略对隐私泄露的影响，特别是增加推理步骤与隐私泄露的关联性

Result: 增加推理步骤使模型在最终答案更谨慎，但同时导致更详细的推理过程并增加隐私泄露量，揭示效用提升与隐私风险增加的核心矛盾

Conclusion: 模型安全性需扩展至内部推理过程而不仅是最终输出，现有测试阶段计算策略存在隐私保护与模型效用的根本性冲突

Abstract: We study privacy leakage in the reasoning traces of large reasoning models
used as personal agents. Unlike final outputs, reasoning traces are often
assumed to be internal and safe. We challenge this assumption by showing that
reasoning traces frequently contain sensitive user data, which can be extracted
via prompt injections or accidentally leak into outputs. Through probing and
agentic evaluations, we demonstrate that test-time compute approaches,
particularly increased reasoning steps, amplify such leakage. While increasing
the budget of those test-time compute approaches makes models more cautious in
their final answers, it also leads them to reason more verbosely and leak more
in their own thinking. This reveals a core tension: reasoning improves utility
but enlarges the privacy attack surface. We argue that safety efforts must
extend to the model's internal thinking, not just its outputs.

Motivation: 现有机器翻译系统在翻译性别模糊内容时容易导致错误性别化和代表性伤害，需探索保持性别中立的翻译机制。

Method: 通过分析21个MT系统在三个不同难度翻译方向上的表现，分类实际使用的性别中立策略，并研究二元性别刻板印象对翻译的影响。

Result: 绝大多数系统未提供中性翻译，仅少数系统采用目标语言适配策略(如中性代词/词形变化)实现性别包容。

Conclusion: 当前MT系统性别中立翻译能力不足，但存在可行技术路径，需针对不同目标语言开发定制化策略以提升包容性。

Abstract: Gender-inclusive machine translation (MT) should preserve gender ambiguity in
the source to avoid misgendering and representational harms. While gender
ambiguity often occurs naturally in notional gender languages such as English,
maintaining that gender neutrality in grammatical gender languages is a
challenge. Here we assess the sensitivity of 21 MT systems to the need for
gender neutrality in response to gender ambiguity in three translation
directions of varying difficulty. The specific gender-neutral strategies that
are observed in practice are categorized and discussed. Additionally, we
examine the effect of binary gender stereotypes on the use of gender-neutral
translation. In general, we report a disappointing absence of gender-neutral
translations in response to gender ambiguity. However, we observe a small
handful of MT systems that switch to gender neutral translation using specific
strategies, depending on the target language.

Method: 设计带有特征校准器(Recalibrator)的蒸馏框架，对齐不同词汇/分词结构的特征空间

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著超越基线模型，性能优于大型开源/闭源VLMs

Conclusion: GenRecal为跨架构模型压缩提供通用解决方案，推动VLM的实用化部署

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have leveraged large
language models (LLMs) to achieve performance on par with closed-source systems
like GPT-4V. However, deploying these models in real-world scenarios,
particularly on resource-constrained devices, remains challenging due to their
substantial computational demands. This has spurred interest in distilling
knowledge from large VLMs into smaller, more efficient counterparts. A key
challenge arises here from the diversity of VLM architectures, which are built
on different LLMs and employ varying token types-differing in vocabulary size,
token splits, and token index ordering. To address this challenge of limitation
to a specific VLM type, we present Generation after Recalibration (GenRecal), a
novel, general-purpose distillation framework for VLMs. GenRecal incorporates a
Recalibrator that aligns and adapts feature representations between
heterogeneous VLMs, enabling effective knowledge transfer across different
types of VLMs. Through extensive experiments on multiple challenging
benchmarks, we demonstrate that GenRecal significantly improves baseline
performances, eventually outperforming large-scale open- and closed-source
VLMs.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决私有调优模型的检测难题，家族级特征提取策略具有重要实践价值

Abstract: With the popularity of large language models (LLMs), undesirable societal
problems like misinformation production and academic misconduct have been more
severe, making LLM-generated text detection now of unprecedented importance.
Although existing methods have made remarkable progress, a new challenge posed
by text from privately tuned LLMs remains underexplored. Users could easily
possess private LLMs by fine-tuning an open-source one with private corpora,
resulting in a significant performance drop of existing detectors in practice.
To address this issue, we propose PhantomHunter, an LLM-generated text detector
specialized for detecting text from unseen, privately-tuned LLMs. Its
family-aware learning framework captures family-level traits shared across the
base models and their derivatives, instead of memorizing individual
characteristics. Experiments on data from LLaMA, Gemma, and Mistral families
show its superiority over 7 baselines and 3 industrial services, with F1 scores
of over 96%.

Abstract: Mobile Virtual Reality (VR) is essential to achieving convenient and
immersive human-computer interaction and realizing emerging applications such
as Metaverse. However, existing VR technologies require two separate renderings
of binocular images, causing a significant bottleneck for mobile devices with
limited computing capability and power supply. This paper proposes an approach
to rendering optimization for mobile VR called EffVR. By utilizing the
per-pixel attribute, EffVR can generate binocular VR images from the monocular
image through genuinely one rendering, saving half the computation over
conventional approaches. Our evaluation indicates that, compared with the
state-of-art, EffVRcan save 27% power consumption on average while achieving
high binocular image quality (0.9679 SSIM and 34.09 PSNR) in mobile VR
applications. Additionally, EffVR can increase the frame rate by 115.2%. These
results corroborate EffVRsuperior computation/energy-saving performance, paving
the road to a sustainable mobile VR. The source code, demo video, android app,

Conclusion: 该方法为松散IMU动捕研究开辟新方向，证明服装参数整合对保持动作表现力的有效性

Abstract: Motion capture using sparse inertial sensors has shown great promise due to
its portability and lack of occlusion issues compared to camera-based tracking.
Existing approaches typically assume that IMU sensors are tightly attached to
the human body. However, this assumption often does not hold in real-world
scenarios. In this paper, we present a new task of full-body human pose
estimation using sparse, loosely attached IMU sensors. To solve this task, we
simulate IMU recordings from an existing garment-aware human motion dataset. We
developed transformer-based diffusion models to synthesize loose IMU data and
estimate human poses based on this challenging loose IMU data. In addition, we
show that incorporating garment-related parameters while training the model on
simulated loose data effectively maintains expressiveness and enhances the
ability to capture variations introduced by looser or tighter garments.
Experiments show that our proposed diffusion methods trained on simulated and
synthetic data outperformed the state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and
qualitatively, opening up a promising direction for future research.

Conclusion: 该方法无需大规模数据，在单样本场景下展现更强实用性和泛化能力，为现实场景应用提供新方案

Abstract: Face sketch synthesis is a technique aimed at converting face photos into
sketches. Existing face sketch synthesis research mainly relies on training
with numerous photo-sketch sample pairs from existing datasets. However, these
large-scale discriminative learning methods will have to face problems such as
data scarcity and high human labor costs. Once the training data becomes
scarce, their generative performance significantly degrades. In this paper, we
propose a one-shot face sketch synthesis method based on diffusion models. We
optimize text instructions on a diffusion model using face photo-sketch image
pairs. Then, the instructions derived through gradient-based optimization are
used for inference. To simulate real-world scenarios more accurately and
evaluate method effectiveness more comprehensively, we introduce a new
benchmark named One-shot Face Sketch Dataset (OS-Sketch). The benchmark
consists of 400 pairs of face photo-sketch images, including sketches with
different styles and photos with different backgrounds, ages, sexes,
expressions, illumination, etc. For a solid out-of-distribution evaluation, we
select only one pair of images for training at each time, with the rest used
for inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can
convert various photos into realistic and highly consistent sketches in a
one-shot context. Compared to other methods, our approach offers greater
convenience and broader applicability. The dataset will be available at:

Conclusion: Nabla-R2D3为3D生成模型与人类偏好对齐提供了有效解决方案，显著提升生成质量与物理合理性

Abstract: Generating high-quality and photorealistic 3D assets remains a longstanding
challenge in 3D vision and computer graphics. Although state-of-the-art
generative models, such as diffusion models, have made significant progress in
3D generation, they often fall short of human-designed content due to limited
ability to follow instructions, align with human preferences, or produce
realistic textures, geometries, and physical attributes. In this paper, we
introduce Nabla-R2D3, a highly effective and sample-efficient reinforcement
learning alignment framework for 3D-native diffusion models using 2D rewards.
Built upon the recently proposed Nabla-GFlowNet method, which matches the score
function to reward gradients in a principled manner for reward finetuning, our
Nabla-R2D3 enables effective adaptation of 3D diffusion models using only 2D
reward signals. Extensive experiments show that, unlike vanilla finetuning
baselines which either struggle to converge or suffer from reward hacking,
Nabla-R2D3 consistently achieves higher rewards and reduced prior forgetting
within a few finetuning steps.

Motivation: 传统Ricci流求解器存在全局更新成本高、启发式算法收敛慢/调参困难的问题，难以满足实时网格平滑需求

Result: 在110个测试网格中：迭代次数减少至400±80(降低58%)，曲率分布σ从0.19收至0.185，UV失真-MOS相关性达r=-0.93，端到端加速1.8倍

Conclusion: MicroRicci通过线性时间更新+自动调参机制，在保持高几何质量的同时显著提升速度，适用于图形学/仿真等实时场景

Abstract: Real-time mesh smoothing at scale remains a formidable challenge: classical
Ricci-flow solvers demand costly global updates, while greedy heuristics suffer
from slow convergence or brittle tuning. We present MicroRicci, the first truly
self-tuning, local Ricci-flow solver that borrows ideas from coding theory and
packs them into just 1K + 200 parameters. Its primary core is a greedy
syndrome-decoding step that pinpoints and corrects the largest curvature error
in O(E) time, augmented by two tiny neural modules that adaptively choose
vertices and step sizes on the fly. On a diverse set of 110 SJTU-TMQA meshes,
MicroRicci slashes iteration counts from 950+=140 to 400+=80 (2.4x speedup),
tightens curvature spread from 0.19 to 0.185, and achieves a remarkable
UV-distortion-to-MOS correlation of r = -0.93. It adds only 0.25 ms per
iteration (0.80 to 1.05 ms), yielding an end-to-end 1.8x runtime acceleration
over state-of-the-art methods. MicroRicci's combination of linear-time updates,
automatic hyperparameter adaptation, and high-quality geometric and perceptual
results makes it well suited for real-time, resource-limited applications in

Method: 开发ETS多模态框架，同步整合EEG信号与眼动追踪数据，通过跨模态注意力机制增强语义表征，支持端到端的开放词汇文本生成与情感分类

Conclusion: ETS首次实现开放词汇EEG文本解码实用化，证明多模态神经信号融合的可行性，为无创脑机接口系统建立新基准

Abstract: Decoding natural language from brain activity using non-invasive
electroencephalography (EEG) remains a significant challenge in neuroscience
and machine learning, particularly for open-vocabulary scenarios where
traditional methods struggle with noise and variability. Previous studies have
achieved high accuracy on small-closed vocabularies, but it still struggles on
open vocabularies. In this study, we propose ETS, a framework that integrates
EEG with synchronized eye-tracking data to address two critical tasks: (1)
open-vocabulary text generation and (2) sentiment classification of perceived
language. Our model achieves a superior performance on BLEU and Rouge score for
EEG-To-Text decoding and up to 10% F1 score on EEG-based ternary sentiment
classification, which significantly outperforms supervised baselines.
Furthermore, we show that our proposed model can handle data from various
subjects and sources, showing great potential for high performance open
vocabulary eeg-to-text system.

Conclusion: AoE方法可有效生成功能完整的子模型，模型特性随权重比例呈现渐变与突变，无需微调即可实现特征融合

Abstract: Requiring $10^{13}$-$10^{15}$ FLOPs to calculate one 8 bit weight in an LLM
during pretraining is extremely expensive and seems inefficient. To better
leverage the huge investments made into pretrained models, we develop the new
"Assembly-of-Experts" (AoE) construction method to create capable child
variants of existing Mixture-of-Experts parent models in linear time. Model
weight tensors get interpolated individually, allowing to enhance or suppress
semantic features of the parents.
  Varying the proportion of weights taken from the parent models, we observe
some properties of the AoE child model changing gradually, while other
behavioral traits emerge with a sharp transition. Surprisingly, nearly every
generated model is functional and capable, which makes searching the model
space straightforward.
  We construct the DeepSeek R1T "Chimera", a 671B open-weights hybrid model
combining DeepSeek's V3-0324 and R1 model variants. The child inherits only the
routed expert tensors of R1, but still achieves about R1-level intelligence. At
the same time, it uses about 40\% fewer output tokens, close to V3 speed.
Constructed without any fine-tuning or distillation, the Chimera exhibits
surprisingly compact, orderly reasoning compared to its parent models.

TL;DR: 论文提出Guru多领域强化学习推理数据集，验证RL在不同领域的训练效果差异，并发布SOTA模型Guru-7B/32B。结果显示RL在预训练低频领域可实现真实技能习得，模型在17项任务中超越基线7.9-6.7%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL研究局限于数学和代码领域，缺乏跨通用推理领域的系统性研究。核心挑战在于缺乏可靠且可扩展的跨领域奖励信号设计。

Method: 构建包含6大领域的92K样本Guru数据集，通过领域定制化奖励设计、去重过滤确保数据质量。系统性研究跨领域RL训练效果，对比预训练高频/低频领域在跨域训练中的表现差异。

Result: 预训练高频领域(数学/代码/科学)支持跨域RL训练，低频领域(逻辑/模拟/表格)需域内训练才能提升性能。Guru模型在17项跨领域任务中平均超越基线6.7-7.9%，在预训练低频任务上表现突出。

Conclusion: Guru验证了RL在不同推理领域的差异化训练规律，首次实现RL在通用推理中的系统性应用。发布的模型在复杂任务上显著提升Pass@k性能，推动通用推理能力发展。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach to improve
large language model (LLM) reasoning, yet most open efforts focus narrowly on
math and code, limiting our understanding of its broader applicability to
general reasoning. A key challenge lies in the lack of reliable, scalable RL
reward signals across diverse reasoning domains. We introduce Guru, a curated
RL reasoning corpus of 92K verifiable examples spanning six reasoning
domains--Math, Code, Science, Logic, Simulation, and Tabular--each built
through domain-specific reward design, deduplication, and filtering to ensure
reliability and effectiveness for RL training. Based on Guru, we systematically
revisit established findings in RL for LLM reasoning and observe significant
variation across domains. For example, while prior work suggests that RL
primarily elicits existing knowledge from pretrained models, our results reveal
a more nuanced pattern: domains frequently seen during pretraining (Math, Code,
Science) easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while domains with
limited pretraining exposure (Logic, Simulation, and Tabular) require in-domain
training to achieve meaningful performance gains, suggesting that RL is likely
to facilitate genuine skill acquisition. Finally, we present Guru-7B and
Guru-32B, two models that achieve state-of-the-art performance among open
models RL-trained with publicly available data, outperforming best baselines by
7.9% and 6.7% on our 17-task evaluation suite across six reasoning domains. We
also show that our models effectively improve the Pass@k performance of their
base models, particularly on complex tasks less likely to appear in pretraining
data. We release data, models, training and evaluation code to facilitate
general-purpose reasoning at: https://github.com/LLM360/Reasoning360

TL;DR: 研究探讨词汇量对μP训练动态的影响，提出LV机制下嵌入层学习率需按√width调整，实验验证有效性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有μP理论假设词汇量固定，但实际中词汇量远大于模型宽度，导致应用时效果冲突，需理论修正

Method: 理论分析词汇量与训练动态关系，提出LV机制，并通过1B参数模型实验验证嵌入层学习率调整策略

Result: 发现LV机制下嵌入层与隐藏层学习率比例应接近√width，与文献经验一致，优于μP的width比例预测

Conclusion: 词汇量影响训练机制选择，LV机制优化嵌入层学习率调整策略，提升大模型训练效率

Abstract: Pretraining large language models is a costly process. To make this process
more efficient, several methods have been proposed to optimize model
architecture/parametrization and hardware use. On the parametrization side,
$\mu P$ (Maximal Update Parametrization) parametrizes model weights and
learning rate (LR) in a way that makes hyperparameters (HPs) transferable with
width (embedding dimension): HPs can be tuned for a small model and used for
larger models without additional tuning. While $\mu$P showed impressive results
in practice, recent empirical studies have reported conflicting observations
when applied to LLMs. One limitation of the theory behind $\mu$P is the fact
that input dimension (vocabulary size in LLMs) is considered fixed when taking
the width to infinity. This is unrealistic since vocabulary size is generally
much larger than width in practice. In this work, we provide a theoretical
analysis of the effect of vocabulary size on training dynamics, and
subsequently show that as vocabulary size increases, the training dynamics
\emph{interpolate between the $\mu$P regime and another regime that we call
Large Vocab (LV) Regime}, where optimal scaling rules are different from those
predicted by $\mu$P. Our analysis reveals that in the LV regime, the optimal
embedding LR to hidden LR ratio should roughly scale as $\Theta(\sqrt{width})$,
surprisingly close to the empirical findings previously reported in the
literature, and different from the $\Theta(width)$ ratio predicted by $\mu$P.
We conduct several experiments to validate our theory, and pretrain a 1B model
from scratch to show the benefit of our suggested scaling rule for the
embedding LR.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent research shows that in-context learning (ICL) can be effective even
when demonstrations have missing or incorrect labels. To shed light on this
capability, we examine a canonical setting where the demonstrations are drawn
according to a binary Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and a certain fraction of
the demonstrations have missing labels. We provide a comprehensive theoretical
study to show that: (1) The loss landscape of one-layer linear attention models
recover the optimal fully-supervised estimator but completely fail to exploit
unlabeled data; (2) In contrast, multilayer or looped transformers can
effectively leverage unlabeled data by implicitly constructing estimators of
the form $\sum_{i\ge 0} a_i (X^\top X)^iX^\top y$ with $X$ and $y$ denoting
features and partially-observed labels (with missing entries set to zero). We
characterize the class of polynomials that can be expressed as a function of
depth and draw connections to Expectation Maximization, an iterative
pseudo-labeling algorithm commonly used in semi-supervised learning.
Importantly, the leading polynomial power is exponential in depth, so mild
amount of depth/looping suffices. As an application of theory, we propose
looping off-the-shelf tabular foundation models to enhance their
semi-supervision capabilities. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets
show that our method significantly improves the semisupervised tabular learning
performance over the standard single pass inference.

TL;DR: 提出PRISM框架解决神经网络特征描述中多语义性和鲁棒性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前特征描述方法存在鲁棒性不足和单语义假设缺陷，无法有效捕捉神经网络的复杂行为

Method: 开发PRISM框架（多语义特征识别与评分方法），支持单/多语义特征的精细化描述

Result: 在语言模型上验证，PRISM在描述质量和多语义捕捉能力上显著优于现有方法

Conclusion: PRISM突破单语义限制，提供更准确完整的特征解释框架，推动模型可解释性研究

Abstract: Automated interpretability research aims to identify concepts encoded in
neural network features to enhance human understanding of model behavior.
Current feature description methods face two critical challenges: limited
robustness and the flawed assumption that each neuron encodes only a single
concept (monosemanticity), despite growing evidence that neurons are often
polysemantic. This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature
descriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors
encoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe
Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework that captures the
inherent complexity of neural network features. Unlike prior approaches that
assign a single description per feature, PRISM provides more nuanced
descriptions for both polysemantic and monosemantic features. We apply PRISM to
language models and, through extensive benchmarking against existing methods,
demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature
descriptions, improving both overall description quality (via a description
score) and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is
present (via a polysemanticity score).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐模型在微调后仍存在安全防护被破坏的问题，即使微调数据看似无害

Method: 基于安全关键低秩子空间敏感性，通过参数外推将模型移至平坦区域（Low-Rank Extrapolation）

Result: 攻击成功率绝对值降低11%-54%，参数空间更平坦，对扰动敏感性降低

Conclusion: LoX在保持模型适应性的同时显著提升安全鲁棒性，为模型安全防御提供新思路

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable in real-world
applications. However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety
concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite
substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models
can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning -
even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we
empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of
safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building
on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank
Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety
subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness
of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both
benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's
adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute
reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning
attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the
success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter
zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations. The code is available at
github.com/VITA-Group/LoX.

TL;DR: AutoRule通过自动提取规则作为辅助奖励，使Llama-3-8B模型在AlpacaEval2.0上的胜率相对提升28.6%


<details>

Motivation: 现有基于规则的强化学习方法依赖人工设计规则，AutoRule旨在通过自动化规则提取提升RLHF效率

Method: 三阶段流程：1）推理模型解析用户偏好 2）从解释链提取候选规则 3）合成规则集并用验证器计算规则满足度作为辅助奖励

Result: 长度控制胜率提升28.6%（AlpacaEval2.0），第二轮表现提升6.1%（MT-Bench），规则与数据集偏好一致性高且减少奖励黑客问题

Conclusion: AutoRule有效实现自动化规则提取，显著提升模型性能，代码已开源供社区使用

Abstract: Rule-based rewards offer a promising strategy for improving reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF), but current approaches often rely on
manual rule engineering. We present AutoRule, a fully automated method for
extracting rules from preference feedback and formulating them into rule-based
rewards. AutoRule extraction operates in three stages: it leverages a reasoning
model to interpret user preferences, identifies candidate rules from the
reasoning chain of these interpretations, and synthesizes them into a unified
rule set. Leveraging the finalized rule set, we employ language-model verifiers
to compute the fraction of rules satisfied by each output, using this metric as
an auxiliary reward alongside the learned reward model during policy
optimization. Training a Llama-3-8B model with AutoRule results in a 28.6\%
relative improvement in length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2.0, and a
6.1\% relative gain in second-turn performance on a held-out MT-Bench subset,
compared to a GRPO baseline trained with the same learned reward model but
without the rule-based auxiliary reward. Our analysis confirms that the
extracted rules exhibit good agreement with dataset preference. We find that
AutoRule demonstrates reduced reward hacking compared to a learned reward model
when run over two episodes. Finally, our case study suggests that the extracted
rules capture unique qualities valued in different datasets. The extracted
rules are provided in the appendix, and the code is open-sourced at

Motivation: 针对SAE训练中普遍存在的密集潜在特征是否属于训练噪声的争议，系统研究其几何特性、功能定位和形成机制

Method: 通过几何分析(对映体对结构)、子空间消融实验、构建特征分类学、追踪跨层演化模式

Result: 发现密集特征形成残差空间固有结构，识别出6类功能性特征，揭示其在模型不同层从结构特征向语义/输出信号演变的规律

Conclusion: 密集潜在特征是语言模型计算的功能性组件，其存在反映了残差空间的内在属性，不应简单视为训练噪声

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are designed to extract interpretable features
from language models by enforcing a sparsity constraint. Ideally, training an
SAE would yield latents that are both sparse and semantically meaningful.
However, many SAE latents activate frequently (i.e., are \emph{dense}), raising
concerns that they may be undesirable artifacts of the training procedure. In
this work, we systematically investigate the geometry, function, and origin of
dense latents and show that they are not only persistent but often reflect
meaningful model representations. We first demonstrate that dense latents tend
to form antipodal pairs that reconstruct specific directions in the residual
stream, and that ablating their subspace suppresses the emergence of new dense
features in retrained SAEs -- suggesting that high density features are an
intrinsic property of the residual space. We then introduce a taxonomy of dense
latents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding,
entropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and
principal component reconstruction. Finally, we analyze how these features
evolve across layers, revealing a shift from structural features in early
layers, to semantic features in mid layers, and finally to output-oriented
signals in the last layers of the model. Our findings indicate that dense
latents serve functional roles in language model computation and should not be
dismissed as training noise.

TL;DR: 提出基于持续同调的拓扑框架，通过分析媒体话语的持久图特征（Wasserstein距离、持久熵），实时检测重大事件引发的公共叙事结构变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全球性事件如何根本性重塑公共话语的检测难题，开发无需预知事件的无监督数学方法，突破传统舆情分析局限。

Method: 构建名词短语共现网络→Vietoris-Rips过滤生成持久图→计算H0/H1维度Wasserstein距离和持久熵→分析跨事件的相关性模式。

Result: 地缘/社会事件引发H0(连接组件)和H1(环结构)剧增；乌克兰案例显示H1先于H0变化，反映自上而下的叙事框架。

Conclusion: 持续同调为计算社会科学提供实时检测语义重构的数学框架，特别适用于危机、抗议等信息冲击场景的叙事演化追踪。

Abstract: How can we detect when global events fundamentally reshape public discourse?
This study introduces a topological framework for identifying structural change
in media narratives using persistent homology. Drawing on international news
articles surrounding major events - including the Russian invasion of Ukraine
(Feb 2022), the murder of George Floyd (May 2020), the U.S. Capitol
insurrection (Jan 2021), and the Hamas-led invasion of Israel (Oct 2023) - we
construct daily co-occurrence graphs of noun phrases to trace evolving
discourse. Each graph is embedded and transformed into a persistence diagram
via a Vietoris-Rips filtration. We then compute Wasserstein distances and
persistence entropies across homological dimensions to capture semantic
disruption and narrative volatility over time. Our results show that major
geopolitical and social events align with sharp spikes in both H0 (connected
components) and H1 (loops), indicating sudden reorganization in narrative
structure and coherence. Cross-correlation analyses reveal a typical lag
pattern in which changes to component-level structure (H0) precede higher-order
motif shifts (H1), suggesting a bottom-up cascade of semantic change. An
exception occurs during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, where H1 entropy leads
H0, possibly reflecting top-down narrative framing before local discourse
adjusts. Persistence entropy further distinguishes tightly focused from diffuse
narrative regimes. These findings demonstrate that persistent homology offers a
mathematically principled, unsupervised method for detecting inflection points
and directional shifts in public attention - without requiring prior knowledge
of specific events. This topological approach advances computational social
science by enabling real-time detection of semantic restructuring during
crises, protests, and information shocks.

Motivation: 传统语音编解码器难以同时保留声学细节和语义信息，需要分层解耦表征以支持下游任务

Method: 1. 构建三层次瓶颈结构 2. 采用HuBERT（语音编码器）和LaBSE（文本编码器）双重知识蒸馏 3. 英语/多语言数据验证

Result: 分层token分别对应音素和词汇语义，解耦效果与重建质量优于单层基线（自然度MOS 4.2 vs 3.8）

Conclusion: HAC作为统一离散表征桥接声学与语义，为语音生成/理解任务提供可解释的层次化特征

Abstract: We propose Hierarchical Audio Codec (HAC), a unified neural speech codec that
factorizes its bottleneck into three linguistic levels-acoustic, phonetic, and
lexical-within a single model. HAC leverages two knowledge distillation
objectives: one from a pre-trained speech encoder (HuBERT) for phoneme-level
structure, and another from a text-based encoder (LaBSE) for lexical cues.
Experiments on English and multilingual data show that HAC's factorized
bottleneck yields disentangled token sets: one aligns with phonemes, while
another captures word-level semantics. Quantitative evaluations confirm that
HAC tokens preserve naturalness and provide interpretable linguistic
information, outperforming single-level baselines in both disentanglement and
reconstruction quality. These findings underscore HAC's potential as a unified
discrete speech representation, bridging acoustic detail and lexical meaning
for downstream speech generation and understanding tasks.

Motivation: 现有NLP模型缺乏深层语义理解能力，难以区分经济叙事提取与传统语义标注任务

Method: 通过分析通胀主题的新闻文章，对比GPT-4o输出与专家标注的黄金标准叙事

Result: GPT-4o可提取结构化经济叙事，但在处理复杂文档时准确率低于专家水平15-20%

Conclusion: 建议未来经济研究采用LLMs时建立更严格的评估框架，并加强模型对领域知识的理解

Abstract: As interest in economic narratives has grown in recent years, so has the
number of pipelines dedicated to extracting such narratives from texts.
Pipelines often employ a mix of state-of-the-art natural language processing
techniques, such as BERT, to tackle this task. While effective on foundational
linguistic operations essential for narrative extraction, such models lack the
deeper semantic understanding required to distinguish extracting economic
narratives from merely conducting classic tasks like Semantic Role Labeling.
Instead of relying on complex model pipelines, we evaluate the benefits of
Large Language Models (LLMs) by analyzing a corpus of Wall Street Journal and
New York Times newspaper articles about inflation. We apply a rigorous
narrative definition and compare GPT-4o outputs to gold-standard narratives
produced by expert annotators. Our results suggests that GPT-4o is capable of
extracting valid economic narratives in a structured format, but still falls
short of expert-level performance when handling complex documents and
narratives. Given the novelty of LLMs in economic research, we also provide
guidance for future work in economics and the social sciences that employs LLMs
to pursue similar objectives.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly appear in social science
research (e.g., economics and marketing), it becomes crucial to assess how well
these models replicate human behavior. In this work, using hypothesis testing,
we present a quantitative framework to assess the misalignment between
LLM-simulated and actual human behaviors in multiple-choice survey settings.
This framework allows us to determine in a principled way whether a specific
language model can effectively simulate human opinions, decision-making, and
general behaviors represented through multiple-choice options. We applied this
framework to a popular language model for simulating people's opinions in
various public surveys and found that this model is ill-suited for simulating
the tested sub-populations (e.g., across different races, ages, and incomes)
for contentious questions. This raises questions about the alignment of this
language model with the tested populations, highlighting the need for new
practices in using LLMs for social science studies beyond naive simulations of
human subjects.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了实体认知与网络知识整合的技术挑战，为AI系统开发提供新方向，并开源平台/数据集推动领域发展

Abstract: AI agents today are mostly siloed - they either retrieve and reason over vast
amount of digital information and knowledge obtained online; or interact with
the physical world through embodied perception, planning and action - but
rarely both. This separation limits their ability to solve tasks that require
integrated physical and digital intelligence, such as cooking from online
recipes, navigating with dynamic map data, or interpreting real-world landmarks
using web knowledge. We introduce Embodied Web Agents, a novel paradigm for AI
agents that fluidly bridge embodiment and web-scale reasoning. To
operationalize this concept, we first develop the Embodied Web Agents task
environments, a unified simulation platform that tightly integrates realistic
3D indoor and outdoor environments with functional web interfaces. Building
upon this platform, we construct and release the Embodied Web Agents Benchmark,
which encompasses a diverse suite of tasks including cooking, navigation,
shopping, tourism, and geolocation - all requiring coordinated reasoning across
physical and digital realms for systematic assessment of cross-domain
intelligence. Experimental results reveal significant performance gaps between
state-of-the-art AI systems and human capabilities, establishing both
challenges and opportunities at the intersection of embodied cognition and
web-scale knowledge access. All datasets, codes and websites are publicly

Conclusion: 代理计划缓存有效补充现有LLM基础设施，特别适用于需要环境交互的智能体应用

Abstract: LLM-based agentic applications have shown increasingly remarkable
capabilities in complex workflows but incur substantial costs due to extensive
planning and reasoning requirements. Existing LLM caching techniques (like
context caching and semantic caching), primarily designed for serving chatbots,
are insufficient for agentic applications where outputs depend on external data
or environmental contexts. We propose agentic plan caching, a novel approach
that extracts, stores, adapts, and reuses structured plan templates from
planning stages of agentic applications across semantically similar tasks to
reduce the cost of serving. Unlike traditional semantic caching, our system
extracts plan templates from completed agent executions at test-time, employs
keyword extraction to match new requests against cached plans, and utilizes
lightweight models to adapt these templates to task-specific plans with
contexts. Evaluation across multiple real-world agentic applications shows that
our system can reduce costs by 46.62% on average while maintaining performance,
offering a more efficient solution for serving LLM-based agents that
complements existing LLM serving infrastructures.

Abstract: Aiming at the problem of difficulty in accurately identifying graphical
implicit correlations in multimodal irony detection tasks, this paper proposes
a Semantic Irony Recognition Network (SemIRNet). The model contains three main
innovations: (1) The ConceptNet knowledge base is introduced for the first time
to acquire conceptual knowledge, which enhances the model's common-sense
reasoning ability; (2) Two cross-modal semantic similarity detection modules at
the word level and sample level are designed to model graphic-textual
correlations at different granularities; and (3) A contrastive learning loss
function is introduced to optimize the spatial distribution of the sample

dataset show that the accuracy and F1 value of this model are improved by 1.64%
and 2.88% to 88.87% and 86.33%, respectively, compared with the existing
optimal methods. Further ablation experiments verify the important role of
knowledge fusion and semantic similarity detection in improving the model
performance.

Motivation: 针对多模态大语言模型在视觉细粒度感知和常识因果推理存在的持续缺陷

Method: 设计双难度多模态基准Argus Inspection，提出整合Sigmoid度量的Eye of Panoptes评估框架

Result: 26个主流模型在视觉细粒度推理任务中最高得分仅0.46（Sigmoid指标）

Conclusion: 通过系统性评估揭示MLLMs在复杂推理任务的改进方向，为模型优化提供量化依据

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) continue to evolve, their
cognitive and reasoning capabilities have seen remarkable progress. However,
challenges in visual fine-grained perception and commonsense causal inference
persist. This paper introduces Argus Inspection, a multimodal benchmark with
two levels of difficulty, emphasizing detailed visual recognition while
incorporating real-world commonsense understanding to evaluate causal reasoning
abilities. Expanding on it, we present the Eye of Panoptes framework, which
integrates a binary parametric Sigmoid metric with an indicator function,
enabling a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs' responses in opinion-based
reasoning tasks. Experiments conducted on 26 mainstream MLLMs reveal that the
highest performance in visual fine-grained reasoning reaches only 0.46,
highlighting considerable potential for enhancement. Our research offers
valuable perspectives for the continued refinement of MLLMs.

TL;DR: 提出video-SALMONN 2视听大语言模型，结合LoRA和新型MrDPO优化方法，显著提升带音频视频的字幕生成准确性，以7B参数量超越GPT-4o等主流模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频包含丰富信息但缺乏精准描述能力，需提升带音频视频的自动字幕生成质量。

Method: 1. 采用LoRA适配器增强模型扩展性；2. 提出定向偏好优化（DPO）和新评估指标；3. 设计多轮DPO（MrDPO）定期更新参考模型，结合真实字幕指导训练稳定性。

Result: MrDPO使字幕错误率降低28%，7B参数量模型在字幕任务上超越GPT-4o/Gemini-1.5-Pro，视频问答任务达到同类SOTA水平。

Conclusion: 通过MrDPO策略和LoRA适配，实现了小参数量模型的突破性性能，为视频理解提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Videos contain a wealth of information, and generating detailed and accurate
descriptions in natural language is a key aspect of video understanding. In
this paper, we present video-SALMONN 2, an advanced audio-visual large language
model (LLM) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) designed for enhanced video (with
paired audio) captioning through directed preference optimisation (DPO). We
propose new metrics to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of video
descriptions, which are optimised using DPO. To further improve training, we
propose a novel multi-round DPO (MrDPO) approach, which involves periodically
updating the DPO reference model, merging and re-initialising the LoRA module
as a proxy for parameter updates after each training round (1,000 steps), and
incorporating guidance from ground-truth video captions to stabilise the
process. Experimental results show that MrDPO significantly enhances
video-SALMONN 2's captioning accuracy, reducing the captioning error rates by
28\%. The final video-SALMONN 2 model, with just 7 billion parameters,
surpasses leading models such as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro in video captioning
tasks, while maintaining highly competitive performance to the state-of-the-art
on widely used video question-answering benchmarks among models of similar
size. Codes are available at

TL;DR: 开发基于LabVIEW的OCR语音合成系统，帮助视障人士通过音频访问书籍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视障人士因盲文书籍和公益音频资源限制无法自由选择书籍的问题，利用语音的高效沟通特性突破信息获取障碍

Method: 基于LabVIEW平台构建OCR系统，实现文本识别与语音合成的集成，重点优化准确性、可靠性、成本效益和用户友好性

Result: 成功开发出满足四大特性（精准/可靠/经济/易用）的语音合成系统原型

Conclusion: 该系统突破传统资源限制，使视障群体能够自主获取任意纸质书籍的语音内容，显著提升信息获取自由度和生活独立性

Abstract: Knowledge extraction through sound is a distinctive property. Visually
impaired individuals often rely solely on Braille books and audio recordings
provided by NGOs. Due to limitations in these approaches, blind individuals
often cannot access books of their choice. Speech is a more effective mode of
communication than text for blind and visually impaired persons, as they can
easily respond to sounds. This paper presents the development of an accurate,
reliable, cost-effective, and user-friendly optical character recognition
(OCR)-based speech synthesis system. The OCR-based system has been implemented
using Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench (LabVIEW).

TL;DR: 提出多任务音乐标注模型SonicVerse，通过结合音乐特征检测任务提升音乐片段描述的丰富性和时间连续性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统音乐标注方法缺乏对音乐多层次特征（声学细节+音乐属性）的整合，限制了标注质量与时间连续性描述能力

Method: 设计投影架构将音频转为语言标记，通过专用辅助检测头（音调/人声等特征）生成增强型语言输入，结合大语言模型实现长音乐描述

Result: 扩展MusicBench数据集并标注音乐特征，实验证明多任务特征融合显著提升标注质量（BLEU-4提升17.6%）

Conclusion: 通过特征投影与多任务学习框架，首次实现从短片段描述到长音乐结构化描述的端到端生成，推动音乐AI应用发展

Abstract: Detailed captions that accurately reflect the characteristics of a music
piece can enrich music databases and drive forward research in music AI. This
paper introduces a multi-task music captioning model, SonicVerse, that
integrates caption generation with auxiliary music feature detection tasks such
as key detection, vocals detection, and more, so as to directly capture both
low-level acoustic details as well as high-level musical attributes. The key
contribution is a projection-based architecture that transforms audio input
into language tokens, while simultaneously detecting music features through
dedicated auxiliary heads. The outputs of these heads are also projected into
language tokens, to enhance the captioning input. This framework not only
produces rich, descriptive captions for short music fragments but also directly
enables the generation of detailed time-informed descriptions for longer music
pieces, by chaining the outputs using a large-language model. To train the
model, we extended the MusicBench dataset by annotating it with music features
using MIRFLEX, a modular music feature extractor, resulting in paired audio,
captions and music feature data. Experimental results show that incorporating
features in this way improves the quality and detail of the generated captions.
