To tackle this issue, we first proposed the Multi-Level\nSketch Representation Scheme to systematically identify the effective\ninformation.

In this work, we explore whether this brittleness is\na direct result of unstable internal knowledge representations. To explore this\nquestion, we build on previous work showing that LLM representations encode\nstatement truthfulness -- i.e., true, factual statements can be easily\nseparated from false, inaccurate ones. Specifically, we test the robustness of\nlearned knowledge by evaluating representation separability on samples that\nhave undergone superficial transformations to drive them out-of-distribution\n(OOD), such as typos or reformulations. By applying semantically-preserving\nperturbations, we study how separability degrades as statements become more\nOOD, across four LLM families, five evaluation datasets, and three knowledge\nprobing methods. Our results reveal that internal representations of statement\ntruthfulness collapse as the samples' presentations become less similar to\nthose seen during pre-training. While LLMs can often distinguish between true\nand false statements when they closely resemble the pre-training data, this\nability is highly dependent on the statement's exact surface form.

In\nthis paper, we argue for treating the token budget of an LLM as an attention\nbudget and elevating task-aware text reduction as a first-class design\nprinciple for language -- data systems. We position input-side reduction not as\ncompression, but as attention allocation: prioritizing information most\nrelevant to downstream tasks.

As an emerging form of RAG, parametric\nretrieval-augmented generation (PRAG) encodes documents as model parameters\n(i.e., LoRA modules) and injects these representations into the model during\ninference, enabling interaction between the LLM and documents at parametric\nlevel. Compared with directly placing documents in the input context, PRAG is\nmore efficient and has the potential to offer deeper model-document\ninteraction. Despite its growing attention, the mechanism underlying parametric\ninjection remains poorly understood. In this work, we present a systematic\nstudy of PRAG to clarify the role of parametric injection, showing that\nparameterized documents capture only partial semantic information of documents,\nand relying on them alone yields inferior performance compared to interaction\nat text level. However, these parametric representations encode high-level\ndocument information that can enhance the model's understanding of documents\nwithin the input context. When combined parameterized documents with textual\ndocuments, the model can leverage relevant information more effectively and\nbecome more robust to noisy inputs, achieving better performance than either\nsource alone. We recommend jointly using parameterized and textual documents\nand advocate for increasing the information content of parametric\nrepresentations to advance PRAG."}

Yet\nour experiments reveal that current hybrid thinking LLMs only achieve partial\nmode separation: reasoning behaviors often leak into the no-think mode. To\nunderstand and mitigate this, we analyze the factors influencing\ncontrollability and identify four that matter most: (1) larger data scale, (2)\nusing think and no-think answers from different questions rather than the same\nquestion, (3) a moderate increase in no-think data number, and (4) a two-phase\nstrategy that first trains reasoning ability and then applies hybrid think\ntraining. Building on these findings, we propose a practical recipe that,\ncompared to standard training, can maintain accuracy in both modes while\nsignificantly reducing no-think output length (from $1085$ to $585$ on MATH500)\nand occurrences of reasoning-supportive tokens such as ``\\texttt{wait}'' (from\n$5917$ to $522$ on MATH500). Our findings highlight the limitations of current\nhybrid thinking and offer directions for strengthening its controllability."}

Human vs. Algorithmic Judge Assignment in a High-Stakes Startup Competition", "categories": ["cs.HC", "cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.CY", "cs.LG"], "comment": "17 Pages, 2 figures", "summary": "There is growing interest in applying artificial intelligence (AI) to\nautomate and support complex decision-making tasks. However, it remains unclear\nhow algorithms compare to human judgment in contexts requiring semantic\nunderstanding and domain expertise. We examine this in the context of the judge\nassignment problem, matching submissions to suitably qualified judges.\nSpecifically, we tackled this problem at the Harvard President's Innovation\nChallenge, the university's premier venture competition awarding over \\$500,000\nto student and alumni startups. This represents a real-world environment where\nhigh-quality judge assignment is essential. We developed an AI-based\njudge-assignment algorithm, Hybrid Lexical-Semantic Similarity Ensemble (HLSE),\nand deployed it at the competition. We then evaluated its performance against\nhuman expert assignments using blinded match-quality scores from judges on\n$309$ judge-venture pairs. Using a Mann-Whitney U statistic based test, we\nfound no statistically significant difference in assignment quality between the\ntwo approaches ($AUC=0.48, p=0.40$); on average, algorithmic matches are rated\n$3.90$ and manual matches $3.94$ on a 5-point scale, where 5 indicates an\nexcellent match. Furthermore, manual assignments that previously required a\nfull week could be automated in several hours by the algorithm during\ndeployment. These results demonstrate that HLSE achieves human-expert-level\nmatching quality while offering greater scalability and efficiency,\nunderscoring the potential of AI-driven solutions to support and enhance human\ndecision-making for judge assignment in high-stakes settings."}

In practice, however, utterances seldom occur in\nisolation: long-form audio is commonplace in domains such as interviews, phone\ncalls, and meetings. In these cases, many utterances from the same speaker are\navailable, which pose a significantly greater privacy risk: given multiple\nutterances from the same speaker, an attacker could exploit an individual's\nvocabulary, syntax, and turns of phrase to re-identify them, even when their\nvoice is completely disguised. To address this risk, we propose new content\nanonymization approaches. Our approach performs a contextual rewriting of the\ntranscripts in an ASR-TTS pipeline to eliminate speaker-specific style while\npreserving meaning. We present results in a long-form telephone conversation\nsetting demonstrating the effectiveness of a content-based attack on\nvoice-anonymized speech. Then we show how the proposed content-based\nanonymization methods can mitigate this risk while preserving speech utility.\nOverall, we find that paraphrasing is an effective defense against\ncontent-based attacks and recommend that stakeholders adopt this step to ensure\nanonymity in long-form audio."}

However, a significant gap exists where\na model's strong visual understanding often fails to transfer to its visual\ngeneration. A model might correctly understand an image based on user\ninstructions, yet be unable to generate a faithful image from text prompts.\nThis phenomenon directly raises a compelling question: Can a model achieve\nself-improvement by using its understanding module to reward its generation\nmodule? To bridge this gap and achieve self-improvement, we introduce SRUM, a\nself-rewarding post-training framework that can be directly applied to existing\nUMMs of various designs. SRUM creates a feedback loop where the model's own\nunderstanding module acts as an internal ``evaluator'', providing corrective\nsignals to improve its generation module, without requiring additional\nhuman-labeled data. To ensure this feedback is comprehensive, we designed a\nglobal-local dual reward system. To tackle the inherent structural complexity\nof images, this system offers multi-scale guidance: a \\textbf{global reward}\nensures the correctness of the overall visual semantics and layout, while a\n\\textbf{local reward} refines fine-grained, object-level fidelity. SRUM leads\nto powerful capabilities and shows strong generalization, boosting performance\non T2I-CompBench from 82.18 to \\textbf{88.37} and on T2I-ReasonBench from 43.82\nto \\textbf{46.75}. Overall, our work establishes a powerful new paradigm for\nenabling a UMMs' understanding module to guide and enhance its own generation\nvia self-rewarding."}
