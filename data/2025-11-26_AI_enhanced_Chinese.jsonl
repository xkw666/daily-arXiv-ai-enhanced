Recent approaches rely on expensive Large Language Model (LLM) inference for both entity linking and path ranking, limiting their practical deployment. Additionally, LLM-generated answers often lack verifiable grounding in structured knowledge. We present two complementary hybrid algorithms that address both efficiency and verifiability: (1) LLM-Guided Planning that uses a single LLM call to predict relation sequences executed via breadth-first search, achieving near-perfect accuracy (micro-F1 > 0.90) while ensuring all answers are grounded in the knowledge graph, and (2) Embedding-Guided Neural Search that eliminates LLM calls entirely by fusing text and graph embeddings through a lightweight 6.7M-parameter edge scorer, achieving over 100 times speedup with competitive accuracy. Through knowledge distillation, we compress planning capability into a 4B-parameter model that matches large-model performance at zero API cost. Evaluation on MetaQA demonstrates that grounded reasoning consistently outperforms ungrounded generation, with structured planning proving more transferable than direct answer generation. Our results show that verifiable multi-hop reasoning does not require massive models at inference time, but rather the right architectural inductive biases combining symbolic structure with learned representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u7b26\u53f7\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u591a\u8df3\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u95ee\u7b54", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u7b54\u6848\u4e0d\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u5e73\u8861\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027", "method": "1.

We maintain that road geometry is inherently curve-based and introduce the B\u00e9zier Graph, a differentiable parametric curve-based representation. The primary obstacle to this representation is to obtain the difficult-to-construct vector ground-truth (GT). We sidestep this bottleneck by reframing the task as a global optimization problem over the B\u00e9zier Graph. Our framework, DOGE, operationalizes this paradigm by learning a parametric B\u00e9zier Graph directly from segmentation masks, eliminating the need for curve GT. DOGE holistically optimizes the graph by alternating between two complementary modules: DiffAlign continuously optimizes geometry via differentiable rendering, while TopoAdapt uses discrete operators to refine its topology.

This study evaluates the faithfulness of LLM-generated explanations in the context of emotion classification in Persian, a low-resource language, by comparing the influential words identified by the model against those identified by human annotators. We assess faithfulness using confidence scores derived from token-level log-probabilities. Two prompting strategies, differing in the order of explanation and prediction (Predict-then-Explain and Explain-then-Predict), are tested for their impact on explanation faithfulness. Our results reveal that while LLMs achieve strong classification performance, their generated explanations often diverge from faithful reasoning, showing greater agreement with each other than with human judgments.

However, existing multimodal learning frameworks, focused on vision and language, lack physical consistency and overlook the intrinsic causal relationships among an object's geometry, material, vibration modes, and the sounds it produces. We introduce VibraVerse, a large-scale geometry-acoustics alignment dataset that explicitly bridges the causal chain from 3D geometry -> physical attributes -> modal parameters -> acoustic signals. Each 3D model has explicit physical properties (density, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio) and volumetric geometry, from which modal eigenfrequencies and eigenvectors are computed for impact sound synthesis under controlled excitations. To establish this coherence, we introduce CLASP, a contrastive learning framework for cross-modal alignment that preserves the causal correspondence between an object's physical structure and its acoustic response. This framework enforces physically consistent alignment across modalities, ensuring that every sample is coherent, traceable to the governing equations, and embedded within a unified representation space spanning shape, image, and sound. Built upon VibraVerse, we define a suite of benchmark tasks for geometry-to-sound prediction, sound-guided shape reconstruction, and cross-modal representation learning. Extensive validations on these tasks demonstrate that models trained on VibraVerse exhibit superior accuracy, interpretability, and generalization across modalities. These results establish VibraVerse as a benchmark for physically consistent and causally interpretable multimodal learning, providing a foundation for sound-guided embodied perception and a deeper understanding of the physical world.

This study evaluates ten transformer-based embedding models adapted for cardiology through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning on 106,535 cardiology text pairs derived from authoritative medical textbooks. Results demonstrate that encoder-only architectures, particularly BioLinkBERT, achieve superior domain-specific performance (separation score: 0.510) compared to larger decoder-based models, while requiring significantly fewer computational resources. The findings challenge the assumption that larger language models necessarily produce better domain-specific embeddings and provide practical guidance for clinical NLP system development.

Recent research has explored motion controllability as a means to enhance text-to-video generation or image animation; however, we identify precise motion control as a promising yet under-explored paradigm for editing existing videos. In this work, we propose modifying video motion by directly editing sparse trajectories extracted from the input. We term the deviation between input and output trajectories a \"motion edit\" and demonstrate that this representation, when coupled with a generative backbone, enables powerful video editing capabilities. To achieve this, we introduce a pipeline for generating \"motion counterfactuals\", video pairs that share identical content but distinct motion, and we fine-tune a motion-conditioned video diffusion architecture on this dataset. Our approach allows for edits that start at any timestamp and propagate naturally. In a four-way head-to-head user study, our model achieves over 65 percent preference against prior work.

While many of the sentiment analysis systems are developed for English, many African languages are classified as low-resource languages due to the lack of digital language resources like text labelled with corresponding sentiment classes. One reason for that is that manually labelling text data is time-consuming and expensive. Consequently, automatic and rapid processes are needed to reduce the manual effort as much as possible making the labelling process as efficient as possible. In this paper, we present and analyze an automatic language-independent sentiment labelling method that leverages information from sentiment-bearing emojis and words. Our experiments are conducted with tweets in the languages English, Sepedi and Setswana from SAfriSenti, a multilingual sentiment corpus for South African languages. We show that our sentiment labelling approach is able to label the English tweets with an accuracy of 66%, the Sepedi tweets with 69%, and the Setswana tweets with 63%, so that on average only 34% of the automatically generated labels remain to be corrected.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8868\u60c5\u7b26\u53f7\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u8bcd\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8bed\u8a00\u65e0\u5173\u60c5\u611f\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u975e\u6d32\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u96c6SAfriSenti\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u82f1\u8bed66%\u3001Sepedi 69%\u3001Setswana 63%\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u4ec5\u9700\u4fee\u6b6334%\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u7ed3\u679c", "motivation": "\u975e\u6d32\u8bed\u8a00\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u3002\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6807\u6ce8\u6d41\u7a0b\u964d\u4f4e\u4eba\u5de5\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6807\u6ce8\u6548\u7387", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u8868\u60c5\u7b26\u53f7\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u8bcd\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u65e0\u5173\u7279\u5f81\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u5305\u542b\u82f1\u8bed/Sepedi/Setswana\u7684\u5357\u975e\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u6587\u8bed\u6599\u5e93SAfriSenti\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1", "result": "\u82f1\u8bed\u63a8\u6587\u6807\u6ce8\u51c6\u786e\u738766%\uff0cSepedi\u8fbe69%\uff0cSetswana\u4e3a63%\u3002\u6574\u4f53\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u7ed3\u679c\u5e73\u5747\u4ec5\u9700\u4fee\u6b6334%\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u6807\u6ce8", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00NLP\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u975e\u6d32\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u8fdb\u7a0b"}}

While previous studies have explored using prompts to elicit specific personality traits in LLMs, they have not optimized these prompts to maximize personality expression. To address this limitation, we propose PersonaPulse: Dynamic Profile Optimization for Realistic Personality Expression in LLMs, a framework that leverages LLMs' inherent knowledge of personality traits to iteratively enhance role-play prompts while integrating a situational response benchmark as a scoring tool, ensuring a more realistic and contextually grounded evaluation to guide the optimization process. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that the prompts generated by PersonaPulse outperform those of prior work, which were designed based on personality descriptions from psychological studies. Additionally, we explore the relationship between model size and personality modeling through extensive experiments. Finally, we find that, for certain personality traits, the extent of personality evocation can be partially controlled by pausing the optimization process.

We measured performance using accuracy, recall, false-positive rate (FPR), and an aggregate score of ROUGE-1, BLEURT, and BERTScore for error correction. We also analyzed example outputs to identify failure modes and differences between LLM and clinician reasoning.\n  Results: Zero-shot prompting showed low recall in both detection tasks, often missing abbreviation-heavy or atypical errors. SPR improved recall but increased FPR. Across all nine LLMs, RDP reduced FPR by about 15 percent, improved recall by 5 to 10 percent in error sentence detection, and generated more contextually accurate corrections.\n  Conclusion: Across diverse LLMs, RDP outperforms zero-shot and SPR prompting.

For CUAs to operate effectively, application selection, which refers to deciding which application to use before invoking fine-grained tools such as APIs, is a fundamental capability. It determines whether the agent initializes the correct environment, avoids orchestration confusion, and efficiently focuses on relevant context. However, existing benchmarks primarily assess fine-grained API selection, offering limited insight into whether models can reason across and choose between different applications. To fill this gap, we introduce AppSelectBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating application selection in CUAs. AppSelectBench contains a novel user task generation pipeline that produces realistic, diverse, and semantically grounded user intents at scale, together with unified evaluation protocols covering random, heuristic, zero-shot, few-shot, and retrieval-augmented-settings. AppSelectBench covers one hundred widely used desktop applications and includes more than one hundred thousand realistic, diverse, and semantically grounded user tasks. Extensive experiments across both closed-source and open-source large language models reveal systematic strengths and weaknesses in inter-application reasoning, showing that even the most capable models still struggle to make consistent application choices. Together, these results establish AppSelectBench as a foundation for studying and advancing application level reasoning, an essential yet underexplored capability of intelligent CUAs.

However, generalist models miss domain-specific nuances in high-stakes fields like finance and law, and naive fine-tuning causes surface-form overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. To address this challenge, we introduce R2R, a domain-aware framework that combines dynamic expert routing with a two-stage training strategy, Entity Abstraction for Generalization (EAG). EAG introduces a counter-shortcut mechanism by masking the most predictive surface cues, forcing the reranker to learn domain-invariant relevance patterns rather than memorizing dataset-specific entities. To efficiently activate domain experts, R2R employs a lightweight Latent Semantic Router that probes internal representations from the frozen backbone decoder to select the optimal LoRA expert per query. Extensive experiments across different reranker backbones and diverse domains (legal, medical, and financial) demonstrate that R2R consistently surpasses generalist and single-domain fine-tuned baselines.

Code available at https://github.com/mihirs-0/synass", "summary": "Transformers are theoretically reversal-invariant: their function class does not prefer left-to-right over right-to-left mappings. Yet empirical studies on natural language repeatedly report a \"reversal curse,\" and recent work on temporal asymmetry in LLMs suggests that real-world corpora carry their own arrow of time. This leaves an unresolved question: do directional failures stem from linguistic statistics, or from the architecture itself? We cut through this ambiguity with a fully synthetic, entropy-controlled benchmark designed as a clean-room stress test for directional learning. Using random string mappings with tunable branching factor K, we construct forward tasks with zero conditional entropy and inverse tasks with analytically determined entropy floors. Excess loss above these floors reveals that even scratch-trained GPT-2 models exhibit a strong, reproducible directional optimization gap (e.g., 1.16 nats at K=5), far larger than that of an MLP trained on the same data. Pre-trained initializations shift optimization behavior but do not eliminate this gap, while LoRA encounters a sharp capacity wall on high-entropy inverse mappings. Together, these results isolate a minimal, semantics-free signature of directional friction intrinsic to causal Transformer training-one that persists even when linguistic priors, token frequencies, and corpus-level temporal asymmetries are removed. Our benchmark provides a controlled instrument for dissecting directional biases in modern sequence models and motivates deeper mechanistic study of why inversion remains fundamentally harder for Transformers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b8c\u5168\u5408\u6210\u7684\u71b5\u63a7\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5373\u4fbf\u79fb\u9664\u8bed\u8a00\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u8bed\u6599\u65f6\u5e8f\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u56e0\u679cTransformer\u5728\u9006\u5411\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u5dee\u8ddd\uff081.16 nats@K=5\uff09\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u67b6\u6784\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u6469\u64e6\u673a\u5236", "motivation": "\u5398\u6e05Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u539f\u56e0\uff1a\u662f\u6e90\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\u8fd8\u662f\u67b6\u6784\u56fa\u6709\u7f3a\u9677\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u96f6\u8bed\u8a00\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u9694\u79bb\u73b0\u5b9e\u8bed\u6599\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5e72\u6270", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u8c03\u5206\u652f\u56e0\u5b50K\u7684\u968f\u673a\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u6620\u5c04\u6784\u5efa\uff1a1\uff09\u96f6\u6761\u4ef6\u71b5\u7684\u6b63\u5411\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b2\uff09\u5e26\u89e3\u6790\u71b5\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u9006\u5411\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u5bf9\u6bd4scratch-trained GPT-2\u3001MLP\u3001\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u53caLoRA\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u71b5\u503c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1\uff09\u539f\u59cbGPT-2\u9006\u5411\u4efb\u52a1\u635f\u5931\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e\u71b5\u57fa\uff08K=5\u65f61.16nats\u5dee\u8ddd\uff09\uff1b2\uff09MLP\u65e0\u6b64\u65b9\u5411\u5dee\u8ddd\uff1b3\uff09\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ec5\u6539\u53d8\u4f18\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0d\u6d88\u9664\u5dee\u8ddd\uff1b4\uff09LoRA\u5728\u9ad8\u538b\u4efb\u52a1\u906d\u9047\u5bb9\u91cf\u5899", "conclusion": "\u56e0\u679cTransformer\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b58\u5728\u67b6\u6784\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u6469\u64e6\u673a\u5236\u3002\u8be5\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u89e3\u6784\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u504f\u7f6e\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u51c6\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u9006\u5411\u5b66\u4e60\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u6839\u672c\u6027\u67b6\u6784\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u673a\u68b0\u8bba\u7814\u7a76"}}

We conducted a comprehensive evaluation comparing traditional lexical models, hybrid approaches, and several end-to-end fine-tuned transformers. Our results demonstrate that end-to-end fine-tuning is critical for performance, with the domain-adapted MentalBERT emerging as the top model, achieving an accuracy of 0.92 and a Macro F1 score of 0.76, surpassing both its generic counterpart and a zero-shot LLM baseline. Grounded in a comprehensive ethical analysis, we frame the system as a human-in-the-loop screening aid, not a diagnostic tool. To support this, we introduce a hybrid SHAPLLM explainability framework and present a prototype dashboard (\"Social Media Screener\") designed to integrate model predictions and their explanations into a practical workflow for moderators.

However, the prevalent approach of fine-tuning a separate module for each user faces two major limitations: (1) storage costs scale linearly with the number of users, rendering the method unscalable; and (2) fine-tuning a static model from scratch often yields suboptimal performance for users with sparse data. To address these challenges, we propose MTA, a Merge-then-Adapt framework for PLLMs. MTA comprises three key stages. First, we construct a shared Meta-LoRA Bank by selecting anchor users and pre-training meta-personalization traits within meta-LoRA modules. Second, to ensure scalability and enable dynamic personalization combination beyond static models, we introduce an Adaptive LoRA Fusion stage. This stage retrieves and dynamically merges the most relevant anchor meta-LoRAs to synthesize a user-specific one, thereby eliminating the need for user-specific storage and supporting more flexible personalization.

However, existing approaches face key limitations: answer choices are typically presented to LLMs without contextual grounding or explanation. This absence of context can lead to incomplete exploration of all possible answers, ultimately degrading the models' reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce BiasPrompting, a novel inference framework that guides LLMs to generate and critically evaluate reasoning across all plausible answer options before reaching a final prediction. It consists of two components: first, a reasoning generation stage, where the model is prompted to produce supportive reasonings for each answer option, and then, a reasoning-guided agreement stage, where the generated reasonings are synthesized to select the most plausible answer. Through comprehensive evaluations, BiasPrompting demonstrates significant improvements in five widely used multiple-choice question answering benchmarks.

Sparse attention mitigates this cost by restricting each query to attend to a subset of previous tokens; however, training-free approaches often lead to severe performance degradation. Native sparse-attention methods (e.g., NSA, MoBA) alleviate this issue, yet exhibit a critical paradox: they produce lower attention sparsity than full-attention models, despite aiming to approximate full attention, which may constrain their effectiveness. We attribute this paradox to gradient update deficiency: low-ranked key-value pairs excluded during sparse training receive neither forward contribution nor backward gradients, and thus never learn proper suppression. To overcome this limitation, we propose SSA (Sparse Sparse Attention), a unified training framework that considers both sparse and full attention and enforces bidirectional alignment at every layer. This design preserves gradient flow to all tokens while explicitly encouraging sparse-attention outputs to align with their full-attention counterparts, thereby promoting stronger sparsity. As a result, SSA achieves state-of-the-art performance under both sparse and full attention inference across multiple commonsense benchmarks. Furthermore, SSA enables models to adapt smoothly to varying sparsity budgets; performance improves consistently as more tokens are allowed to attend, supporting flexible compute-performance trade-offs at inference time. Finally, we show that native sparse-attention training surprisingly improves long-context extrapolation by mitigating the over-allocation of attention values in sink areas, with SSA demonstrating the strongest extrapolation capability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSSA\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u7f3a\u9677\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u53cc\u4f18\u5316", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u539f\u751f\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u7f3a\u9677\uff08\u88ab\u6392\u9664\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u952e\u503c\u5bf9\u65e0\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\uff09\u548c\u6548\u7387\u6096\u8bba\uff08\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u4f4e\u4e8e\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\uff09", "method": "SSA\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8def\u5f84 2\uff09\u6bcf\u5c42\u5f3a\u5236\u53cc\u5411\u5bf9\u9f50 3\uff09\u4fdd\u6301\u6240\u6709token\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u52a8", "result": "\u5728\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\uff1b\u652f\u6301\u52a8\u6001\u7a00\u758f\u9884\u7b97\uff08\u6027\u80fd\u968ftoken\u6570\u589e\u52a0\u7ebf\u6027\u63d0\u5347\uff09\uff1b\u5c55\u793a\u6700\u5f3a\u7684\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5916\u63a8\u80fd\u529b", "conclusion": "SSA\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u4fdd\u7559\u673a\u5236\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a00\u758f\u8bad\u7ec3\u8d85\u8d8a\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97-\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\u63d0\u4f9b\u7075\u6d3b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

The primary difficulty lies in text segmentation, as traditional methods often missegment or entirely miss cross-sentence discontinuous entities, significantly affecting recognition accuracy. Therefore, we aim to address the segmentation and omission issues associated with such entities. Recent studies have shown that grid-tagging methods are effective for information extraction due to their flexible tagging schemes and robust architectures. Building on this, we integrate image data augmentation techniques, such as cropping, scaling, and padding, into grid-based models to enhance their ability to recognize discontinuous entities and handle segmentation challenges. Experimental results demonstrate that traditional segmentation methods often fail to capture cross-sentence discontinuous entities, leading to decreased performance. In contrast, our augmented grid models achieve notable improvements.

However, existing large language model-based (LLM-based) approaches often rely heavily on external knowledge sources, introducing substantial latency and even hallucinations that undermine reliability, interpretability, and responsiveness, which is crucial for real-time use. To address these challenges, we propose REason-guided Fact-checking with Latent EXplanations REFLEX paradigm, a plug-and-play, self-refining paradigm that leverages the internal knowledge in backbone model to improve both verdict accuracy and explanation quality. REFLEX reformulates fact-checking as a role-play dialogue and jointly trains verdict prediction and explanation generation. It adaptively extracts contrastive activation pairs between the backbone model and its fine-tuned variant to construct steering vectors that disentangle truth into style and substance naturally. These activation-level signals guide inference and suppress noisy explanations, enabling more faithful and efficient reasoning. Experiments on real-world datasets show that REFLEX outperforms previous methods that steer toward a single truth direction and underscores the challenge traditional approaches face when handling the subtle, human-unknown truth in fact-checking tasks. Remarkably, with only 465 self-refined training samples, RELFEX achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, models trained with explanatory objectives can effectively guide those without them, yielding up to a 7.57% improvement, highlighting that internal explanation signals play a dual role in both interpreting and enhancing factual reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faREFLEX\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5411\u91cf\u89e3\u8026\u771f\u7406\u98ce\u683c\u4e0e\u672c\u8d28\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u63d0\u5347\u67e5\u8bc1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700465\u4e2a\u81ea\u4f18\u5316\u6837\u672c\u5373\u5b9e\u73b0SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u67e5\u8bc1\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u635f\u5bb3\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ed3\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u89e3\u91ca\u751f\u6210\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u53d6\u4e3b\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5fae\u8c03\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5bf9\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u7136\u89e3\u8026\u771f\u7406\u98ce\u683c\u4e0e\u672c\u8d28\u7684\u8f6c\u5411\u5411\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u5355\u65b9\u5411\u771f\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u975e\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u578b7.57%\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4fe1\u53f7\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0e\u566a\u58f0\u6291\u5236\u53cc\u91cd\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u89e3\u91ca\u4fe1\u53f7\u5177\u6709\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0e\u89e3\u91ca\u751f\u6210\u53cc\u91cd\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u81ea\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u7a81\u7834\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u4eba\u7c7b\u672a\u77e5\u5fae\u5999\u771f\u7406\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Current speculative decoding methods typically assume a considerable amount of available computing power, then generate a complex and massive draft tree using a small autoregressive language model to improve overall prediction accuracy. However, methods like batching have been widely applied in mainstream model inference systems as a superior alternative to speculative decoding, as they compress the available idle computing power. Therefore, performing speculative decoding with low verification resources and low scheduling costs has become an important research problem. We believe that more capable models that allow for parallel generation on draft sequences are what we truly need. Recognizing the fundamental nature of draft models to only generate sequences of limited length, we propose SpecFormer, a novel architecture that integrates unidirectional and bidirectional attention mechanisms. SpecFormer combines the autoregressive model's ability to extract information from the entire input sequence with the parallel generation benefits of non-autoregressive models.

While prior work has shown that LLMs can represent task patterns and surface-level concepts, it remains unclear whether these models can encode high-level relational concepts and apply them to novel situations through structured comparisons. In this work, we explore this fundamental aspect using proportional and story analogies, and identify three key findings. First, LLMs effectively encode the underlying relationships between analogous entities; both attributive and relational information propagate through mid-upper layers in correct cases, whereas reasoning failures reflect missing relational information within these layers. Second, unlike humans, LLMs often struggle not only when relational information is missing, but also when attempting to apply it to new entities. In such cases, strategically patching hidden representations at critical token positions can facilitate information transfer to a certain extent. Lastly, successful analogical reasoning in LLMs is marked by strong structural alignment between analogous situations, whereas failures often reflect degraded or misplaced alignment. Overall, our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit emerging but limited capabilities in encoding and applying high-level relational concepts, highlighting both parallels and gaps with human cognition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u9ad8\u7ea7\u5173\u7cfb\u6982\u5ff5\u65b9\u9762\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u4fe1\u606f\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2d\u4e0a\u5c42\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u5931\u8d25\u6848\u4f8b\u5219\u53cd\u6620\u5173\u7cfb\u4fe1\u606f\u7f3a\u5931\u6216\u5e94\u7528\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22LLMs\u662f\u5426\u5177\u5907\u7f16\u7801\u9ad8\u5c42\u7ea7\u5173\u7cfb\u6982\u5ff5\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6bd4\u8f83\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u65b0\u60c5\u5883\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6b64\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4ec5\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5176\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u8868\u5c42\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u638c\u63e1\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7c7b\u6bd4\u548c\u6545\u4e8b\u7c7b\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u5c42\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9690\u85cf\u8868\u5f81\u4fee\u8865\u6280\u672f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5173\u952etoken\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "1.

However, evaluating stemming methods is challenging because current evaluation approaches are limited and do not capture the potential harm caused by excessive stemming; therefore, it is essential to develop new approaches to evaluate stemming methods. To address this issue, this study propose a novel, task-oriented approach to evaluate stemming methods, which considers three aspects: (1) the utility of stemming using Stemming Effectiveness Score (SES), (2) the impact of stemming on downstream tasks using Model Performance Delta (MPD), and (3) the semantic similarity between stemmed and original words using Average Normalized Levenshtein Distance (ANLD), thus providing a comprehensive evaluation framework. We apply our evaluation framework to compare two stemmers for Bangla (BNLTK) and English (Snowball), and our results reveal a significant issue, prompting us to analyze their performance in detail. While the Bangla stemmer achieves the highest SES (1.67) due to effective word reduction (CR = 1.90), SES alone is insufficient because our proposed safety measure, ANLD, reveals that this high SES is due to harmful over-stemming (ANLD = 0.26), which correlates with the observed decrease in downstream performance.In contrast, the English stemmer achieves a moderate SES (1.31) with a safe meaning distance (ANLD = 0.14), allowing its word reduction to contribute positively to downstream performance; therefore, it is a more reliable stemmer. Our study provides a valuable tool for distinguishing between potential efficiency gains (high SES) and meaning preservation (low ANLD).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6(SES/MPD/ANLD)\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u867d\u6709\u6548\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u5ea6\u63d0\u53d6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u82f1\u8bed\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u66f4\u53ef\u9760", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8861\u91cf\u8fc7\u5ea6\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u5371\u5bb3\uff0c\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u7cfb", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u6027\u8bc4\u5206(SES)\u3001\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u5f71\u54cd(MPD)\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6(ANLD)\u4e09\u6307\u6807\u6784\u5efa\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed(BNLTK)\u548c\u82f1\u8bed(Snowball)\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\u5668", "result": "\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed\u63d0\u53d6\u5668SES\u6700\u9ad8(1.67)\u4f46ANLD\u4f4e(0.26)\u663e\u793a\u6709\u5bb3\u8fc7\u5ea6\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u82f1\u8bed\u63d0\u53d6\u5668SES\u9002\u4e2d(1.31)\u4e14ANLD\u5b89\u5168(0.14)\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18", "conclusion": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u8bcd\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u7559\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u9ad8SES\u9700\u914d\u5408\u4f4eANLD\u624d\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd"}}

Two challenges, however, remain central: training generative models when no paired data exist, and evaluating stylistic text without relying only on human judgment. In this work, we present a framework for both generating and evaluating sentences in the style of 19th-century novelists. Large language models are fine-tuned with minimal, single-token prompts to produce text in the voices of authors such as Dickens, Austen, Twain, Alcott, and Melville. To assess these generative models, we employ a transformer-based detector trained on authentic sentences, using it both as a classifier and as a tool for stylistic explanation.

Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques can facilitate the automatic detection of these discourse features, offering educational researchers scalable and data-driven insights.

Evaluating large language models' (LLMs) alignment typically involves directly assessing their open-ended responses, requiring human annotators or strong LLM judges. Conversely, LLMs themselves have also been extensively evaluated as judges for assessing alignment. In this work, we examine the relationship between LLMs' generation and evaluation capabilities in aligning with human preferences. To this end, we first conduct a comprehensive analysis of the generation-evaluation consistency (GE-consistency) among various LLMs, revealing a strong correlation between their generation and evaluation capabilities when evaluated by a strong LLM preference oracle. Utilizing this finding, we propose a benchmarking paradigm that measures LLM alignment with human preferences without directly evaluating their generated outputs, instead assessing LLMs in their role as evaluators. Our evaluation shows that our proposed benchmark, AlignEval, matches or surpasses widely used automatic LLM evaluation benchmarks, such as AlpacaEval and Arena-Hard, in capturing human preferences when ranking LLMs. Our study offers valuable insights into the connection between LLMs' generation and evaluation capabilities, and introduces a benchmark that assesses alignment without directly evaluating model outputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAlignEval\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\u800c\u975e\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u5176\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u51c6", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6216\u5f3aLLM\u8bc4\u5224\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f", "method": "1. \u5206\u6790LLM\u751f\u6210-\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e00\u81f4\u6027(GE-consistency) 2. \u5f00\u53d1AlignEval\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u8861\u91cf\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a0b\u5ea6", "result": "AlignEval\u5728LLM\u6392\u5e8f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bf9\u4eba\u5de5\u504f\u597d\u7684\u6355\u6349\u6548\u679c\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8d8aAlpacaEval/Arena-Hard\u7b49\u4e3b\u6d41\u57fa\u51c6", "conclusion": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LLM\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5173\u8054\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u9700\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2"}}

While existing LLM agents depend on text-based mediation for reasoning and communication, we take a step forward by enabling models to collaborate directly within the continuous latent space. We introduce LatentMAS, an end-to-end training-free framework that enables pure latent collaboration among LLM agents. In LatentMAS, each agent first performs auto-regressive latent thoughts generation through last-layer hidden embeddings. A shared latent working memory then preserves and transfers each agent's internal representations, ensuring lossless information exchange. We provide theoretical analyses establishing that LatentMAS attains higher expressiveness and lossless information preservation with substantially lower complexity than vanilla text-based MAS. In addition, empirical evaluations across 9 comprehensive benchmarks spanning math and science reasoning, commonsense understanding, and code generation show that LatentMAS consistently outperforms strong single-model and text-based MAS baselines, achieving up to 14.6% higher accuracy, reducing output token usage by 70.8%-83.7%, and providing 4x-4.3x faster end-to-end inference.

Both areas are typically evaluated with informal evidence and ad-hoc experiments, with few explicit guarantees about how far an extracted or edited model can drift from the original on relevant inputs. We introduce BlockCert, a framework for certified blockwise extraction of transformer mechanisms, and outline how a lightweight extension can support certified local edits. Given a pre-trained transformer and a prompt distribution, BlockCert extracts structured surrogate implementations for residual blocks together with machine-checkable certificates that bound approximation error, record coverage metrics, and hash the underlying artifacts. We formalize a simple Lipschitz-based composition theorem in Lean 4 that lifts these local guarantees to a global deviation bound. Empirically, we apply the framework to GPT-2 small, TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat, and Llama-3.2-3B. Across these models we obtain high per-block coverage and small residual errors on the evaluated prompts, and in the TinyLlama setting we show that a fully stitched model matches the baseline perplexity within approximately 6e-5 on stress prompts.

Prior work relies on accuracy-based approaches, interpreting performance drops after removing a modality as indicative of its influence. However, such outcome-driven metrics fail to distinguish whether a modality is inherently informative or whether its value arises only through interaction with other modalities. This distinction is particularly important in cross-attention architectures, where modalities influence each other's representations. In this work, we propose a framework based on Partial Information Decomposition (PID) that quantifies modality contributions by decomposing predictive information in internal embeddings into unique, redundant, and synergistic components. To enable scalable, inference-only analysis, we develop an algorithm based on the Iterative Proportional Fitting Procedure (IPFP) that computes layer and dataset-level contributions without retraining.

Heritage institutions worldwide have digitized more than one million maps, and automated techniques now enable large-scale recognition and extraction of map content. Yet these methods have engaged little with the history of cartography, or the view that maps are semantic-symbolic systems, and cultural objects reflecting political and epistemic expectations. This work leverages a diverse corpus of 771,561 map records and 99,715 digitized images aggregated from 38 digital catalogs. After normalization, the dataset includes 236,925 contributors and spans six centuries, from 1492 to 1948. These data make it possible to chart geographic structures and the global chronology of map publication. The spatial focus of cartography is analyzed in relation to political dynamics, evidencing links between Atlantic maritime charting, the triangular trade, and colonial expansion. Further results document the progression of national, domestic focus and the impact of military conflicts on publication volumes. The research introduces semantic segmentation techniques and object detection models for the generic recognition of land classes and cartographic signs, trained on annotated data and synthetic images. The analysis of land classes shows that maps are designed images whose framing and composition emphasize features through centering and semantic symmetries. The study of cartographic figuration encodes 63 M signs and 25 M fragments into a latent visual space, revealing figurative shifts such as the replacement of relief hachures by terrain contours and showing that signs tend to form locally consistent systems.

Low-diversity models tend to generate repetitive outputs, increasing sampling redundancy and hindering both creative exploration and downstream applications. A primary cause is that generation often collapses toward a strong mode in the learned distribution. Existing attempts to improve diversity, such as noise resampling, prompt rewriting, or steering-based guidance, often still collapse to dominant modes or introduce distortions that degrade image quality. In light of this, we propose Token-Prompt embedding Space Optimization (TPSO), a training-free and model-agnostic module. TPSO introduces learnable parameters to explore underrepresented regions of the token embedding space, reducing the tendency of the model to repeatedly generate samples from strong modes of the learned distribution. At the same time, the prompt-level space provides a global semantic constraint that regulates distribution shifts, preventing quality degradation while maintaining high fidelity. Extensive experiments on MS-COCO and three diffusion backbones show that TPSO significantly enhances generative diversity, improving baseline performance from 1.10 to 4.18 points, without sacrificing image quality.

Existing fixes -- freezing modules or applying uniform regularization -- either overconstrain adaptation or ignore the differing roles of VLA components. We present MAPS (Module-Wise Proximity Scheduling), the first robust fine-tuning framework for VLAs. Through systematic analysis, we uncover an empirical order in which proximity constraints should be relaxed to balance stability and flexibility. MAPS linearly schedules this relaxation, enabling visual encoders to stay close to their pretrained priors while action-oriented language layers adapt more freely.

However, their capability for counterfactual reasoning, inferring alternative outcomes under hypothetical conditions, remains underexplored. This capability is essential for robust video understanding, as it requires identifying underlying causal structures and reasoning about unobserved possibilities, rather than merely recognizing observed patterns. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce CounterVQA, a video-based benchmark featuring three progressive difficulty levels that assess different aspects of counterfactual reasoning. Through comprehensive evaluation of both state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source models, we uncover a substantial performance gap: while these models achieve reasonable accuracy on simple counterfactual questions, performance degrades significantly on complex multi-hop causal chains. To address these limitations, we develop a post-training method, CFGPT, that enhances a model's visual counterfactual reasoning ability by distilling its counterfactual reasoning capability from the language modality, yielding consistent improvements across all CounterVQA difficulty levels.

While LLMs offer promise for automation, both general-purpose and finetuned LLMs suffer from two fundamental and conflicting limitations: correctness and efficiency. The key reason is that existing LLM-based approaches directly generate the entire optimized low-level programs, requiring exploration of an extremely vast space encompassing both optimization policies and implementation codes. To address the challenge of exploring an intractable space, we propose Macro Thinking Micro Coding (MTMC), a hierarchical framework inspired by the staged optimization strategy of human experts. It decouples optimization strategy from implementation details, ensuring efficiency through high-level strategy and correctness through low-level implementation. Specifically, Macro Thinking employs reinforcement learning to guide lightweight LLMs in efficiently exploring and learning semantic optimization strategies that maximize hardware utilization. Micro Coding leverages general-purpose LLMs to incrementally implement the stepwise optimization proposals from Macro Thinking, avoiding full-kernel generation errors. Together, they effectively navigate the vast optimization space and intricate implementation details, enabling LLMs for high-performance GPU kernel generation. Comprehensive results on widely adopted benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of MTMC on GPU kernel generation in both accuracy and running time. On KernelBench, MTMC achieves near 100% and 70% accuracy at Levels 1-2 and 3, over 50% than SOTA general-purpose and domain-finetuned LLMs, with up to 7.3x speedup over LLMs, and 2.2x over expert-optimized PyTorch Eager kernels.

While all tested models were susceptible to emergent misalignment, some models showed more resistance than others. Specifically the Qwen-2.5 family proved to be relatively resistant, while GPT-4o exhibited the strongest misalignment. In this paper we evaluate if current-generation open-weights models exhibit similar resistance to the Qwen-2.5 family and measure misalignment robustness over a range of model architectures and scales.\n  We replicate the effect across nine modern open-weights models (Gemma 3 and Qwen 3 families, 1B-32B parameters).

In this work, we introduce a more fine-grained perspective that decomposes these components into orthogonal singular directions, revealing superposed and independent computations within a single head or MLP. We validate our perspective on widely used standard tasks like Indirect Object Identification (IOI), Gender Pronoun (GP), and Greater Than (GT), showing that previously identified canonical functional heads, such as the name mover, encode multiple overlapping subfunctions aligned with distinct singular directions. Nodes in a computational graph, that are previously identified as circuit elements show strong activation along specific low-rank directions, suggesting that meaningful computations reside in compact subspaces.

Token-level importance ratios often exhibit high variance-a phenomenon exacerbated in Mixture-of-Experts models-leading to unstable updates. Existing group-based policy optimization methods, such as GSPO and GRPO, alleviate this problem via hard clipping, making it difficult to maintain both stability and effective learning. We propose Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO), which replaces hard clipping with a smooth, temperature-controlled gate that adaptively attenuates off-policy updates while preserving useful learning signals. Compared with GSPO and GRPO, SAPO is both sequence-coherent and token-adaptive. Like GSPO, SAPO maintains sequence-level coherence, but its soft gating forms a continuous trust region that avoids the brittle hard clipping band used in GSPO. When a sequence contains a few highly off-policy tokens, GSPO suppresses all gradients for that sequence, whereas SAPO selectively down-weights only the offending tokens and preserves the learning signal from the near-on-policy ones, improving sample efficiency. Relative to GRPO, SAPO replaces hard token-level clipping with smooth, temperature-controlled scaling, enabling more informative and stable updates. Empirical results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks indicate that SAPO exhibits improved training stability and higher Pass@1 performance under comparable training budgets. Moreover, we employ SAPO to train the Qwen3-VL model series, demonstrating that SAPO yields consistent performance gains across diverse tasks and different model sizes.

Finetuning and benchmarking these generative models have often relied on datasets of human-annotated design preferences. Yet, due to the subjective and highly personalized nature of visual design, preference varies widely among individuals. In this paper, we study this problem by introducing DesignPref, a dataset of 12k pairwise comparisons of UI design generation annotated by 20 professional designers with multi-level preference ratings. We found that among trained designers, substantial levels of disagreement exist (Krippendorff's alpha = 0.25 for binary preferences). Natural language rationales provided by these designers indicate that disagreements stem from differing perceptions of various design aspect importance and individual preferences. With DesignPref, we demonstrate that traditional majority-voting methods for training aggregated judge models often do not accurately reflect individual preferences. To address this challenge, we investigate multiple personalization strategies, particularly fine-tuning or incorporating designer-specific annotations into RAG pipelines. Our results show that personalized models consistently outperform aggregated baseline models in predicting individual designers' preferences, even when using 20 times fewer examples.

From Analysis to Path Forward", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.CL"], "comment": null, "summary": "Recent years have witnessed significant progress in Unified Multimodal Models, yet a fundamental question remains: Does understanding truly inform generation? To investigate this, we introduce UniSandbox, a decoupled evaluation framework paired with controlled, synthetic datasets to avoid data leakage and enable detailed analysis. Our findings reveal a significant understanding-generation gap, which is mainly reflected in two key dimensions: reasoning generation and knowledge transfer. Specifically, for reasoning generation tasks, we observe that explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in the understanding module effectively bridges the gap, and further demonstrate that a self-training approach can successfully internalize this ability, enabling implicit reasoning during generation. Additionally, for knowledge transfer tasks, we find that CoT assists the generative process by helping retrieve newly learned knowledge, and also discover that query-based architectures inherently exhibit latent CoT-like properties that affect this transfer. UniSandbox provides preliminary insights for designing future unified architectures and training strategies that truly bridge the gap between understanding and generation.
