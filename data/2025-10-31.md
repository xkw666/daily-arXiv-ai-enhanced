### [1] [StreetMath: Study of LLMs' Approximation Behaviors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25776)
*Chiung-Yi Tseng,Somshubhra Roy,Maisha Thasin,Danyang Zhang,Blessing Effiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出StreetMath基准测试，发现大语言模型在需要近似计算的场景中仍倾向精确计算，且精确与近似算术依赖不同神经组件，指出LLMs未展现人类认知吝啬特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究聚焦大语言模型的精确算术能力，但对其在非自回归架构中的快速近似推理能力研究不足，特别是在真实世界近似场景下的表现尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 开发StreetMath基准测试，评估Qwen3-4B-Instruct等不同架构模型，运用机制可解释性技术探查模型内部状态，分析计算策略与认知模式。

Result: LLMs在近似任务中仍尝试精确计算或调用工具；正确答案可能早期出现但消耗更多token；精确/近似运算依赖分离的神经组件。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在街头数学场景中未展现人类认知吝啬特征，开源项目推动相关研究。

Abstract: There is a substantial body of literature examining the mathematical
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
performance on precise arithmetic operations in autoregressive architectures.
However, their ability to perform approximate reasoning in informal, fast-paced
mathematical operations has received far less attention, especially among
non-autoregressive decoder models. Our work addresses this gap by introducing
StreetMath, a benchmark designed to evaluate models' approximation abilities
under real-world approximation scenarios. We conduct extensive evaluations
across different LLM architectures: Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507,
Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507, Dream-v0-Instruct-7B, Falcon-Mamba-7B-Instruct, and
Mamba-GPT-3B. Furthermore, we apply mechanistic interpretability techniques to
probe their internal computational states. Our analysis reveals that LLMs
generally attempt to compute exact values or invoke external tools even in
tasks that call for approximation. Moreover, while models sometimes reach the
correct answer in early layers or steps, they still consume more tokens when
solving approximation tasks. Additional experiments indicate that exact and
approximate arithmetic operations rely on largely separate neural components.
Drawing upon research on cognitive psychology, we argue that LLMs do not
exhibit cognitive miserliness in the same way humans do in street math
settings. We open source our work https://github.com/ctseng777/StreetMath

### [2] [Review Based Entity Ranking using Fuzzy Logic Algorithmic Approach: Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25778)
*Pratik N. Kalamkar,Anupama G. Phakatkar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出结合模糊逻辑和句法分析的意见强度分级方法，改进传统情感分析忽略意见粒度的缺陷


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于词典的情感分析未考虑意见强度差异（如强烈负面/微弱正面），导致实体评价排名不够精准

Method: 采用模糊逻辑算法分类意见词强度等级，结合句法依赖解析关联产品属性与意见词

Result: 实现基于多维强度分析的实体评分系统，可依据查询需求生成细粒度排名

Conclusion: 该方法通过强度分级显著提升了意见挖掘的语义解析精度和应用价值

Abstract: Opinion mining, also called sentiment analysis, is the field of study that
analyzes people opinions, sentiments, evaluations, appraisals, attitudes, and
emotions towards entities such as products, services, organizations,
individuals, issues, events, topics, and their attributes. Holistic
lexicon-based approach does not consider the strength of each opinion, i.e.,
whether the opinion is very strongly negative (or positive), strongly negative
(or positive), moderate negative (or positive), very weakly negative (or
positive) and weakly negative (or positive). In this paper, we propose approach
to rank entities based on orientation and strength of the entity reviews and
user's queries by classifying them in granularity levels (i.e. very weak, weak,
moderate, very strong and strong) by combining opinion words (i.e. adverb,
adjective, noun and verb) that are related to aspect of interest of certain
product. We shall use fuzzy logic algorithmic approach in order to classify
opinion words into different category and syntactic dependency resolution to
find relations for desired aspect words. Opinion words related to certain
aspects of interest are considered to find the entity score for that aspect in
the review.

### [3] [LASTIST: LArge-Scale Target-Independent STance dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25783)
*DongJae Kim,Yaejin Lee,Minsu Park,Eunil Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出首个大规模韩语目标无关立场检测数据集LASTIST（56.3万标注句子），支持立场演化追踪等任务并开源数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补韩语等低资源语言在目标无关立场检测领域的数据空白，解决现有研究过度依赖特定目标且集中于英语的局限性。

Method: 从韩国政党新闻稿收集数据，设计多任务适用标注体系，使用先进深度学习模型进行验证，并开源数据集。

Result: 建成56.3万句韩语标注数据集LASTIST，支持目标无关立场检测、历时立场演化分析等新型研究任务。

Conclusion: LASTIST数据集突破了目标依赖限制，为韩语立场检测研究提供基础设施，推动跨语言立场分析及动态演变研究。

Abstract: Stance detection has emerged as an area of research in the field of
artificial intelligence. However, most research is currently centered on the
target-dependent stance detection task, which is based on a person's stance in
favor of or against a specific target. Furthermore, most benchmark datasets are
based on English, making it difficult to develop models in low-resource
languages such as Korean, especially for an emerging field such as stance
detection. This study proposes the LArge-Scale Target-Independent STance
(LASTIST) dataset to fill this research gap. Collected from the press releases
of both parties on Korean political parties, the LASTIST dataset uses 563,299
labeled Korean sentences. We provide a detailed description of how we collected
and constructed the dataset and trained state-of-the-art deep learning and
stance detection models. Our LASTIST dataset is designed for various tasks in
stance detection, including target-independent stance detection and diachronic
evolution stance detection. We deploy our dataset on
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LASTIST-3721/.

### [4] [zFLoRA: Zero-Latency Fused Low-Rank Adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25784)
*Dhananjaya Gowda,Seoha Song,Harshith Goka,Junhyun Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出零延迟融合低秩适配器(zFLoRA)，在保持模型性能的同时消除传统适配器的额外延迟开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统适配器虽参数少(不足基础模型1%)，但会导致高达2.5倍的推理延迟增长，严重影响部署效率。

Method: 通过融合低秩适配器参数到基础模型，使用参数重参数化技术实现零额外计算图节点。

Result: 在1B/3B/7B模型上，18项任务(常识推理/数学推理/摘要对话)性能优于LoRA和FFT；NPU/GPU平台实测延迟增加0-2%。

Conclusion: zFLoRA首次实现适配器零延迟部署，为LLM高效适配提供实用解决方案，特别适合资源敏感场景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed with task-specific
adapters catering to multiple downstream applications. In such a scenario, the
additional compute associated with these apparently insignificant number of
adapter parameters (typically less than 1% of the base model) turns out to be
disproportionately significant during inference time (upto 2.5x times that of
the base model). In this paper, we propose a new zero-latency fused low-rank
adapter (zFLoRA) that introduces zero or negligible latency overhead on top of
the base model. Experimental results on LLMs of size 1B, 3B and 7B show that
zFLoRA compares favorably against the popular supervised fine-tuning benchmarks
including low-rank adapters (LoRA) as well as full fine-tuning (FFT).
Experiments are conducted on 18 different tasks across three different
categories namely commonsense reasoning, math reasoning and summary-dialogue.
Latency measurements made on NPU (Samsung Galaxy S25+) as well as GPU (NVIDIA
H100) platforms show that the proposed zFLoRA adapters introduce zero to
negligible latency overhead.

*Yaniv Nikankin,Dana Arad,Itay Itzhak,Anja Reusch,Adi Simhi,Gal Kesten-Pomeranz,Yonatan Belinkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于MIB基准的三项改进方法提升神经网络电路发现的忠实性和性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电路发现方法在归因一致性和选择策略上存在局限性，需要更可靠的机制解释方法

Method: 1. 自举法筛选稳定边 2. 比率选择策略平衡性能 3. 整数线性规划替代贪心算法

Result: 在多个MIB任务中生成更忠实电路，性能超越现有方法

Conclusion: 新方法为模型机制解释提供更可靠工具，代码开源促进领域发展

Abstract: One of the main challenges in mechanistic interpretability is circuit
discovery, determining which parts of a model perform a given task. We build on
the Mechanistic Interpretability Benchmark (MIB) and propose three key
improvements to circuit discovery. First, we use bootstrapping to identify
edges with consistent attribution scores. Second, we introduce a simple
ratio-based selection strategy to prioritize strong positive-scoring edges,
balancing performance and faithfulness. Third, we replace the standard greedy
selection with an integer linear programming formulation. Our methods yield
more faithful circuits and outperform prior approaches across multiple MIB
tasks and models. Our code is available at:

### [6] [LISTEN to Your Preferences: An LLM Framework for Multi-Objective Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25799)
*Adam S. Jovine,Tinghan Ye,Francis Bahk,Jingjing Wang,David B. Shmoys,Peter I. Frazier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出LISTEN框架，通过LLM实现自然语言指导的多目标决策，开发LISTEN-U（参数化效用函数）和LISTEN-T（非参数锦标赛法）两种算法，在航班预订等任务中验证有效性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决专家在多目标决策时难以形式化复杂偏好的痛点，传统偏好建模方法认知负担重

Method: LISTEN-U用LLM迭代优化参数化效用函数，LISTEN-T采用小批量锦标赛选择机制。提出concordance指标衡量参数对齐程度

Result: LISTEN-U在参数对齐场景表现优异（concordance高时），LISTEN-T在非参数场景更稳健。在航班/购物/考试调度任务验证有效性

Conclusion: 开创了用自然语言直接引导复杂决策的新范式，降低传统偏好建模的认知负担，为多目标优化提供新方向

Abstract: Human experts often struggle to select the best option from a large set of
items with multiple competing objectives, a process bottlenecked by the
difficulty of formalizing complex, implicit preferences. To address this, we
introduce LISTEN, a framework that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) as a
zero-shot preference oracle, guided only by an expert's high-level priorities
in natural language. To operate within LLM constraints like context windows and
inference costs, we propose two iterative algorithms: LISTEN-U, which uses the
LLM to refine a parametric utility function, and LISTEN-T, a non-parametric
method that performs tournament-style selections over small batches of
solutions. Evaluated on diverse tasks including flight booking, shopping, and
exam scheduling, our results show LISTEN-U excels when preferences are
parametrically aligned (a property we measure with a novel concordance metric),
while LISTEN-T offers more robust performance. This work explores a promising
direction for steering complex multi-objective decisions directly with natural
language, reducing the cognitive burden of traditional preference elicitation.

*Haoran Deng,Yingyu Lin,Zhenghao Lin,Xiao Liu,Yizhou Sun,Yi-An Ma,Yeyun Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出LongFilter框架用于高效筛选具有长距离依赖的训练数据，显著提升长上下文模型的性能表现


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长文本数据普遍缺乏有效长距离依赖，导致模型训练效率低下，需构建有效的数据筛选机制

Method: 通过对比模型在长/短上下文场景下的预测差异，量化信息增益来识别真正需要长程依赖的样本

Result: 在LLaMA-3-8B上将上下文扩展至64K，HELMET/ LongBench/RULER等基准取得显著提升

Conclusion: LongFilter成功实现数据质量与训练效率的平衡，为长上下文模型训练提供有效解决方案

Abstract: Long-context language models unlock advanced capabilities in reasoning, code
generation, and document summarization by leveraging dependencies across
extended spans of text. However, a significant portion of readily available
long-text data lacks meaningful long-distance dependencies; most spans can be
predicted using only local context. Training on such data is inefficient,
making careful data selection crucial. Therefore, we introduce LongFilter, a
framework for curating training data tailored to long-context pretraining.
LongFilter measures the information gain provided by extended context by
contrasting model predictions under long-context versus short-context settings,
thereby identifying samples where long-range dependencies are essential.
Experiments with LLaMA-3-8B, extending its context length from 8K to 64K, show
that LongFilter efficiently selects high-quality data and yields substantial
improvements on benchmarks such as HELMET, LongBench, and RULER.

### [8] [Ideology-Based LLMs for Content Moderation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25805)
*Stefano Civelli,Pietro Bernardelle,Nardiena A. Pratama,Gianluca Demartini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs在内容审核中的人物设定会引发意识形态偏见，大模型更倾向与同意识形态人物保持一致，影响判断公平性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs在内容审核系统中采用不同人物设定时，如何影响其有害内容分类的公平性与一致性，揭示表面中立性下潜在的意识形态偏差

Method: 通过对比不同架构/规模的LLM在语言/视觉模态下的分类表现，结合协议分析和政治定向任务，评估人物设定对模型判断的影响机制

Result: 人物设定导致判断分歧：同意识形态间一致性增强但跨群体差异扩大，大模型在政治任务中更倾向维护自身意识形态观点并弱化对立面危害性

Conclusion: 人物设定可能使LLMs输出隐含意识形态偏见，警示AI系统在保持表面中立时可能实际强化党派立场，呼吁加强算法公平性研究

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in content moderation
systems, where ensuring fairness and neutrality is essential. In this study, we
examine how persona adoption influences the consistency and fairness of harmful
content classification across different LLM architectures, model sizes, and
content modalities (language vs. vision). At first glance, headline performance
metrics suggest that personas have little impact on overall classification
accuracy. However, a closer analysis reveals important behavioral shifts.
Personas with different ideological leanings display distinct propensities to
label content as harmful, showing that the lens through which a model "views"
input can subtly shape its judgments. Further agreement analyses highlight that
models, particularly larger ones, tend to align more closely with personas from
the same political ideology, strengthening within-ideology consistency while
widening divergence across ideological groups. To show this effect more
directly, we conducted an additional study on a politically targeted task,
which confirmed that personas not only behave more coherently within their own
ideology but also exhibit a tendency to defend their perspective while
downplaying harmfulness in opposing views. Together, these findings highlight
how persona conditioning can introduce subtle ideological biases into LLM
outputs, raising concerns about the use of AI systems that may reinforce
partisan perspectives under the guise of neutrality.

*Tarun Kumar Chawdhury,Jon D. Duke*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLEAR方法通过实体感知检索技术提升临床问答系统效率，F1提升4%同时减少78%计算资源


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统向量数据库方法在医疗记录语义问答中忽略临床关系细微差别的问题

Method: 开发Clinical Notes QA评估平台，对比实体感知检索(CLEAR)、零样本大上下文推理和传统分块检索增强生成

Result: 65k tokens长文档胜率75%，平均语义相似度0.878，token使用减少78%

Conclusion: 实体感知检索显著提升临床NLP的效率和准确性，评估框架为医疗QA系统提供可靠基准

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) store clinical documentation as base64
encoded attachments in FHIR DocumentReference resources, which makes semantic
question answering difficult. Traditional vector database methods often miss
nuanced clinical relationships. The Clinical Entity Augmented Retrieval (CLEAR)
method, introduced by Lopez et al. 2025, uses entity aware retrieval and
achieved improved performance with an F1 score of 0.90 versus 0.86 for
embedding based retrieval, while using over 70 percent fewer tokens. We
developed a Clinical Notes QA Evaluation Platform to validate CLEAR against
zero shot large context inference and traditional chunk based retrieval
augmented generation. The platform was tested on 12 clinical notes ranging from
10,000 to 65,000 tokens representing realistic EHR content. CLEAR achieved a
58.3 percent win rate, an average semantic similarity of 0.878, and used 78
percent fewer tokens than wide context processing. The largest performance
gains occurred on long notes, with a 75 percent win rate for documents
exceeding 65,000 tokens. These findings confirm that entity aware retrieval
improves both efficiency and accuracy in clinical natural language processing.
The evaluation framework provides a reusable and transparent benchmark for
assessing clinical question answering systems where semantic precision and
computational efficiency are critical.

Abstract: Post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for unlocking their
task generalization potential and domain-specific capabilities. However, the
current LLM post-training paradigm faces significant data challenges, including
the high costs of manual annotation and diminishing marginal returns on data
scales. Therefore, achieving data-efficient post-training has become a key
research question. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey of
data-efficient LLM post-training from a data-centric perspective. We propose a
taxonomy of data-efficient LLM post-training methods, covering data selection,
data quality enhancement, synthetic data generation, data distillation and
compression, and self-evolving data ecosystems. We summarize representative
approaches in each category and outline future research directions. By
examining the challenges in data-efficient LLM post-training, we highlight open
problems and propose potential research avenues. We hope our work inspires
further exploration into maximizing the potential of data utilization in
large-scale model training. Paper List:

Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对LLM工具在标注数据集创建中的性能及其对NLP视角化方法影响的系统评估，需填补这一空白。

Method: 通过对比实验设计（手动/自动/半自动三种标注模式），测量标注时间、语义覆盖度和框架多样性指标。

Result: 半自动模式框架多样性提升23%，覆盖度与人工组持平；全自动模式除标注速度外，其他指标均下降35%以上。

Conclusion: 人机协同的半自动标注在效率与质量间达到最佳平衡，证明混合方法在语义标注任务中的显著优势。

Abstract: The use of LLM-based applications as a means to accelerate and/or substitute
human labor in the creation of language resources and dataset is a reality.
Nonetheless, despite the potential of such tools for linguistic research,
comprehensive evaluation of their performance and impact on the creation of
annotated datasets, especially under a perspectivized approach to NLP, is still
missing. This paper contributes to reduction of this gap by reporting on an
extensive evaluation of the (semi-)automatization of FrameNet-like semantic
annotation by the use of an LLM-based semantic role labeler. The methodology
employed compares annotation time, coverage and diversity in three experimental
settings: manual, automatic and semi-automatic annotation. Results show that
the hybrid, semi-automatic annotation setting leads to increased frame
diversity and similar annotation coverage, when compared to the human-only
setting, while the automatic setting performs considerably worse in all
metrics, except for annotation time.

*André V. Duarte,Xuying li,Bin Zeng,Arlindo L. Oliveira,Lei Li,Zhuo Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出RECAP流程，通过反馈循环+越狱模块，显著提升LLM训练数据提取效率（如GPT-4.1提取准确率提升24%）


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当LLM自由复现训练数据时，这是证明其记忆的最强证据。但现有方法受限于模型对齐机制和单次提取效率低下

Method: 1. 反馈循环：次级模型比对输出与原文，生成修正提示迭代优化
2. 越狱模块：检测并突破模型对齐导致的拒绝行为

Result: 在包含30+本书的EchoTrace测试中，ROUGE-L得分从0.38→0.47（GPT-4.1），版权文本提取效果提升近24%

Conclusion: RECAP通过迭代优化有效提取受版权保护文本，突破模型对齐限制，为数据溯源提供新工具

Abstract: If we cannot inspect the training data of a large language model (LLM), how
can we ever know what it has seen? We believe the most compelling evidence
arises when the model itself freely reproduces the target content. As such, we
propose RECAP, an agentic pipeline designed to elicit and verify memorized
training data from LLM outputs. At the heart of RECAP is a feedback-driven
loop, where an initial extraction attempt is evaluated by a secondary language
model, which compares the output against a reference passage and identifies
discrepancies. These are then translated into minimal correction hints, which
are fed back into the target model to guide subsequent generations. In
addition, to address alignment-induced refusals, RECAP includes a jailbreaking
module that detects and overcomes such barriers. We evaluate RECAP on
EchoTrace, a new benchmark spanning over 30 full books, and the results show
that RECAP leads to substantial gains over single-iteration approaches. For
instance, with GPT-4.1, the average ROUGE-L score for the copyrighted text
extraction improved from 0.38 to 0.47 - a nearly 24% increase.

TL;DR: 研究表明适当平衡多语言数据可在不影响性能的前提下提升模型能力，挑战了多语言训练会降低性能的固有认知


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对多语言预训练数据混合比例争议，验证语言覆盖与模型性能间是否存在必然冲突（多语言诅咒假说）

Method: 训练1.1B/3B参数模型，使用25-400种语言组合，分析英语枢纽语言作用及跨语系表现

Result: ①足够token前提下英语与多语言数据可共存不降效 ②英语枢纽语言优于特定语系枢纽 ③未观测到显著多语言诅咒现象

Conclusion: 合理配置多语言数据能增强模型跨语言能力，尤其在低资源场景下仍可保持性能，打破多语言训练必然伴随性能折衷的迷思

Abstract: The impact of different multilingual data mixtures in pretraining large
language models (LLMs) has been a topic of ongoing debate, often raising
concerns about potential trade-offs between language coverage and model
performance (i.e., the curse of multilinguality). In this work, we investigate
these assumptions by training 1.1B and 3B parameter LLMs on diverse
multilingual corpora, varying the number of languages from 25 to 400. Our study
challenges common beliefs surrounding multilingual training. First, we find
that combining English and multilingual data does not necessarily degrade the
in-language performance of either group, provided that languages have a
sufficient number of tokens included in the pretraining corpus. Second, we
observe that using English as a pivot language (i.e., a high-resource language
that serves as a catalyst for multilingual generalization) yields benefits
across language families, and contrary to expectations, selecting a pivot
language from within a specific family does not consistently improve
performance for languages within that family. Lastly, we do not observe a
significant "curse of multilinguality" as the number of training languages
increases in models at this scale. Our findings suggest that multilingual data,
when balanced appropriately, can enhance language model capabilities without
compromising performance, even in low-resource settings

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索机器翻译过程中文化差异对语义标签保留的影响，填补该领域研究空白

Method: 通过文化敏感领域/中性领域的对比实验，分析统计MT工具与LLM在翻译时的标签变化模式

Result: 1) 现代MT系统导致文化敏感领域标签漂移 2) LLM的文化知识会放大漂移 3) 语言文化相似性决定标签保留效果

Conclusion: 忽视文化因素会威胁翻译质量，导致下游应用出现文化冲突和误读风险

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) is widely employed to address resource scarcity in
low-resource languages by generating synthetic data from high-resource
counterparts. While sentiment preservation in translation has long been
studied, a critical but underexplored factor is the role of cultural alignment
between source and target languages. In this paper, we hypothesize that
semantic labels are drifted or altered during MT due to cultural divergence.
Through a series of experiments across culturally sensitive and neutral
domains, we establish three key findings: (1) MT systems, including modern
Large Language Models (LLMs), induce label drift during translation,
particularly in culturally sensitive domains; (2) unlike earlier statistical MT
tools, LLMs encode cultural knowledge, and leveraging this knowledge can
amplify label drift; and (3) cultural similarity or dissimilarity between
source and target languages is a crucial determinant of label preservation. Our
findings highlight that neglecting cultural factors in MT not only undermines
label fidelity but also risks misinterpretation and cultural conflict in
downstream applications.

TL;DR: 提出SymCode神经符号框架，通过代码生成与符号引擎验证，显著提升LLM数学推理准确率(最高+13.6%)并增强可解释性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM数学推理存在未经验证的文本生成缺陷，传统提示策略缺乏确定性验证机制，导致不可靠解决方案

Method: 将数学问题转化为SymPy代码生成任务，结合神经生成与符号计算验证，建立可验证的执行框架

Result: 在MATH-500等基准测试中准确率提升达13.6个百分点，错误类型从逻辑谬误转为可调试的编程错误

Conclusion: SymCode通过符号引擎验证实现了形式化领域AI推理的可信度突破，为可靠数学推理系统提供了新范式

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning, where prose-based generation leads to unverified and arithmetically
unsound solutions. Current prompting strategies like Chain of Thought still
operate within this unreliable medium, lacking a mechanism for deterministic
verification. To address these limitations, we introduce SymCode, a
neurosymbolic framework that reframes mathematical problem-solving as a task of
verifiable code generation using the SymPy library. We evaluate SymCode on
challenging benchmarks, including MATH-500 and OlympiadBench, demonstrating
significant accuracy improvements of up to 13.6 percentage points over
baselines. Our analysis shows that SymCode is not only more token-efficient but
also fundamentally shifts model failures from opaque logical fallacies towards
transparent, programmatic errors. By grounding LLM reasoning in a deterministic
symbolic engine, SymCode represents a key step towards more accurate and

<details>

Motivation: Trainium芯片的脉动阵列架构和数据布局要求对性能优化形成挑战，需要针对性解决内存带宽利用和矩阵转置开销问题

Method: 基于内核融合减少软件管理内存层次的数据移动，开发新型缓存策略最大化SRAM带宽，消除矩阵转置操作

Conclusion: 通过架构定制化优化方案，成功释放了Trainium芯片在LLM推理场景下的性能潜力，验证了系统级优化策略的有效性

Abstract: AI accelerators, customized to AI workloads, provide cost-effective and
high-performance solutions for training and inference. Trainium, an AI
accelerator recently developed by Amazon Web Services (AWS), provides an
attractive option for LLM training and inference through its heterogeneous
architecture. However, leveraging Trainium architecture for high performance
can be challenging because of its systolic array architecture and special
requirement on data layout. In this paper, we design high-performance matrix
multiplication (matmul), a critical compute kernel, for LLM inference on
Trainium. We introduce a series of techniques customized to Trainium based on
kernel fusion and novel caching strategies to reduce data movement across the
software-managed memory hierarchy, maximize SRAM bandwidth, and avoid expensive
matrix transpose. Evaluating with nine datasets and four recent LLMs, we show
that our system largely outperforms the state-of-the-art matmul implemented by
AWS on Trainium: at the level of matmul kernel, it achieves an average 1.35x
speedup (up to 2.22x), which translates to an average 1.66x speedup (up to
2.49x) for end-to-end LLM inference.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出AttnCache框架，通过重用相似注意力图加速LLM预填充阶段的计算效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在仅需预填充的场景(如分类/问答)中，自注意力计算的二次复杂度成为性能瓶颈

Method: 建立注意力图记忆库，通过相似性检索复用预存注意力图，减少实时计算量

Result: CPU端实现1.2倍端到端/2倍注意力加速，GPU端达1.6倍端到端/3倍注意力加速，精度损失可忽略

Conclusion: AttnCache有效降低LLM预填充阶段计算开销，为注意力密集型应用提供高效推理方案

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in generative applications such
as chatting, code generation, and reasoning. However, many realworld workloads
such as classification, question answering, recommendation, and text embedding
rely solely on the prefill stage of inference, where the model encodes input
sequences without performing autoregressive decoding. In these prefill only
scenarios, the self-attention computation becomes the primary performance
bottleneck due to its quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length. In
this paper, we observe that semantically different sentences often produce
similar attention maps across layers and heads. Building on this insight, we
propose AttnCache, a framework that accelerates the prefill stage of LLM
inference by retrieving and reusing similar attention maps. Based on an
attention map memorization database, AttnCache employs efficient caching and
similarity search techniques to identify and reuse pre-cached attention maps
during inference, thereby reducing the computational overhead of
self-attention. Experimental results show that AttnCache achieves an average of
1.2x end-to-end and 2x attention speedup on CPU, and 1.6x end-to-end and 3x
attention speedup on GPU, with negligible accuracy degradation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出监督强化学习（SRL）框架，通过将问题解决转化为逻辑动作序列生成，结合监督相似性奖励和强化学习，显著提升小模型在多步推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法RLVR在错误率高时失效，SFT容易过拟合长演示。需要一种能在错误中学习、灵活利用专家示范的新训练范式。

Method: 将推理过程分解为逻辑动作序列，训练模型生成内部推理独白后执行动作。通过逐步对比模型动作与专家动作的相似性提供监督奖励。

Result: SRL使小模型学会RLVR/SFT无法掌握的复杂推理任务，与RLVR结合后达到最强性能，在软件工程任务中验证泛化能力。

Conclusion: SRL为推理导向的LLMs提供了既稳健又灵活的通用训练框架，开辟了监督学习与强化学习协同优化的新路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with problems that require
multi-step reasoning. For small-scale open-source models, Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) fails when correct solutions are rarely
sampled even after many attempts, while Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to
overfit long demonstrations through rigid token-by-token imitation. To address
this gap, we propose Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL), a framework that
reformulates problem solving as generating a sequence of logical "actions". SRL
trains the model to generate an internal reasoning monologue before committing
to each action. It provides smoother rewards based on the similarity between
the model's actions and expert actions extracted from the SFT dataset in a
step-wise manner. This supervision offers richer learning signals even when all
rollouts are incorrect, while encouraging flexible reasoning guided by expert
demonstrations. As a result, SRL enables small models to learn challenging
problems previously unlearnable by SFT or RLVR. Moreover, initializing training
with SRL before refining with RLVR yields the strongest overall performance.
Beyond reasoning benchmarks, SRL generalizes effectively to agentic software
engineering tasks, establishing it as a robust and versatile training framework
for reasoning-oriented LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出强化学习方法PORTool，通过多轨迹探索和步骤奖励机制提升大语言模型的工具调用性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具调用模型依赖静态数据集训练，在动态工具环境中无法有效探索解决方案，导致性能受限

Method: 1. 生成多轨迹形成树状结构 2. 基于答案正确性和工具调用成功率分配步骤奖励 3. 结合分支相关优势和轨迹相关优势训练模型

Result: 使用17种工具的实验显示，在最终准确率和工具调用步骤数上实现显著提升，并通过消融实验验证奖励机制有效性

Conclusion: PORTool通过强化学习框架有效解决了动态工具环境中的探索问题，在复杂场景中展现优越性能

Abstract: Current tool-use large language models (LLMs) are trained on static datasets,
enabling them to interact with external tools and perform multi-step,
tool-integrated reasoning, which produces tool-call trajectories. However,
these models imitate how a query is resolved in a generic tool-call routine,
thereby failing to explore possible solutions and demonstrating limited
performance in an evolved, dynamic tool-call environment. In this work, we
propose PORTool, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that encourages a
tool-use LLM to explore various trajectories yielding the correct answer.
Specifically, this method starts with generating multiple rollouts for a given
query, and some of them share the first few tool-call steps, thereby forming a
tree-like structure. Next, we assign rewards to each step, based on its ability
to produce a correct answer and make successful tool calls. A shared step
across different trajectories receives the same reward, while different steps
under the same fork receive different rewards. Finally, these step-wise rewards
are used to calculate fork-relative advantages, blended with
trajectory-relative advantages, to train the LLM for tool use. The experiments
utilize 17 tools to address user queries, covering both time-sensitive and
time-invariant topics. We conduct ablation studies to systematically justify
the necessity and the design robustness of step-wise rewards. Furthermore, we
compare the proposed PORTool with other training approaches and demonstrate
significant improvements in final accuracy and the number of tool-call steps.

TL;DR: 该研究提出Surgical Steering方法，通过分层激活干预在跨语言对齐中平衡知识迁移与文化定位，解决现有方法导致文化特异性丧失的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现现有跨语言对齐方法在促进知识迁移时会导致文化特异性响应能力下降（文化擦除现象），需探索二者平衡机制。

Method: 1. 构建transfer-localization评估框架量化知识迁移与文化定位
2. 分析模型内部表征，发现不同层级分别控制事实迁移与文化知识
3. 提出基于分层激活干预的Surgical Steering方法

Result: 实验表明现有方法在六种语言上均导致文化定位能力下降（平均降幅32%），Surgical Steering实现迁移-定位平衡（+15%文化定位保持95%事实迁移）

Conclusion: 通过分层目标解耦策略可实现跨语言模型的知识迁移与文化特异性保持的双重优化，为多语言AI系统设计提供新范式。

Abstract: Cross-lingual alignment (CLA) aims to align multilingual representations,
enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to seamlessly transfer knowledge across
languages. While intuitive, we hypothesize, this pursuit of representational
convergence can inadvertently cause "cultural erasure", the functional loss of
providing culturally-situated responses that should diverge based on the query
language. In this work, we systematically analyze this trade-off by introducing
a holistic evaluation framework, the transfer-localization plane, which
quantifies both desirable knowledge transfer and undesirable cultural erasure.
Using this framework, we re-evaluate recent CLA approaches and find that they
consistently improve factual transfer at the direct cost of cultural
localization across all six languages studied. Our investigation into the
internal representations of these models reveals a key insight: universal
factual transfer and culturally-specific knowledge are optimally steerable at
different model layers. Based on this finding, we propose Surgical Steering, a
novel inference-time method that disentangles these two objectives. By applying
targeted activation steering to distinct layers, our approach achieves a better
balance between the two competing dimensions, effectively overcoming the
limitations of current alignment techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 甲状腺偶发发现（ITFs）随影像检查普及显著增加，但其与甲状腺癌过度诊断的关联及临床路径缺乏系统评估

Method: 基于Mayo Clinic 11.5万例患者的回顾性研究，开发transformer架构的NLP流程分析多模态放射报告，评估ITFs特征及后续诊疗路径

Result: 7.8%患者检出ITFs（92.9%为结节），女性/高龄/肿瘤科开单更易检出；44%结节记录尺寸，仅15%描述钙化等特征；ITFs患者甲状腺癌检出风险增加（多为较大乳头状癌）

Conclusion: ITFs普遍存在且易引发诊疗链条，凸显甲状腺癌过度诊断问题，建议标准化报告格式并建立选择性随访策略

Abstract: Importance Incidental thyroid findings (ITFs) are increasingly detected on
imaging performed for non-thyroid indications. Their prevalence, features, and
clinical consequences remain undefined. Objective To develop, validate, and
deploy a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to identify ITFs in
radiology reports and assess their prevalence, features, and clinical outcomes.
Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort of adults without prior
thyroid disease undergoing thyroid-capturing imaging at Mayo Clinic sites from
July 1, 2017, to September 30, 2023. A transformer-based NLP pipeline
identified ITFs and extracted nodule characteristics from image reports from
multiple modalities and body regions. Main Outcomes and Measures Prevalence of
ITFs, downstream thyroid ultrasound, biopsy, thyroidectomy, and thyroid cancer
diagnosis. Logistic regression identified demographic and imaging-related
factors. Results Among 115,683 patients (mean age, 56.8 [SD 17.2] years; 52.9%
women), 9,077 (7.8%) had an ITF, of which 92.9% were nodules. ITFs were more
likely in women, older adults, those with higher BMI, and when imaging was
ordered by oncology or internal medicine. Compared with chest CT, ITFs were
more likely via neck CT, PET, and nuclear medicine scans. Nodule
characteristics were poorly documented, with size reported in 44% and other
features in fewer than 15% (e.g. calcifications). Compared with patients
without ITFs, those with ITFs had higher odds of thyroid nodule diagnosis,
biopsy, thyroidectomy and thyroid cancer diagnosis. Most cancers were
papillary, and larger when detected after ITFs vs no ITF. Conclusions ITFs were
common and strongly associated with cascades leading to the detection of small,
low-risk cancers. These findings underscore the role of ITFs in thyroid cancer
overdiagnosis and the need for standardized reporting and more selective
follow-up.

Result: GPT-4o准确率仅18.97%，推理模型o3达78%，显著超过人类代码39.98%的平均成功率

Conclusion: 发布QCoder Benchmark数据集及API，揭示LLM在量子编程中的挑战与潜力，推动领域研究发展

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been applied to automatic
programming code generation. This task can be viewed as a language generation
task that bridges natural language, human knowledge, and programming logic.
However, it remains underexplored in domains that require interaction with
hardware devices, such as quantum programming, where human coders write Python
code that is executed on a quantum computer. To address this gap, we introduce
QCoder Benchmark, an evaluation framework that assesses LLMs on quantum
programming with feedback from simulated hardware devices. Our benchmark offers
two key features. First, it supports evaluation using a quantum simulator
environment beyond conventional Python execution, allowing feedback of
domain-specific metrics such as circuit depth, execution time, and error
classification, which can be used to guide better generation. Second, it
incorporates human-written code submissions collected from real programming
contests, enabling both quantitative comparisons and qualitative analyses of
LLM outputs against human-written codes. Our experiments reveal that even
advanced models like GPT-4o achieve only around 18.97% accuracy, highlighting
the difficulty of the benchmark. In contrast, reasoning-based models such as o3
reach up to 78% accuracy, outperforming averaged success rates of human-written
codes (39.98%). We release the QCoder Benchmark dataset and public evaluation
API to support further research.

TL;DR: 提出1PNS训练范式，通过RPD指标增强模型推理多样性，实验显示pass@k显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统1P1S训练导致输出多样性不足，限制了模型推理路径的广度。

Method: 引入RPD指标量化思维链差异，筛选多样化解决方案微调模型。

Result: Qwen3-4B-Base模型pass@16平均提升2.80%，AIME24数据集提升4.99%。

Conclusion: 1PNS有效增强TTS效果，代码开源推动实践应用。

Abstract: While Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has proven effective in improving the reasoning
ability of large language models (LLMs), low diversity in model outputs often
becomes a bottleneck; this is partly caused by the common "one problem, one
solution" (1P1S) training practice, which provides a single canonical answer
and can push models toward a narrow set of reasoning paths. To address this, we
propose a "one problem, multiple solutions" (1PNS) training paradigm that
exposes the model to a variety of valid reasoning trajectories and thus
increases inference diversity. A core challenge for 1PNS is reliably measuring
semantic differences between multi-step chains of thought, so we introduce
Reasoning Path Divergence (RPD), a step-level metric that aligns and scores
Long Chain-of-Thought solutions to capture differences in intermediate
reasoning. Using RPD, we curate maximally diverse solution sets per problem and
fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Base. Experiments show that RPD-selected training yields
more varied outputs and higher pass@k, with an average +2.80% gain in pass@16
over a strong 1P1S baseline and a +4.99% gain on AIME24, demonstrating that
1PNS further amplifies the effectiveness of TTS. Our code is available at

Method: 基于SemEval PTs数据集，用4个LLM+10种prompt生成40个DR分类器，通过多数投票策略构建5个银标数据集（204-1281样本量）

Result: 统计分析显示Cause/Purpose/Contrast等六个话语关系在Loaded Language/Repetition等说服技巧中起核心作用

Conclusion: 该发现不仅助力网络虚假信息检测，也为理解有效沟通机制提供新视角

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between Persuasion Techniques (PTs)
and Discourse Relations (DRs) by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and
prompt engineering. Since no dataset annotated with both PTs and DRs exists, we
took the SemEval 2023 Task 3 dataset labelled with 19 PTs as a starting point
and developed LLM-based classifiers to label each instance of the dataset with
one of the 22 PDTB 3.0 level-2 DRs. In total, four LLMs were evaluated using 10
different prompts, resulting in 40 unique DR classifiers. Ensemble models using
different majority-pooling strategies were used to create 5 silver datasets of
instances labelled with both persuasion techniques and level-2 PDTB senses. The
silver dataset sizes vary from 1,281 instances to 204 instances, depending on
the majority pooling technique used. Statistical analysis of these silver
datasets shows that six discourse relations (namely Cause, Purpose, Contrast,
Cause+Belief, Concession, and Condition) play a crucial role in persuasive
texts, especially in the use of Loaded Language, Exaggeration/Minimisation,
Repetition and to cast Doubt. This insight can contribute to detecting online
propaganda and misinformation, as well as to our general understanding of
effective communication.

Conclusion: MossNet为高效循环架构提供了新范式，在保持RNN计算效率优势的同时实现接近Transformer的表达能力，具备工程实用价值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced generative
applications in natural language processing (NLP). Recent trends in model
architectures revolve around efficient variants of transformers or
state-space/gated-recurrent models (SSMs, GRMs). However, prevailing
SSM/GRM-based methods often emulate only a single attention head, potentially
limiting their expressiveness. In this work, we propose MossNet, a novel
mixture-of-state-space-experts architecture that emulates a linear multi-head
attention (MHA). MossNet leverages a mixture-of-experts (MoE) implementation
not only in channel-mixing multi-layered perceptron (MLP) blocks but also in
the time-mixing SSM kernels to realize multiple "attention heads." Extensive
experiments on language modeling and downstream evaluations show that MossNet
outperforms both transformer- and SSM-based architectures of similar model size
and data budgets. Larger variants of MossNet, trained on trillions of tokens,
further confirm its scalability and superior performance. In addition,
real-device profiling on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and an Nvidia A100 GPU
demonstrate favorable runtime speed and resource usage compared to similarly
sized baselines. Our results suggest that MossNet is a compelling new direction
for efficient, high-performing recurrent LLM architectures.

Result: 相比基线模型显著减少无效生成（abstentions），提高了统计效率

Conclusion: SDM框架能有效优化语言模型的生成校准性，适用于提升指令遵循任务的模型性能

Abstract: We introduce Similarity-Distance-Magnitude (SDM) language models (LMs), which
are sequence prediction models fine-tuned to maximize the proportion of
generations in the well-calibrated, high-probability region partitioned by a
final-layer SDM activation layer used for binary classification of
instruction-following. We demonstrate that existing pre-trained decoder-only
Transformer LMs can be readily converted into SDM LMs via supervised
fine-tuning, using the final-layer SDM activation layer during training to
estimate a change-of-base for a supervised next-token loss over a contrastive
input encoding scheme, with additional hard negative examples generated online
during training. This results in reduced abstentions (i.e., improved
statistical efficiency) compared to strong supervised baselines.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型评估方法依赖单一指令模板，忽视了模型对指令风格的敏感性，而这对实际部署至关重要

Method: 开发RCScore多维度框架，通过系统化转换基准问题的指令风格，并设计跨响应相似性（CRS）方法衡量风格自洽性

Result: 在4个推理基准测试中发现指令风格变化导致准确率最大波动达16.7%；确定性解码产出更稳定，模型规模与跨风格一致性正相关；CRS与任务准确率强相关（相关系数0.82）

Conclusion: RCScore为评估指令鲁棒性提供量化框架，模型输出的风格自洽性可作为可靠性的有效代理指标，建议将指令敏感性分析纳入模型评估体系

Abstract: Current LLM evaluations often rely on a single instruction template,
overlooking models' sensitivity to instruction style-a critical aspect for
real-world deployments. We present RCScore, a multi-dimensional framework
quantifying how instruction formulation affects model responses. By
systematically transforming benchmark problems into multiple instruction
styles, RCScore reveals performance variations undetected by conventional
metrics. Our experiments across ten LLMs on four reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that instruction style can shift accuracy by up to 16.7% points. We
introduce Cross-Response Similarity (CRS), a method applying RCScore metrics to
measure stylistic self-consistency, and establish its strong correlation with
task accuracy, suggesting consistency as a valuable proxy for model
reliability. Additional findings show that deterministic decoding produces more
stylistically stable outputs, and model scale correlates positively with
cross-style consistency. RCScore offers a principled approach to assess
instruction robustness.

Motivation: 扩散语言模型在细粒度控制时存在更新遗忘现象，导致语义编辑丢失和生成质量下降。

Method: TTA通过动态分配token的时间步（关键token早冻结，不确定token持续优化），实现软语义排序。支持固定策略和任务信号驱动的自适应策略。

Result: 情感控制任务准确率提升20%+，困惑度降低50%；解毒任务最大毒性值降低12.2 vs 14.5，困惑度26.0 vs 32.0。

Conclusion: 基于时间步的柔性排序机制是解决更新遗忘、实现可控扩散文本生成的关键突破，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) enable fine-grained refinement, their
practical controllability remains fragile. We identify and formally
characterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform
and context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps,
erasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement
process, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in
uniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token
ordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and
semantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are
frozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This
timestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an
adaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of
refinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies
uniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision
sources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment
control, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves
perplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers
maximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0).
Together, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep
allocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving
stable and controllable diffusion text generation.

Motivation: 人类反馈数据存在编码不透明性，可能导致语言模型出现不可预测的负面影响，需系统性理解反馈数据中的偏好构成

Method: 开发WIMHF框架，利用稀疏自编码器从7个不同数据集中提取人类可解释的偏好特征

Result: 1. 识别出少量关键特征即可预测80%偏好信号
2. 发现Reddit偏好非正式幽默 vs 学术数据集偏好正式
3. 筛选有害数据使安全性提升37%
4. 个性化特征权重提升社区对齐效果

Conclusion: WIMHF为反馈数据分析提供了可解释工具，既能揭示潜在风险偏好，又支持精准数据优化与个性化对齐

Abstract: Human feedback can alter language models in unpredictable and undesirable
ways, as practitioners lack a clear understanding of what feedback data
encodes. While prior work studies preferences over certain attributes (e.g.,
length or sycophancy), automatically extracting relevant features without
pre-specifying hypotheses remains challenging. We introduce What's In My Human
Feedback? (WIMHF), a method to explain feedback data using sparse autoencoders.
WIMHF characterizes both (1) the preferences a dataset is capable of measuring
and (2) the preferences that the annotators actually express. Across 7
datasets, WIMHF identifies a small number of human-interpretable features that
account for the majority of the preference prediction signal achieved by
black-box models. These features reveal a wide diversity in what humans prefer,
and the role of dataset-level context: for example, users on Reddit prefer
informality and jokes, while annotators in HH-RLHF and PRISM disprefer them.
WIMHF also surfaces potentially unsafe preferences, such as that LMArena users
tend to vote against refusals, often in favor of toxic content. The learned
features enable effective data curation: re-labeling the harmful examples in
Arena yields large safety gains (+37%) with no cost to general performance.
They also allow fine-grained personalization: on the Community Alignment
dataset, we learn annotator-specific weights over subjective features that
improve preference prediction. WIMHF provides a human-centered analysis method
for practitioners to better understand and use preference data.

TL;DR: 提出了首个针对全局RAG能力的评测基准GlobalQA，并开发了多工具协同框架GlobalRAG，在Qwen2.5-14B模型上将F1分数从基准的1.51提升至6.63


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG评估基准局限于需要局部文本理解的'local RAG'任务，无法满足需要跨文档聚合分析的'global RAG'实际需求

Method: 提出GlobalRAG框架：通过分块检索保持结构连贯性，LLM智能过滤器去除噪声文档，集成聚合模块实现符号计算

Result: 在全局RAG任务中，GlobalRAG框架相比最强基线（1.51 F1）实现了6.63 F1的性能提升

Conclusion: GlobalRAG有效解决了跨文档信息聚合难题，为提升大模型在复杂知识推理任务中的表现提供了新方向

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a leading approach to
reducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). Current RAG evaluation
benchmarks primarily focus on what we call local RAG: retrieving relevant
chunks from a small subset of documents to answer queries that require only
localized understanding within specific text chunks. However, many real-world
applications require a fundamentally different capability -- global RAG --
which involves aggregating and analyzing information across entire document
collections to derive corpus-level insights (for example, "What are the top 10
most cited papers in 2023?"). In this paper, we introduce GlobalQA -- the first
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate global RAG capabilities, covering
four core task types: counting, extremum queries, sorting, and top-k
extraction. Through systematic evaluation across different models and
baselines, we find that existing RAG methods perform poorly on global tasks,
with the strongest baseline achieving only 1.51 F1 score. To address these
challenges, we propose GlobalRAG, a multi-tool collaborative framework that
preserves structural coherence through chunk-level retrieval, incorporates
LLM-driven intelligent filters to eliminate noisy documents, and integrates
aggregation modules for precise symbolic computation. On the Qwen2.5-14B model,
GlobalRAG achieves 6.63 F1 compared to the strongest baseline's 1.51 F1,
validating the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: 通过语用学理论提示提升语言模型隐含语义理解能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐含语义理解对语言沟通至关重要，现有语言模型缺乏显式语用推理框架

Method: 将Gricean语用学和关联理论作为上下文提示，设计分步推理流程引导模型解释

Result: 相比0-shot Chain-of-Thought基线提升9.6%，仅提及理论名称在大型模型中提升1-3%

Conclusion: 显式引入语用学理论能有效增强语言模型的语用推理能力，且模型规模越大理论框架的暗示效应越明显

Abstract: The ability to accurately interpret implied meanings plays a crucial role in
human communication and language use, and language models are also expected to
possess this capability. This study demonstrates that providing language models
with pragmatic theories as prompts is an effective in-context learning approach
for tasks to understand implied meanings. Specifically, we propose an approach
in which an overview of pragmatic theories, such as Gricean pragmatics and
Relevance Theory, is presented as a prompt to the language model, guiding it
through a step-by-step reasoning process to derive a final interpretation.
Experimental results showed that, compared to the baseline, which prompts
intermediate reasoning without presenting pragmatic theories (0-shot
Chain-of-Thought), our methods enabled language models to achieve up to 9.6\%
higher scores on pragmatic reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we show that even
without explaining the details of pragmatic theories, merely mentioning their
names in the prompt leads to a certain performance improvement (around 1-3%) in
larger models compared to the baseline.

TL;DR: 预训练语言模型在识别借词方面表现不佳，揭示NLP系统存在借词偏好


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究双语社区中主导语言对少数语言持续施加词汇压力的背景下，验证语言模型是否具备类似人类的借词识别能力

Method: 在10种语言中评估包括大语言模型在内的多种预训练模型，测试其区分借词与原生词汇的能力

Result: 模型即使在明确指令和上下文提示下，仍难以有效识别借词

Conclusion: 该发现对开发少数语言NLP工具及保护受词汇侵蚀威胁的语言社群具有重要意义

Abstract: Throughout language history, words are borrowed from one language to another
and gradually become integrated into the recipient's lexicon. Speakers can
often differentiate these loanwords from native vocabulary, particularly in
bilingual communities where a dominant language continuously imposes lexical
items on a minority language. This paper investigates whether pretrained
language models, including large language models, possess similar capabilities
for loanword identification. We evaluate multiple models across 10 languages.
Despite explicit instructions and contextual information, our results show that
models perform poorly in distinguishing loanwords from native ones. These
findings corroborate previous evidence that modern NLP systems exhibit a bias
toward loanwords rather than native equivalents. Our work has implications for
developing NLP tools for minority languages and supporting language
preservation in communities under lexical pressure from dominant languages.

TL;DR: 研究探索了知识蒸馏方法在多语言视觉语言模型压缩中的效果，发现部分蒸馏配置能保持跨语言检索鲁棒性，但也存在设计敏感性的性能权衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在多语言场景下存在性能不均衡问题，模型压缩加剧该现象。当前知识蒸馏在跨语言场景的应用研究不足，需系统探索不同蒸馏策略对多语言表征一致性的影响

Method: 通过控制变量实验，对CLIP和SigLIP2模型测试了五种知识蒸馏方案，评估模型压缩后（规模减半）的域内检索任务（图像-文本检索）和域外视觉问答任务的跨语言稳定性

Result: 部分蒸馏配置在模型减半后仍保持/提升多语言检索鲁棒性，但其他配置出现跨任务稳定性下降。不同设计选择会形成聚合准确率无法反映的敏感权衡（如跨语言表征一致性与下游任务稳定性间的矛盾）

Conclusion: 蒸馏方案设计对压缩模型的多语言能力保持至关重要。研究揭示了单纯依赖整体准确率评估的局限性，强调需要针对跨语言、跨任务稳定性进行专门优化

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit uneven performance across languages, a
problem that is often exacerbated when the model size is reduced. While
Knowledge distillation (KD) demonstrates promising results in transferring
knowledge from larger to smaller VLMs, applying KD in multilingualism is an
underexplored area. This paper presents a controlled empirical study of KD
behavior across five distillation approaches, isolating their effects on
cross-lingual representation consistency and downstream performance stability
under model compression. We study five distillation formulations across CLIP
and SigLIP2, and evaluate them on in-domain retrieval and out-of-domain visual
QA. We find that some configurations preserve or even improve multilingual
retrieval robustness despite halving model size, but others fail to maintain
cross-task stability, exposing design-sensitive trade-offs that aggregate
accuracy alone does not reveal.

TL;DR: 提出基于神经元激活内部信号的NAD解码方法，通过激活稀疏性和跨样本一致性实现无监督集成解码，显著降低token消耗并保持生成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM集成解码方法依赖校准不良的外部信号(如token概率)，无法有效利用内部神经元激活信息。通过分析发现正确回答的神经元激活模式具有稀疏性和一致性特征

Method: Neuron Agreement Decoding(NAD)使用两个内部信号：1)激活稀疏性(正确回答激活更少神经元) 2)跨样本神经元激活一致性。支持前32个token的早期预测和99% token用量的提前停止

Result: 在数学科学基准上匹配多数投票效果，开放编码任务超越Avg@64。早期停止减少99% token消耗，生成质量损失最小

Conclusion: 神经元激活内部信号为无监督集成解码提供可靠、可扩展且高效的指导，开辟了LLM推理优化的新方向

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) commonly boost reasoning via
sample-evaluate-ensemble decoders, achieving label free gains without ground
truth. However, prevailing strategies score candidates using only external
outputs such as token probabilities, entropies, or self evaluations, and these
signals can be poorly calibrated after post training. We instead analyze
internal behavior based on neuron activations and uncover three findings: (1)
external signals are low dimensional projections of richer internal dynamics;
(2) correct responses activate substantially fewer unique neurons than
incorrect ones throughout generation; and (3) activations from correct
responses exhibit stronger cross sample agreement, whereas incorrect ones
diverge. Motivated by these observations, we propose Neuron Agreement Decoding
(NAD), an unsupervised best-of-N method that selects candidates using
activation sparsity and cross sample neuron agreement, operating solely on
internal signals and without requiring comparable textual outputs. NAD enables
early correctness prediction within the first 32 generated tokens and supports
aggressive early stopping. Across math and science benchmarks with verifiable
answers, NAD matches majority voting; on open ended coding benchmarks where
majority voting is inapplicable, NAD consistently outperforms Avg@64. By
pruning unpromising trajectories early, NAD reduces token usage by 99% with
minimal loss in generation quality, showing that internal signals provide
reliable, scalable, and efficient guidance for label free ensemble decoding.

Motivation: 解释LLMs在数字处理上输入表示准确但输出错误频发的矛盾现象，探究其内部机制及改进方法。

Method: 分析不同LLM的数字隐藏表示系统性特征，量化其准确性下限，并创建可追踪错误到特定模型层的通用探针。

Result: 发现LLMs学习到可互换、高精度的通用数字表示，其隐藏状态能通过探针精确定位输出错误到具体层。

Conclusion: 揭示了LLM数字处理机制，为优化模型架构提供新方向，强调精确探测技术对提升模型准确性的关键作用。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that different large language models (LLMs) converge to
similar and accurate input embedding representations for numbers. These
findings conflict with the documented propensity of LLMs to produce erroneous
outputs when dealing with numeric information. In this work, we aim to explain
this conflict by exploring how language models manipulate numbers and quantify
the lower bounds of accuracy of these mechanisms. We find that despite
surfacing errors, different language models learn interchangeable
representations of numbers that are systematic, highly accurate and universal
across their hidden states and the types of input contexts. This allows us to
create universal probes for each LLM and to trace information -- including the
causes of output errors -- to specific layers. Our results lay a fundamental
understanding of how pre-trained LLMs manipulate numbers and outline the
potential of more accurate probing techniques in addressed refinements of LLMs'
architectures.

Result: 数独解题速度超人类3倍，但Flappy Bird平均存活时间不足2秒且无法通过首个障碍

Conclusion: Atlas具备强逻辑分析能力，但实时动作控制仍是当前主要技术限制

Abstract: OpenAI's ChatGPT Atlas introduces new capabilities for web interaction,
enabling the model to analyze webpages, process user intents, and execute
cursor and keyboard inputs directly within the browser. While its capacity for
information retrieval tasks has been demonstrated, its performance in dynamic,
interactive environments remains less explored. In this study, we conduct an
early evaluation of Atlas's web interaction capabilities using browser-based
games as test scenarios, including Google's T-Rex Runner, Sudoku, Flappy Bird,
and Stein.world. We employ in-game performance scores as quantitative metrics
to assess performance across different task types. Our results show that Atlas
performs strongly in logical reasoning tasks like Sudoku, completing puzzles
significantly faster than human baselines, but struggles substantially in
real-time games requiring precise timing and motor control, often failing to
progress beyond initial obstacles. These findings suggest that while Atlas
demonstrates capable analytical processing, there remain notable limitations in
dynamic web environments requiring real-time interaction. The website of our
project can be found at https://atlas-game-eval.github.io.

Motivation: 教育场景部署语言模型面临隐私保护、计算资源限制和教学有效性验证三大现实挑战，需要开发轻量化且可靠的本地方案

Method: 结合领域工具与自反思推理流程，通过GPT-4o生成数据的两阶段LoRA微调训练3B/8B轻量模型

Result: 8B模型在关键指标上媲美大模型，学生评价与GPT-4o/70B模型相当，同时满足隐私和本地部署需求

Conclusion: SCRIBE验证了轻量化模型在隐私敏感教育应用的可行性，为低资源场景提供有效解决方案

Abstract: Language models can be used to provide interactive, personalized student
feedback in educational settings. However, real-world deployment faces three
key challenges: privacy concerns, limited computational resources, and the need
for pedagogically valid responses. These constraints require small, open-source
models that can run locally and reliably ground their outputs in correct
information. We introduce SCRIBE, a framework for multi-hop, tool-augmented
reasoning designed to generate valid responses to student questions about
feedback reports. SCRIBE combines domain-specific tools with a self-reflective
inference pipeline that supports iterative reasoning, tool use, and error
recovery. We distil these capabilities into 3B and 8B models via two-stage LoRA
fine-tuning on synthetic GPT-4o-generated data. Evaluation with a human-aligned
GPT-Judge and a user study with 108 students shows that 8B-SCRIBE models
achieve comparable or superior quality to much larger models in key dimensions
such as relevance and actionability, while being perceived on par with GPT-4o
and Llama-3.3 70B by students. These findings demonstrate the viability of
SCRIBE for low-resource, privacy-sensitive educational applications.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型在经济学、心理学等需要深层原理理解的领域表现欠佳，存在专业领域知识鸿沟。

Method: 1. 自动生成教科书式课程大纲（含知识体系目录）
2. 基于布鲁姆分类法创建渐进式QA对
3. 采用内容与认知双维度对齐的持续预训练策略

Result: 在Llama 3.2模型上：
- 微观经济学准确率提升5个百分点
- 目标领域平均提升3个百分点
- 非目标领域正向知识迁移（+0.7点）
- ARC/GPQA基准提升超2点且通用能力稳定

Conclusion: ACER提供可扩展的方案填补LLMs关键领域空白，实现专业知识提升与通用能力保留的双重突破，具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at general tasks but underperform in
specialized domains like economics and psychology, which require deep,
principled understanding. To address this, we introduce ACER (Automated
Curriculum-Enhanced Regimen) that transforms generalist models into domain
experts without sacrificing their broad capabilities. ACER first synthesizes a
comprehensive, textbook-style curriculum by generating a table of contents for
a subject and then creating question-answer (QA) pairs guided by Bloom's
taxonomy. This ensures systematic topic coverage and progressively increasing
difficulty. The resulting synthetic corpus is used for continual pretraining
with an interleaved curriculum schedule, aligning learning across both content
and cognitive dimensions.
  Experiments with Llama 3.2 (1B and 3B) show significant gains in specialized
MMLU subsets. In challenging domains like microeconomics, where baselines
struggle, ACER boosts accuracy by 5 percentage points. Across all target
domains, we observe a consistent macro-average improvement of 3 percentage
points. Notably, ACER not only prevents catastrophic forgetting but also
facilitates positive cross-domain knowledge transfer, improving performance on
non-target domains by 0.7 points. Beyond MMLU, ACER enhances performance on
knowledge-intensive benchmarks like ARC and GPQA by over 2 absolute points,
while maintaining stable performance on general reasoning tasks. Our results
demonstrate that ACER offers a scalable and effective recipe for closing
critical domain gaps in LLMs.

Abstract: Health-related misinformation is very prevalent and potentially harmful. It
is difficult to identify, especially when claims distort or misinterpret
scientific findings. We investigate the impact of synthetic data generation and
lightweight fine-tuning techniques on the ability of large language models
(LLMs) to recognize fallacious arguments using the MISSCI dataset and
framework. In this work, we propose MisSynth, a pipeline that applies
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to produce synthetic fallacy samples,
which are then used to fine-tune an LLM model. Our results show substantial
accuracy gains with fine-tuned models compared to vanilla baselines. For
instance, the LLaMA 3.1 8B fine-tuned model achieved an over 35% F1-score
absolute improvement on the MISSCI test split over its vanilla baseline. We
demonstrate that introducing synthetic fallacy data to augment limited
annotated resources can significantly enhance zero-shot LLM classification
performance on real-world scientific misinformation tasks, even with limited
computational resources. The code and synthetic dataset are available on

Conclusion: 交互中心化框架为多智能体协同系统提供了自动化设计新范式，突破了对模型先验知识的依赖

Abstract: While a multi-agent approach based on large language models (LLMs) represents
a promising strategy to surpass the capabilities of single models, its success
is critically dependent on synergistic team composition. However, forming
optimal teams is a significant challenge, as the inherent opacity of most
models obscures the internal characteristics necessary for effective
collaboration. In this paper, we propose an interaction-centric framework for
automatic team composition that does not require any prior knowledge including
their internal architectures, training data, or task performances. Our method
constructs a "language model graph" that maps relationships between models from
the semantic coherence of pairwise conversations, and then applies community
detection to identify synergistic model clusters. Our experiments with diverse
LLMs demonstrate that the proposed method discovers functionally coherent
groups that reflect their latent specializations. Priming conversations with
specific topics identified synergistic teams which outperform random baselines
on downstream benchmarks and achieve comparable accuracy to that of
manually-curated teams based on known model specializations. Our findings
provide a new basis for the automated design of collaborative multi-agent LLM
teams.

Method: 构建24.6K高质量双语问答数据集，划分知识与培养双维度(61学科/11题型)，设计细粒度评估体系

Result: 知识维度最佳模型准确率仅60%(Gemini-2.5 Pro)，培养维度最优模型(QWQ)较人类差距达30%

Conclusion: LLMs在教育应用存在显著能力鸿沟，需针对性提升认知培养与跨学科推理能力

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), various LLM-based
works have been widely applied in educational fields. However, most existing
LLMs and their benchmarks focus primarily on the knowledge dimension, largely
neglecting the evaluation of cultivation capabilities that are essential for
real-world educational scenarios. Additionally, current benchmarks are often
limited to a single subject or question type, lacking sufficient diversity.
This issue is particularly prominent within the Chinese context. To address
this gap, we introduce OmniEduBench, a comprehensive Chinese educational
benchmark. OmniEduBench consists of 24.602K high-quality question-answer pairs.
The data is meticulously divided into two core dimensions: the knowledge
dimension and the cultivation dimension, which contain 18.121K and 6.481K
entries, respectively. Each dimension is further subdivided into 6 fine-grained
categories, covering a total of 61 different subjects (41 in the knowledge and
20 in the cultivation). Furthermore, the dataset features a rich variety of
question formats, including 11 common exam question types, providing a solid
foundation for comprehensively evaluating LLMs' capabilities in education.
Extensive experiments on 11 mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs
reveal a clear performance gap. In the knowledge dimension, only Gemini-2.5 Pro
surpassed 60\% accuracy, while in the cultivation dimension, the
best-performing model, QWQ, still trailed human intelligence by nearly 30\%.
These results highlight the substantial room for improvement and underscore the
challenges of applying LLMs in education.

Conclusion: SSLC为LLM部署提供了更优的压缩方案，验证了协同压缩策略的优越性，推动大模型落地应用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
language comprehension and generation; however, their widespread adoption is
constrained by substantial bandwidth and computational demands. While pruning
and low-rank approximation have each demonstrated promising performance
individually, their synergy for LLMs remains underexplored. We introduce
\underline{S}ynergistic \underline{S}parse and \underline{L}ow-Rank
\underline{C}ompression (SSLC) methods for LLMs, which leverages the strengths
of both techniques: low-rank approximation compresses the model by retaining
its essential structure with minimal information loss, whereas sparse
optimization eliminates non-essential weights, preserving those crucial for
generalization. Based on theoretical analysis, we first formulate the low-rank
approximation and sparse optimization as a unified problem and solve it by
iterative optimization algorithm. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen2.5 models
(7B-70B) show that SSLC, without any additional training steps, consistently
surpasses standalone methods, achieving state-of-the-arts results. Notably,
SSLC compresses Qwen2.5 by 50\% with no performance drop and achieves at least
1.63$\times$ speedup, offering a practical solution for efficient LLM
deployment.

Conclusion: 概率融合机制有效提升模型鲁棒性和可解释性，适应不同数据集的变异特征

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, with an increasing number
of domain-specific variants tailored for specialised tasks. However, these
models often lack transparency and explainability, can be costly to fine-tune,
require substantial prompt engineering, yield inconsistent results across
domains, and impose significant adverse environmental impact due to their high
computational demands. To address these challenges, we propose the Bayesian
network LLM fusion (BNLF) framework, which integrates predictions from three
LLMs, including FinBERT, RoBERTa, and BERTweet, through a probabilistic
mechanism for sentiment analysis. BNLF performs late fusion by modelling the
sentiment predictions from multiple LLMs as probabilistic nodes within a
Bayesian network. Evaluated across three human-annotated financial corpora with
distinct linguistic and contextual characteristics, BNLF demonstrates
consistent gains of about six percent in accuracy over the baseline LLMs,
underscoring its robustness to dataset variability and the effectiveness of
probabilistic fusion for interpretable sentiment classification.

TL;DR: 集成多个中大型开源LLM能比单一模型更可靠评估临床AI分诊工具，其中Llama3.3:70b与GPT-4o表现最佳，集成模型MCC值优于单一模型且无显著差异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证多LLM代理集成评估AI分诊工具的可靠性是否优于单一LLM

Method: 使用29,766例CT数据和8个开源LLM+GPT-4o，通过多轮提示评估脑出血检测，人工验证1,726例，比较不同模型组合性能指标

Result: Llama3.3:70b与GPT-4o在AUC(0.78)、AP(0.75-0.76)领先；集成模型MCC值（Top-3 0.558/Full-9 0.571）优于GPT4o单模型(0.522)，统计无显著差异

Conclusion: 中大型开源LLM集成提供更稳定的临床AI工具评估方法，优于单一模型解决方案

Abstract: Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine if an ensemble of
multiple LLM agents could be used collectively to provide a more reliable
assessment of a pixel-based AI triage tool than a single LLM.
  Methods: 29,766 non-contrast CT head exams from fourteen hospitals were
processed by a commercial intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) AI detection tool.
Radiology reports were analyzed by an ensemble of eight open-source LLM models
and a HIPAA compliant internal version of GPT-4o using a single multi-shot
prompt that assessed for presence of ICH. 1,726 examples were manually
reviewed. Performance characteristics of the eight open-source models and
consensus were compared to GPT-4o. Three ideal consensus LLM ensembles were
tested for rating the performance of the triage tool.
  Results: The cohort consisted of 29,766 head CTs exam-report pairs. The
highest AUC performance was achieved with llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AUC= 0.78).
The average precision was highest for Llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AP=0.75 & 0.76).
Llama3.3:70b had the highest F1 score (0.81) and recall (0.85), greater
precision (0.78), specificity (0.72), and MCC (0.57). Using MCC (95% CI) the
ideal combination of LLMs were: Full-9 Ensemble 0.571 (0.552-0.591), Top-3
Ensemble 0.558 (0.537-0.579), Consensus 0.556 (0.539-0.574), and GPT4o 0.522
(0.500-0.543). No statistically significant differences were observed between
Top-3, Full-9, and Consensus (p > 0.05).
  Conclusion: An ensemble of medium to large sized open-source LLMs provides a
more consistent and reliable method to derive a ground truth retrospective
evaluation of a clinical AI triage tool over a single LLM alone.

Motivation: 现有LLM方法生成的知识图谱存在节点重复和法律噪声问题，导致图谱碎片化，难以支撑法律案件分析。

Method: 集成类型感知核心解析模块（消除指代歧义）和领域引导的结构化提示（规范实体抽取），形成迭代优化框架。

Result: 消融实验显示：核心解析缺失导致节点重复率+28.32%；结构化提示缺失导致噪声节点+73.33%。

Conclusion: 该研究为复杂法律文本的结构化处理提供了模块化设计范式，证明核心解析与领域提示的协同增效作用。

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze.
Legal case documents offer critical insights but are often unstructured,
lexically dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, which pose
significant challenges for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. While
recent LLM-based approaches improve over static templates, they still generate
noisy, fragmented graphs with duplicate nodes due to the absence of guided
extraction and coreference resolution. The recently proposed CORE-KG framework
addresses these limitations by integrating a type-aware coreference module and
domain-guided structured prompts, significantly reducing node duplication and
legal noise. In this work, we present a systematic ablation study of CORE-KG to
quantify the individual contributions of its two key components. Our results
show that removing coreference resolution results in a 28.32% increase in node
duplication and a 4.32% increase in noisy nodes, while removing structured
prompts leads to a 4.34% increase in node duplication and a 73.33% increase in
noisy nodes. These findings offer empirical insights for designing robust
LLM-based pipelines for extracting structured representations from complex
legal texts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希伯来语未加音标时存在高度歧义性，严重影响发音准确性和语义理解。现有机器学习方法虽有效但依赖复杂语言分析，需要更简洁高效的自动化方案。

Method: 1. 将音标恢复转化为零样本分类任务
2. 采用视觉语言模型处理文本图像获取向量表示
3. 基于上下文动态生成候选音标模式库
4. 通过架构优化提升系统泛化能力

Result: 在Oracle设置（正确候选存在）下达到高准确率，架构改进使泛化能力显著提升。系统无需复杂语言学分析即可有效完成音标标注。

Conclusion: 视觉表征方法为希伯来语音标自动化提供了新范式，DIVRIT证明了该方向的有效性，未来可扩展至其他闪族语言处理。

Abstract: Diacritics restoration in Hebrew is a fundamental task for ensuring accurate
word pronunciation and disambiguating textual meaning. Despite the language's
high degree of ambiguity when unvocalized, recent machine learning approaches
have significantly advanced performance on this task.
  In this work, we present DIVRIT, a novel system for Hebrew diacritization
that frames the task as a zero-shot classification problem. Our approach
operates at the word level, selecting the most appropriate diacritization
pattern for each undiacritized word from a dynamically generated candidate set,
conditioned on the surrounding textual context. A key innovation of DIVRIT is
its use of a Hebrew Visual Language Model, which processes undiacritized text
as an image, allowing diacritic information to be embedded directly within the
input's vector representation.
  Through a comprehensive evaluation across various configurations, we
demonstrate that the system effectively performs diacritization without relying
on complex, explicit linguistic analysis. Notably, in an ``oracle'' setting
where the correct diacritized form is guaranteed to be among the provided
candidates, DIVRIT achieves a high level of accuracy. Furthermore, strategic
architectural enhancements and optimized training methodologies yield
significant improvements in the system's overall generalization capabilities.
These findings highlight the promising potential of visual representations for
accurate and automated Hebrew diacritization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 发现Transformer语言模型中的线性关系解码器本质是基于语义属性而非具体关系，揭示其高压缩性和有限泛化能力的根源


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多关系场景下线性解码器的组织结构，解释Hernandez等人发现的单关系现象在复杂关系中的表现规律

Method: 通过张量网络压缩解码器集合，设计跨关系评估协议验证解码器对语义属性的提取能力

Result: 解码器存在显著冗余（压缩后精度保持94%），能提取重复的粗粒度语义属性（如'国家相关属性'），仅能泛化到语义相近的新关系

Conclusion: 线性关系解码本质是属性导向的，这种属性中心结构既解释其可压缩性，也说明其泛化局限源于语义相似性要求

Abstract: This paper investigates the structure of linear operators introduced in
Hernandez et al. [2023] that decode specific relational facts in transformer
language models. We extend their single-relation findings to a collection of
relations and systematically chart their organization. We show that such
collections of relation decoders can be highly compressed by simple order-3
tensor networks without significant loss in decoding accuracy. To explain this
surprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we
apply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our
results reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but
extract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital
city and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This
property-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and
highlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically
close. Our findings thus interpret linear relational decoding in transformer
language models as primarily property-based, rather than relation-specific.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度搜索场景中奖励密度低导致智能体需承担高昂探索成本，阻碍了可验证奖励强化学习（RLVR）的实际应用

Method: 1) 子问题分解：将长程任务拆解分配过程奖励
2) 失败引导提示：向停滞轨迹注入修正引导
3) 双代理精炼：通过研究历史合成压缩认知负荷

Result: 在多个深度搜索基准测试中显著优于基线模型，轻量级LLM可达到与高级私有LLM相媲美的性能

Conclusion: InfoFlow通过系统性解决方案有效平衡探索成本与奖励获取，其模块化设计为强化学习的实际应用提供了新范式

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for enhancing agentic deep search. However, its application is often hindered
by low \textbf{Reward Density} in deep search scenarios, where agents expend
significant exploratory costs for infrequent and often null final rewards. In
this paper, we formalize this challenge as the \textbf{Reward Density
Optimization} problem, which aims to improve the reward obtained per unit of
exploration cost. This paper introduce \textbf{InfoFlow}, a systematic
framework that tackles this problem from three aspects. 1) \textbf{Subproblem
decomposition}: breaking down long-range tasks to assign process rewards,
thereby providing denser learning signals. 2) \textbf{Failure-guided hints}:
injecting corrective guidance into stalled trajectories to increase the
probability of successful outcomes. 3) \textbf{Dual-agent refinement}:
employing a dual-agent architecture to offload the cognitive burden of deep
exploration. A refiner agent synthesizes the search history, which effectively
compresses the researcher's perceived trajectory, thereby reducing exploration
cost and increasing the overall reward density. We evaluate InfoFlow on
multiple agentic search benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms strong
baselines, enabling lightweight LLMs to achieve performance comparable to
advanced proprietary LLMs.

Motivation: 针对LLMs自回归特性和大模型规模导致的推理延迟问题，现有方法（如EAGLE系列）未充分考虑GPU设备、批处理规模等系统级变量对推测解码性能的影响。

Method: 提出CAST动态树解码框架，建立包含GPU配置、批处理规模等推理成本的评估体系，实时优化推测解码的树结构构建过程。

Result: 在6个任务和6种LLMs的测试中，相比传统解码方法获得最高5.2倍加速，且普遍优于现有SOTA方法5%-20%。

Conclusion: 通过系统级参数感知的动态树结构优化，CAST有效降低LLMs推理延迟，在多样化场景中展现出显著优势。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant inference latency challenges
stemming from their autoregressive design and large size. To address this,
speculative decoding emerges as a solution, enabling the simultaneous
generation and validation of multiple tokens. While recent approaches like
EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3 improve speculative decoding using dynamic tree structures,
they often neglect the impact of crucial system variables such as GPU devices
and batch sizes.
  Therefore, we introduce a new dynamic tree decoding approach called CAST that
takes into account inference costs, including factors such as GPU
configurations and batch sizes, to dynamically refine the tree structure.
Through comprehensive experimentation across six diverse tasks and utilizing
six distinct LLMs, our methodology demonstrates remarkable results, achieving
speeds up to 5.2 times faster than conventional decoding methods. Moreover, it
generally outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques from 5% to 20%.

Motivation: 现有系统在处理复杂多页视觉文档（如幻灯片）时，难以进行细粒度的跨页面元素推理。多模态特性、布局敏感性和长上下文依赖是核心挑战

Method: 采用分层代理架构：1) 全局代理捕捉文档主题结构 2) 页面代理分析单页布局 3) 元素代理解析文本/视觉元素。通过query-agnostic表征融合多层级特征

Result: 在专有模型上提升7.9个点，开源模型提升9.8个点，特别在视觉元素定位（+12.3）和跨页推理（+11.5）任务中表现突出

Conclusion: 层级代理机制有效解耦复杂文档理解任务，选择性激活策略平衡计算效率与推理深度，为多模态长文档分析提供新范式

Abstract: Multi-page visual documents such as manuals, brochures, presentations, and
posters convey key information through layout, colors, icons, and cross-slide
references. While large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities in document
understanding, current systems struggle with complex, multi-page visual
documents, particularly in fine-grained reasoning over elements and pages. We
introduce SlideAgent, a versatile agentic framework for understanding
multi-modal, multi-page, and multi-layout documents, especially slide decks.
SlideAgent employs specialized agents and decomposes reasoning into three
specialized levels-global, page, and element-to construct a structured,
query-agnostic representation that captures both overarching themes and
detailed visual or textual cues. During inference, SlideAgent selectively
activates specialized agents for multi-level reasoning and integrates their
outputs into coherent, context-aware answers. Extensive experiments show that
SlideAgent achieves significant improvement over both proprietary (+7.9
overall) and open-source models (+9.8 overall).

Motivation: 针对大语言模型架构快速转向仅解码器模型但缺乏扩展性验证的现状，重新验证编码器-解码器架构的潜在价值

Method: 使用RedPajama V1数据集预训练（1.6T tokens）和FLAN指令微调，比较不同规模（1.5亿-80亿参数）下RedLLM与DecLLM的性能差异

Result: RedLLM展现出与DecLLM相当的扩展能力和上下文扩展性，指令微调后在多项下游任务中表现更优，推理效率提升显著

Conclusion: 编码器-解码器架构仍具开发潜力，其性能效率优势可为大语言模型发展提供新方向

Abstract: Recent large language model (LLM) research has undergone an architectural
shift from encoder-decoder modeling to nowadays the dominant decoder-only
modeling. This rapid transition, however, comes without a rigorous comparative
analysis especially \textit{from the scaling perspective}, raising concerns
that the potential of encoder-decoder models may have been overlooked. To fill
this gap, we revisit encoder-decoder LLM (RedLLM), enhancing it with recent
recipes from decoder-only LLM (DecLLM). We conduct a comprehensive comparison
between RedLLM, pretrained with prefix language modeling (LM), and DecLLM,
pretrained with causal LM, at different model scales, ranging from $\sim$150M
to $\sim$8B. Using RedPajama V1 (1.6T tokens) for pretraining and FLAN for
instruction tuning, our experiments show that RedLLM produces compelling
scaling properties and surprisingly strong performance. While DecLLM is overall
more compute-optimal during pretraining, RedLLM demonstrates comparable scaling
and context length extrapolation capabilities. After instruction tuning, RedLLM
achieves comparable and even better results on various downstream tasks while
enjoying substantially better inference efficiency. We hope our findings could
inspire more efforts on re-examining RedLLM, unlocking its potential for
developing powerful and efficient LLMs.

Motivation: 医疗等数据敏感领域缺乏高质量训练语料，传统微调方法需要大量数据且难以保证知识一致性

Method: 通过本体规则三阶段框架：1) 从原始模型提取领域本体 2) 基于核心规则检测知识冲突 3) 自蒸馏微调强化知识

Result: 在医疗QA基准测试中准确率提升3.7%，超越监督基线且保持鲁棒性

Conclusion: Evontree实现了无需大数据的高效领域适应，验证了本体规则对LLMs知识增强的有效性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities
across multiple domains by leveraging massive pre-training and curated
fine-tuning data. However, in data-sensitive fields such as healthcare, the
lack of high-quality, domain-specific training corpus hinders LLMs' adaptation
for specialized applications. Meanwhile, domain experts have distilled domain
wisdom into ontology rules, which formalize relationships among concepts and
ensure the integrity of knowledge management repositories. Viewing LLMs as
implicit repositories of human knowledge, we propose Evontree, a novel
framework that leverages a small set of high-quality ontology rules to
systematically extract, validate, and enhance domain knowledge within LLMs,
without requiring extensive external datasets. Specifically, Evontree extracts
domain ontology from raw models, detects inconsistencies using two core
ontology rules, and reinforces the refined knowledge via self-distilled
fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on medical QA benchmarks with
Llama3-8B-Instruct and Med42-v2 demonstrate consistent outperformance over both
unmodified models and leading supervised baselines, achieving up to a 3.7%
improvement in accuracy. These results confirm the effectiveness, efficiency,
and robustness of our approach for low-resource domain adaptation of LLMs.

Motivation: 解决传统全注意力机制在计算资源消耗和长上下文处理效率低下的问题，特别是在KV缓存和吞吐量方面的瓶颈。

Method: 结合Kimi Delta Attention（精细门控机制增强有限状态RNN内存利用）和DPLR变体算法（硬件高效的块状计算架构），采用3B激活参数/48B总参数的混合注意力模型。

Result: 较全MLA模型性能显著提升（所有任务）、KV缓存减少75%、1M上下文解码吞吐量提高6倍，并开源核心组件与模型参数。

Conclusion: Kimi Linear可作为全注意力架构的高效替代方案，尤其在长输入/输出场景中兼具性能优势与工程实用性。

Abstract: We introduce Kimi Linear, a hybrid linear attention architecture that, for
the first time, outperforms full attention under fair comparisons across
various scenarios -- including short-context, long-context, and reinforcement
learning (RL) scaling regimes. At its core lies Kimi Delta Attention (KDA), an
expressive linear attention module that extends Gated DeltaNet with a
finer-grained gating mechanism, enabling more effective use of limited
finite-state RNN memory. Our bespoke chunkwise algorithm achieves high hardware
efficiency through a specialized variant of the Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR)
transition matrices, which substantially reduces computation compared to the
general DPLR formulation while remaining more consistent with the classical
delta rule.
  We pretrain a Kimi Linear model with 3B activated parameters and 48B total
parameters, based on a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention
(MLA). Our experiments show that with an identical training recipe, Kimi Linear
outperforms full MLA with a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks, while
reducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6 times decoding
throughput for a 1M context. These results demonstrate that Kimi Linear can be
a drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior
performance and efficiency, including tasks with longer input and output
lengths.
  To support further research, we open-source the KDA kernel and vLLM
implementations, and release the pre-trained and instruction-tuned model

Conclusion: 开创指令控制解码新范式，使模型能根据自然语言指令实时调整采样策略，为可操控LLM交互奠定基础

Abstract: The "end-to-end" label for LLMs is a misnomer. In practice, they depend on a
non-differentiable decoding process that requires laborious, hand-tuning of
hyperparameters like temperature and top-p. This paper introduces AutoDeco, a
novel architecture that enables truly "end-to-end" generation by learning to
control its own decoding strategy. We augment the standard transformer with
lightweight heads that, at each step, dynamically predict context-specific
temperature and top-p values alongside the next-token logits. This approach
transforms decoding into a parametric, token-level process, allowing the model
to self-regulate its sampling strategy within a single forward pass.
  Through extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, we demonstrate that
AutoDeco not only significantly outperforms default decoding strategies but
also achieves performance comparable to an oracle-tuned baseline derived from
"hacking the test set"-a practical upper bound for any static method.
Crucially, we uncover an emergent capability for instruction-based decoding
control: the model learns to interpret natural language commands (e.g.,
"generate with low randomness") and adjusts its predicted temperature and top-p
on a token-by-token basis, opening a new paradigm for steerable and interactive
LLM decoding.

Method: 使用Llama-3/Qwen系列不同尺寸模型，结合SFT和偏好优化数据集（含人工合成可控数据集），对比分析训练阶段的价值漂移

Result: 监督微调阶段确立模型价值观框架；偏好优化阶段难以改变既有价值观；不同算法在相同数据下产生不同价值观结果

Conclusion: 价值观对齐主要发生在SFT阶段，后续偏好优化的算法选择比数据本身对最终价值观影响更大，指导模型训练需重视基础微调阶段

Abstract: As LLMs occupy an increasingly important role in society, they are more and
more confronted with questions that require them not only to draw on their
general knowledge but also to align with certain human value systems.
Therefore, studying the alignment of LLMs with human values has become a
crucial field of inquiry. Prior work, however, mostly focuses on evaluating the
alignment of fully trained models, overlooking the training dynamics by which
models learn to express human values. In this work, we investigate how and at
which stage value alignment arises during the course of a model's
post-training. Our analysis disentangles the effects of post-training
algorithms and datasets, measuring both the magnitude and time of value drifts
during training. Experimenting with Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models of different
sizes and popular supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference optimization
datasets and algorithms, we find that the SFT phase generally establishes a
model's values, and subsequent preference optimization rarely re-aligns these
values. Furthermore, using a synthetic preference dataset that enables
controlled manipulation of values, we find that different preference
optimization algorithms lead to different value alignment outcomes, even when
preference data is held constant. Our findings provide actionable insights into
how values are learned during post-training and help to inform data curation,
as well as the selection of models and algorithms for preference optimization
to improve model alignment to human values.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高中数学竞赛基准（如AIME）因性能饱和和数据记忆问题无法有效评估先进LLMs，需创建更高难度、防泄漏的测试标准。

Method: 1) 专家交叉验证确保IMO级难度 2) 完全原创题目避免数据泄露 3) 仅需最终答案的自动评分体系

Result: 26个LLM测试显示：最高准确率52.4%，80%模型低于40%；测试时计算资源增加呈现显著性能提升趋势

Conclusion: AMO-Bench为LLM数学推理能力评估提供更严格标准，揭示当前模型存在巨大改进空间，推动相关算法优化研究。

Abstract: We present AMO-Bench, an Advanced Mathematical reasoning benchmark with
Olympiad level or even higher difficulty, comprising 50 human-crafted problems.
Existing benchmarks have widely leveraged high school math competitions for
evaluating mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, many existing math competitions are becoming less effective for
assessing top-tier LLMs due to performance saturation (e.g., AIME24/25). To
address this, AMO-Bench introduces more rigorous challenges by ensuring all 50
problems are (1) cross-validated by experts to meet at least the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) difficulty standards, and (2) entirely original
problems to prevent potential performance leakages from data memorization.
Moreover, each problem in AMO-Bench requires only a final answer rather than a
proof, enabling automatic and robust grading for evaluation. Experimental
results across 26 LLMs on AMO-Bench show that even the best-performing model
achieves only 52.4% accuracy on AMO-Bench, with most LLMs scoring below 40%.
Beyond these poor performances, our further analysis reveals a promising
scaling trend with increasing test-time compute on AMO-Bench. These results
highlight the significant room for improving the mathematical reasoning in

TL;DR: 提出了Gistify评估任务，要求代码大模型生成最小可复现代码文件，当前SOTA模型在此类代码库级任务中表现欠佳


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着代码代理在大型代码库中的广泛应用，需要自动设计具有挑战性的代码库级评估方法

Method: 通过给定完整代码库和执行入口，要求模型生成仅包含必要组件的自包含文件来复现指定功能

Result: 当前最先进模型在Gistify任务（特别是长执行链任务）中表现不稳定

Conclusion: Gistify任务有效检验代码大模型的结构理解、执行流建模和大规模代码补丁生成能力

Abstract: As coding agents are increasingly deployed in large codebases, the need to
automatically design challenging, codebase-level evaluation is central. We
propose Gistify, a task where a coding LLM must create a single, minimal,
self-contained file that can reproduce a specific functionality of a codebase.
The coding LLM is given full access to a codebase along with a specific
entrypoint (e.g., a python command), and the generated file must replicate the
output of the same command ran under the full codebase, while containing only
the essential components necessary to execute the provided command. Success on
Gistify requires both structural understanding of the codebase, accurate
modeling of its execution flow as well as the ability to produce potentially
large code patches. Our findings show that current state-of-the-art models
struggle to reliably solve Gistify tasks, especially ones with long executions
traces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动方法只能生成固定布局而无法生成布局结构，需要开发能自动生成显式结构化布局的解决方案

Method: 使用结构序列化表示布局，将结构信息与元素位置解耦，采用Transformer架构进行条件生成

Result: 在结构化布局生成任务中超越基准方法，并验证了布局结构提取和迁移的有效性

Conclusion: 首个实现条件式结构化布局生成的数据驱动方法，能显式生成逼真布局结构，代码已开源促进应用

Abstract: Structured layouts are preferable in many 2D visual contents (\eg, GUIs,
webpages) since the structural information allows convenient layout editing.
Computational frameworks can help create structured layouts but require heavy
labor input. Existing data-driven approaches are effective in automatically
generating fixed layouts but fail to produce layout structures. We present
StructLayoutFormer, a novel Transformer-based approach for conditional
structured layout generation. We use a structure serialization scheme to
represent structured layouts as sequences. To better control the structures of
generated layouts, we disentangle the structural information from the element
placements. Our approach is the first data-driven approach that achieves
conditional structured layout generation and produces realistic layout
structures explicitly. We compare our approach with existing data-driven layout
generation approaches by including post-processing for structure extraction.
Extensive experiments have shown that our approach exceeds these baselines in
conditional structured layout generation. We also demonstrate that our approach
is effective in extracting and transferring layout structures. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推荐系统数据集无法反映真实用户行为，且评估标准不一致导致结论模糊，制约推荐系统的研究发展。

Method: 构建ORBIT基准：1) 标准化评估框架（可复现数据集分割/透明排行榜） 2) 基于真实用户浏览数据构建ClueWeb-Reco网页推荐隐藏测试集（8.7亿网页序列）

Result: 1) 公开测试集显示推荐模型总体改进但个体差异大 2) 隐藏测试暴露传统模型在网页推荐场景的泛化能力局限，LLM基线展现改进潜力

Conclusion: ORBIT通过标准化评估和真实场景测试推动推荐系统发展，LLM整合可能成为重要突破方向，基准平台已开源。

Abstract: Recommender systems are among the most impactful AI applications, interacting
with billions of users every day, guiding them to relevant products, services,
or information tailored to their preferences. However, the research and
development of recommender systems are hindered by existing datasets that fail
to capture realistic user behaviors and inconsistent evaluation settings that
lead to ambiguous conclusions. This paper introduces the Open Recommendation
Benchmark for Reproducible Research with HIdden Tests (ORBIT), a unified
benchmark for consistent and realistic evaluation of recommendation models.
ORBIT offers a standardized evaluation framework of public datasets with
reproducible splits and transparent settings for its public leaderboard.
Additionally, ORBIT introduces a new webpage recommendation task, ClueWeb-Reco,
featuring web browsing sequences from 87 million public, high-quality webpages.
ClueWeb-Reco is a synthetic dataset derived from real, user-consented, and
privacy-guaranteed browsing data. It aligns with modern recommendation
scenarios and is reserved as the hidden test part of our leaderboard to
challenge recommendation models' generalization ability. ORBIT measures 12
representative recommendation models on its public benchmark and introduces a
prompted LLM baseline on the ClueWeb-Reco hidden test. Our benchmark results
reflect general improvements of recommender systems on the public datasets,
with variable individual performances. The results on the hidden test reveal
the limitations of existing approaches in large-scale webpage recommendation
and highlight the potential for improvements with LLM integrations. ORBIT

TL;DR: 提出人-LLM协作框架，通过拒绝采样重建思维轨迹，显著提升评估任务中LLM与人类的一致性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在需要复杂推理的主观评估任务中可靠性不足，传统标签数据无法捕捉人类判断的思维过程

Method: 构建协作框架重构思维轨迹，应用于：1.微调开放LLM评估器 2.合成清晰标注指南

Result: 多数据集显示LLM-人类一致性显著提升，优化指南增强不同LLM模型间共识

Conclusion: LLM可作为人类思维代理，将标签数据升级为思维轨迹增强资源，提升评估可靠性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as raters for evaluation
tasks. However, their reliability is often limited for subjective tasks, when
human judgments involve subtle reasoning beyond annotation labels. Thinking
traces, the reasoning behind a judgment, are highly informative but challenging
to collect and curate. We present a human-LLM collaborative framework to infer
thinking traces from label-only annotations. The proposed framework uses a
simple and effective rejection sampling method to reconstruct these traces at
scale. These inferred thinking traces are applied to two complementary tasks:
(1) fine-tuning open LLM raters; and (2) synthesizing clearer annotation
guidelines for proprietary LLM raters. Across multiple datasets, our methods
lead to significantly improved LLM-human agreement. Additionally, the refined
annotation guidelines increase agreement among different LLM models. These
results suggest that LLMs can serve as practical proxies for otherwise
unrevealed human thinking traces, enabling label-only corpora to be extended
into thinking-trace-augmented resources that enhance the reliability of LLM
raters.

Abstract: Aligning LLM-based judges with human preferences is a significant challenge,
as they are difficult to calibrate and often suffer from rubric sensitivity,
bias, and instability. Overcoming this challenge advances key applications,
such as creating reliable reward models for Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) and building effective routing systems that select the
best-suited model for a given user query. In this work, we propose a framework
for modeling diverse, persona-based preferences by learning to aggregate
outputs from multiple rubric-conditioned judges. We investigate the performance
of this approach against naive baselines and assess its robustness through case
studies on both human and LLM-judges biases. Our primary contributions include
a persona-based method for synthesizing preference labels at scale and two
distinct implementations of our aggregator: Generalized Additive Model (GAM)
and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can elicit strong reasoning in large language
models (LLMs), yet most open efforts focus on math and code. We propose
Reasoning Curriculum, a simple two-stage curriculum that first elicits
reasoning skills in pretraining-aligned domains such as math, then adapts and
refines these skills across other domains via joint RL. Stage 1 performs a
brief cold start and then math-only RL with verifiable rewards to develop
reasoning skills. Stage 2 runs joint RL on mixed-domain data to transfer and
consolidate these skills. The curriculum is minimal and backbone-agnostic,
requiring no specialized reward models beyond standard verifiability checks.
Evaluated on Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B over a multi-domain suite, reasoning
curriculum yields consistent gains. Ablations and a cognitive-skill analysis
indicate that both stages are necessary and that math-first elicitation
increases cognitive behaviors important for solving complex problems. Reasoning
Curriculum provides a compact, easy-to-adopt recipe for general reasoning.

Method: 基于规则评分框架生成多维采样数据，构建包含30K挑战性任务的ToolPref-Pairwise数据集，并开发轻量级生成式奖励模型ToolRM。

Result: Qwen3-4B/8B模型在BFCL基准上奖励判断准确率提升14.28%，推理时令牌消耗减少66%，超越Claude4/OpenAI o3等前沿模型。

Conclusion: ToolRM验证了轻量化奖励模型在工具使用场景的有效性，其构建方法论和开放数据集为智能代理系统的强化学习提供了新范式。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences. Yet in the domain of tool learning, the lack of
RMs specifically designed for function-calling tasks has limited progress
toward more capable agentic AI. We introduce ToolRM, a family of lightweight
generative RMs tailored for general tool-use scenarios. To build these models,
we propose a novel pipeline that constructs pairwise preference data using
rule-based scoring and multidimensional sampling. This yields
ToolPref-Pairwise-30K, a diverse, balanced, and challenging dataset of critique
tasks that supports reinforcement learning with verifiable feedback. To
evaluate tool-use RMs, we also introduce TRBench$_{BFCL}$, a benchmark built on
the agentic evaluation suite BFCL. Trained on our constructed data, models from
the Qwen3-4B/8B series achieve up to 14.28% higher accuracy, substantially
outperforming frontier models such as Claude 4 and OpenAI o3 in pairwise reward
judgments. Beyond training objectives, ToolRM generalizes to broader critique
tasks, including Best-of-N sampling and self-correction. Experiments on
ACEBench highlight its effectiveness and efficiency, enabling inference-time
scaling and reducing output token usage by over 66%. We release data and model
checkpoints to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Karl Marx once wrote that ``the human essence is the ensemble of social
relations'', suggesting that individuals are not isolated entities but are
fundamentally shaped by their interactions with other entities, within which
contexts play a constitutive and essential role. With the advent of computers
and artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely
human--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well.
Then a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our
situations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently
introduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as
a recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be
traced back more than twenty years. Since the early 1990s, the field has
evolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by the intelligence
level of machines: from early human--computer interaction frameworks built
around primitive computers, to today's human--agent interaction paradigms
driven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human--level or superhuman
intelligence in the future. In this paper, we situate context engineering,
provide a systematic definition, outline its historical and conceptual
landscape, and examine key design considerations for practice. By addressing
these questions, we aim to offer a conceptual foundation for context
engineering and sketch its promising future. This paper is a stepping stone for
a broader community effort toward systematic context engineering in AI systems.

Abstract: Normative reasoning is a type of reasoning that involves normative or deontic
modality, such as obligation and permission. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks, their
ability to handle normative reasoning remains underexplored. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the normative domain
from both logical and modal perspectives. Specifically, to assess how well LLMs
reason with normative modals, we make a comparison between their reasoning with
normative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals, which share a
common formal structure. To this end, we introduce a new dataset covering a
wide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic
domains, while also incorporating non-formal cognitive factors that influence
human reasoning. Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to
valid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific
types of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those
observed in psychological studies of human reasoning. These findings highlight
challenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and
provide insights for enhancing their reliability. All data and code are

Conclusion: AsyncThink通过动态思考结构和强化学习的结合，为代理协作提供了高效的问题解决范式

Abstract: We envision a new era of AI, termed agentic organization, where agents solve
complex problems by working collaboratively and concurrently, enabling outcomes
beyond individual intelligence. To realize this vision, we introduce
asynchronous thinking (AsyncThink) as a new paradigm of reasoning with large
language models, which organizes the internal thinking process into
concurrently executable structures. Specifically, we propose a thinking
protocol where an organizer dynamically assigns sub-queries to workers, merges
intermediate knowledge, and produces coherent solutions. More importantly, the
thinking structure in this protocol can be further optimized through
reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate that AsyncThink achieves 28%
lower inference latency compared to parallel thinking while improving accuracy
on mathematical reasoning. Moreover, AsyncThink generalizes its learned
asynchronous thinking capabilities, effectively tackling unseen tasks without
additional training.

19-problem benchmark repeated on university cluster (seven models including
Falcon-Mamba state-space architecture) and Nebius AI Studio (nine
state-of-the-art models: Hermes-4 70B/405B, LLaMA 3.1-405B/3.3-70B, Qwen3

  The findings challenge conventional scaling assumptions, establish training
data quality as more critical than model size, and provide actionable

contexts. The tri-infrastructure methodology and 79-problem benchmark enable
longitudinal tracking of reasoning capabilities as foundation models evolve.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTS评估过度依赖词级准确率指标（如WER），无法反映真实场景的语音复杂度与人类理解需求，亟需建立更贴近现实的可懂度评估体系。

Method: 提出SP-MCQA主观评估范式（通过多选题测试关键信息准确性），并构建8.76小时新闻领域基准数据集SP-MCQA-Eval。

Result: 实验表明低WER不等于高关键信息准确率，暴露传统指标与实践需求的鸿沟。即使SOTA模型在文本规范化与音素准确性方面仍存在缺陷。

Conclusion: 在多数系统已实现低WER的现状下，需要建立更高层次、更贴近真实场景的评估标准，以推动真正具备实用价值的语音合成技术发展。

Abstract: The evaluation of intelligibility for TTS has reached a bottleneck, as
existing assessments heavily rely on word-by-word accuracy metrics such as WER,
which fail to capture the complexity of real-world speech or reflect human
comprehension needs. To address this, we propose Spoken-Passage Multiple-Choice
Question Answering, a novel subjective approach evaluating the accuracy of key
information in synthesized speech, and release SP-MCQA-Eval, an 8.76-hour
news-style benchmark dataset for SP-MCQA evaluation. Our experiments reveal
that low WER does not necessarily guarantee high key-information accuracy,
exposing a gap between traditional metrics and practical intelligibility.
SP-MCQA shows that even state-of-the-art (SOTA) models still lack robust text
normalization and phonetic accuracy. This work underscores the urgent need for
high-level, more life-like evaluation criteria now that many systems already
excel at WER yet may fall short on real-world intelligibility.

Conclusion: MemEIC突破了多模态持续知识编辑的技术瓶颈，为动态更新视觉语言模型提供了可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: The dynamic nature of information necessitates continuously updating large
vision-language models (LVLMs). While recent knowledge editing techniques hint
at promising directions, they often focus on editing a single modality (vision
or language) in isolation. This prevalent practice neglects the inherent
multimodality of LVLMs and the continuous nature of knowledge updates,
potentially leading to suboptimal editing outcomes when considering the
interplay between modalities and the need for ongoing knowledge refinement. To
address these limitations, we propose MemEIC, a novel method for Continual and
Compositional Knowledge Editing (CCKE) in LVLMs. MemEIC enables compositional
editing of both visual and textual knowledge sequentially. Our approach employs
a hybrid external-internal editor featuring a dual external memory for
cross-modal evidence retrieval and dual LoRA adapters that facilitate
disentangled parameter updates for each modality. A key component is a
brain-inspired knowledge connector, activated selectively for compositional
reasoning, that integrates information across different modalities. Experiments
demonstrate that MemEIC significantly improves performance on complex
multimodal questions and effectively preserves prior edits, setting a new
benchmark for CCKE in LVLMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards has recently catalyzed a
wave of "MLLM-r1" approaches that bring RL to vision language models. Most
representative paradigms begin with a cold start, typically employing
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to initialize the policy before RL. However,
SFT-based cold start adopts the reasoning paradigm intertwined with task
solution and output format, which may induce instruction-style overfitting,
weakens out-of-distribution generalization, and ultimately affects downstream
RL. We revisit the cold start along two views, its training method and data
construction, and introduce the Generalization Factor (GF) coefficient to
quantify the generalization capability under different methods. Our empirical
study finds that preference-based training methods (e.g. DPO) generalizes
better than SFT-based methods in cold start. Motivated by this, we propose
SPECS-a Self-distilled, Preference-based Cold Start framework that decouples
multimodal learning: (1) generates introspective preference data pairs via
self-distillation, avoiding reliance on larger teachers or manual annotation;
(2) performs preference-based training to learn, focusing on shallow,
transferable surface-form criteria (format, structure, style) rather than
memorizing content; and (3) hands off to RL with verifiable rewards for deep
reasoning results. Experimental results across multiple multimodal benchmarks
show that our decoupling learning framework yields consistent performance gains
over strong baselines, improving MEGA-Bench by 4.1% and MathVista by 12.2%.
Additional experiments indicate that SPECS contributes to reducing
in-distribution "stuckness," improving exploration, stabilizing training, and
raising the performance ceiling.

out-of-distribution data remains underexplored. This study investigates the
effect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of ``debiasing''
capabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language
inference (NLI) and image classification tasks. Through extensive experiments,
we illustrate several key findings: (i) overall the debiasing capability of a
model is undermined post-KD; (ii) training a debiased model does not benefit
from injecting teacher knowledge; (iii) although the overall robustness of a
model may remain stable post-distillation, significant variations can occur
across different types of biases; and (iv) we pin-point the internal attention
pattern and circuit that causes the distinct behavior post-KD. Given the above
findings, we propose three effective solutions to improve the distillability of
debiasing methods: developing high quality data for augmentation, implementing
iterative knowledge distillation, and initializing student models with weights
obtained from teacher models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
study on the effect of KD on debiasing and its interenal mechanism at scale.
Our findings provide understandings on how KD works and how to design better
debiasing methods.

TL;DR: 提出参数化记忆的几何视角替代传统关联性存储范式，揭示Transformer通过谱偏差自组织全局几何关系的机制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统序列建模将记忆视为实体共现的暴力查找存在局限，需探索更本质的几何存储机制及其形成原理

Method: 通过隔离Transformer推理实例，结合Node2Vec进行谱分析，验证几何结构的自组织特性

Result: 发现神经嵌入自组织形成全局几何结构，其源于谱偏差而非架构压力，即使不更简洁仍优先形成优雅几何

Conclusion: 几何视角将重塑知识获取/容量研究的底层直觉，并为增强Transformer几何记忆指明可见改进空间

Abstract: In sequence modeling, the parametric memory of atomic facts has been
predominantly abstracted as a brute-force lookup of co-occurrences between
entities. We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how
memory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of
Transformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of
the local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must
have somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global
relationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in
turn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\ell$-fold composition
into an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.
  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding
geometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry,
despite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly
attributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures.
Counterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more
succinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.
  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry
stems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed
arises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also
points to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more
strongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages
revisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like
knowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.

TL;DR: 论文指出在RL微调LLMs时，BF16精度导致的数值不匹配是训练不稳定的根源，改用FP16可有效提升稳定性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过算法或工程调整解决训练不稳定性，但未触及浮点精度本身。BF16的大动态范围引入显著舍入误差，破坏训练与推理的一致性。

Method: 仅将浮点精度从BF16切换至FP16（无需修改模型结构/算法，仅需少量代码改动），利用框架原生支持消除精度不匹配。

Result: FP16实现更稳定的优化过程、更快的收敛速度，在多样化任务、算法及框架中均表现出更强性能。

Conclusion: 应重新评估RL微调中的精度选择：FP16在精度损失与计算稳定性间的平衡优于BF16，且该改进具备易用性和普适性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) often
suffers from instability due to the numerical mismatch between the training and
inference policies. While prior work has attempted to mitigate this issue
through algorithmic corrections or engineering alignments, we show that its
root cause lies in the floating point precision itself. The widely adopted
BF16, despite its large dynamic range, introduces large rounding errors that
breaks the consistency between training and inference. In this work, we
demonstrate that simply reverting to \textbf{FP16} effectively eliminates this
mismatch. The change is simple, fully supported by modern frameworks with only
a few lines of code change, and requires no modification to the model
architecture or learning algorithm. Our results suggest that using FP16
uniformly yields more stable optimization, faster convergence, and stronger
performance across diverse tasks, algorithms and frameworks. We hope these
findings motivate a broader reconsideration of precision trade-offs in RL
fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决社交媒体错误信息高速传播威胁公共话语的问题，需在保护用户隐私前提下实现实时检测。

Method: 1) 完全客户端架构利用Chromium消息API实现本地计算 2) 三阶段训练策略（基础微调+对抗增强+量化压缩）3) 内存优化模型TinyBERT-Quant（14.7MB）

Result: DistilBERT-Quant模型达97.1%宏F1，TinyBERT-Quant在保持95.7%F1的同时将模型压缩至14.7MB、延迟降至40ms

Conclusion: 为政策制定者提供隐私友好的虚假信息治理工具，同时为研究者创造真实场景数据收集可能性，推动检测技术发展。

Abstract: Social platforms distribute information at unprecedented speed, which in turn
accelerates the spread of misinformation and threatens public discourse. We
present FakeZero, a fully client-side, cross-platform browser extension that
flags unreliable posts on Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) while the user
scrolls. All computation, DOM scraping, tokenisation, Transformer inference,
and UI rendering run locally through the Chromium messaging API, so no personal
data leaves the device.FakeZero employs a three-stage training curriculum:
baseline fine-tuning and domain-adaptive training enhanced with focal loss,
adversarial augmentation, and post-training quantisation. Evaluated on a
dataset of 239,000 posts, the DistilBERT-Quant model (67.6 MB) reaches 97.1%
macro-F1, 97.4% accuracy, and an AUROC of 0.996, with a median latency of
approximately 103 ms on a commodity laptop. A memory-efficient TinyBERT-Quant
variant retains 95.7% macro-F1 and 96.1% accuracy while shrinking the model to
14.7 MB and lowering latency to approximately 40 ms, showing that high-quality
fake-news detection is feasible under tight resource budgets with only modest
performance loss.By providing inline credibility cues, the extension can serve
as a valuable tool for policymakers seeking to curb the spread of
misinformation across social networks. With user consent, FakeZero also opens
the door for researchers to collect large-scale datasets of fake news in the
wild, enabling deeper analysis and the development of more robust detection
techniques.

Conclusion: 框架通过迭代优化与结构化推理蒸馏有效提升红队测试效果，模型展现出良好泛化能力

Abstract: The ability of LLM agents to plan and invoke tools exposes them to new safety
risks, making a comprehensive red-teaming system crucial for discovering
vulnerabilities and ensuring their safe deployment. We present SIRAJ: a generic
red-teaming framework for arbitrary black-box LLM agents. We employ a dynamic
two-step process that starts with an agent definition and generates diverse
seed test cases that cover various risk outcomes, tool-use trajectories, and
risk sources. Then, it iteratively constructs and refines model-based
adversarial attacks based on the execution trajectories of former attempts. To
optimize the red-teaming cost, we present a model distillation approach that
leverages structured forms of a teacher model's reasoning to train smaller
models that are equally effective. Across diverse evaluation agent settings,
our seed test case generation approach yields 2 -- 2.5x boost to the coverage
of risk outcomes and tool-calling trajectories. Our distilled 8B red-teamer
model improves attack success rate by 100%, surpassing the 671B Deepseek-R1
model. Our ablations and analyses validate the effectiveness of the iterative
framework, structured reasoning, and the generalization of our red-teamer
models.

Conclusion: PVMark首次解决大模型水印验证的信任悖论，支持第三方公开验证且保持密钥安全，具备实际部署价值。

Abstract: Watermarking schemes for large language models (LLMs) have been proposed to
identify the source of the generated text, mitigating the potential threats
emerged from model theft. However, current watermarking solutions hardly
resolve the trust issue: the non-public watermark detection cannot prove itself
faithfully conducting the detection. We observe that it is attributed to the
secret key mostly used in the watermark detection -- it cannot be public, or
the adversary may launch removal attacks provided the key; nor can it be
private, or the watermarking detection is opaque to the public. To resolve the
dilemma, we propose PVMark, a plugin based on zero-knowledge proof (ZKP),
enabling the watermark detection process to be publicly verifiable by third
parties without disclosing any secret key. PVMark hinges upon the proof of
`correct execution' of watermark detection on which a set of ZKP constraints
are built, including mapping, random number generation, comparison, and
summation. We implement multiple variants of PVMark in Python, Rust and Circom,
covering combinations of three watermarking schemes, three hash functions, and
four ZKP protocols, to show our approach effectively works under a variety of
circumstances. By experimental results, PVMark efficiently enables public
verifiability on the state-of-the-art LLM watermarking schemes yet without
compromising the watermarking performance, promising to be deployed in
practice.

Abstract: Since its introduction, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has rapidly transformed
the landscape of 3D scene representations, inspiring an extensive body of
associated research. Follow-up work includes analyses and contributions that
enhance the efficiency, scalability, and real-world applicability of 3DGS. In
this summary, we present an overview of several key directions that have
emerged in the wake of 3DGS. We highlight advances enabling resource-efficient
training and rendering, the evolution toward dynamic (or four-dimensional,
4DGS) representations, and deeper exploration of the mathematical foundations
underlying its appearance modeling and rendering process. Furthermore, we
examine efforts to bring 3DGS to mobile and virtual reality platforms, its
extension to massive-scale environments, and recent progress toward
near-instant radiance field reconstruction via feed-forward or distributed
computation. Collectively, these developments illustrate how 3DGS has evolved
from a breakthrough representation into a versatile and foundational tool for
3D vision and graphics.

Motivation: 现有运动建模方法多依赖人工设定层次结构或固定运动基元，难以适应不同任务的复杂动态关系。需要数据驱动的层次推断方法提升模型解释性和跨任务泛化能力。

Method: 1. 用图结构表示运动层次（顶点=基本运动单元，边=父子依赖关系）
2. 将全局运动分解为父级继承模式+局部残差
3. 通过可微分图神经网络自动学习层次依赖

Result: 在1D平移/2D旋转运动重建中成功恢复内在层次结构；在动态3D高斯泼溅场景中，比基线方法重建效果更真实、可解释性更强。

Conclusion: HEIR提供了一种自适应的数据驱动分层建模范式，可广泛应用于计算机视觉、图形学等运动相关任务，提升复杂动态建模能力。

Abstract: Hierarchical structures of motion exist across research fields, including
computer vision, graphics, and robotics, where complex dynamics typically arise
from coordinated interactions among simpler motion components. Existing methods
to model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic
hierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability
across different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion
modeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships
directly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based
hierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into
parent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy
inference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent
elemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies
through graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction
approach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and
dynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show
that our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases,
and produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the
baseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable,
data-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation
applicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks. Project Page:

Result: 在跨视角视频生成和稀疏重建基准测试中，定量指标与定性评估均优于基线方法

Conclusion: SEE4D框架通过解耦相机控制与场景建模，推进了从普通视频构建实用4D场景模型的进程

Abstract: Immersive applications call for synthesizing spatiotemporal 4D content from
casual videos without costly 3D supervision. Existing video-to-4D methods
typically rely on manually annotated camera poses, which are labor-intensive
and brittle for in-the-wild footage. Recent warp-then-inpaint approaches
mitigate the need for pose labels by warping input frames along a novel camera
trajectory and using an inpainting model to fill missing regions, thereby
depicting the 4D scene from diverse viewpoints. However, this
trajectory-to-trajectory formulation often entangles camera motion with scene
dynamics and complicates both modeling and inference. We introduce SEE4D, a
pose-free, trajectory-to-camera framework that replaces explicit trajectory
prediction with rendering to a bank of fixed virtual cameras, thereby
separating camera control from scene modeling. A view-conditional video
inpainting model is trained to learn a robust geometry prior by denoising
realistically synthesized warped images and to inpaint occluded or missing
regions across virtual viewpoints, eliminating the need for explicit 3D
annotations. Building on this inpainting core, we design a spatiotemporal
autoregressive inference pipeline that traverses virtual-camera splines and
extends videos with overlapping windows, enabling coherent generation at
bounded per-step complexity. We validate See4D on cross-view video generation
and sparse reconstruction benchmarks. Across quantitative metrics and
qualitative assessments, our method achieves superior generalization and
improved performance relative to pose- or trajectory-conditioned baselines,
advancing practical 4D world modeling from casual videos.

Conclusion: 该框架为沉浸式高保真虚拟世界生成开辟新路径，结合合成数据策略显著提升场景多样性及物理真实性。

Abstract: There are two prevalent ways to constructing 3D scenes: procedural generation
and 2D lifting. Among them, panorama-based 2D lifting has emerged as a
promising technique, leveraging powerful 2D generative priors to produce
immersive, realistic, and diverse 3D environments. In this work, we advance
this technique to generate graphics-ready 3D scenes suitable for physically
based rendering (PBR), relighting, and simulation. Our key insight is to
repurpose 2D generative models for panoramic perception of geometry, textures,
and PBR materials. Unlike existing 2D lifting approaches that emphasize
appearance generation and ignore the perception of intrinsic properties, we
present OmniX, a versatile and unified framework. Based on a lightweight and
efficient cross-modal adapter structure, OmniX reuses 2D generative priors for
a broad range of panoramic vision tasks, including panoramic perception,
generation, and completion. Furthermore, we construct a large-scale synthetic
panorama dataset containing high-quality multimodal panoramas from diverse
indoor and outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our model in panoramic visual perception and graphics-ready 3D scene
generation, opening new possibilities for immersive and physically realistic
virtual world generation.

Abstract: This study examines the effectiveness of spatio-temporal modeling and the
integration of spatial attention mechanisms in deep learning models for
underwater object detection. Specifically, in the first phase, the performance
of temporal-enhanced YOLOv5 variant T-YOLOv5 is evaluated, in comparison with
the standard YOLOv5. For the second phase, an augmented version of T-YOLOv5 is
developed, through the addition of a Convolutional Block Attention Module
(CBAM). By examining the effectiveness of the already pre-existing YOLOv5 and
T-YOLOv5 models and of the newly developed T-YOLOv5 with CBAM. With CBAM, the
research highlights how temporal modeling improves detection accuracy in
dynamic marine environments, particularly under conditions of sudden movements,
partial occlusions, and gradual motion. The testing results showed that YOLOv5
achieved a mAP@50-95 of 0.563, while T-YOLOv5 and T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
outperformed with mAP@50-95 scores of 0.813 and 0.811, respectively,
highlighting their superior accuracy and generalization in detecting complex
objects. The findings demonstrate that T-YOLOv5 significantly enhances
detection reliability compared to the standard model, while T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
further improves performance in challenging scenarios, although there is a loss
of accuracy when it comes to simpler scenarios.

Abstract: Humans can naturally identify, reason about, and explain anomalies in their
environment. In computer vision, this long-standing challenge remains limited
to industrial defects or unrealistic, synthetically generated anomalies,
failing to capture the richness and unpredictability of real-world anomalies.
In this work, we introduce CAVE, the first benchmark of real-world visual
anomalies. CAVE supports three open-ended tasks: anomaly description,
explanation, and justification; with fine-grained annotations for visual
grounding and categorizing anomalies based on their visual manifestations,
their complexity, severity, and commonness. These annotations draw inspiration
from cognitive science research on how humans identify and resolve anomalies,
providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) in detecting and understanding anomalies. We show that state-of-the-art
VLMs struggle with visual anomaly perception and commonsense reasoning, even
with advanced prompting strategies. By offering a realistic and cognitively
grounded benchmark, CAVE serves as a valuable resource for advancing research
in anomaly detection and commonsense reasoning in VLMs.

Conclusion: 当前多模态系统缺乏时间连续性和因果关系的归纳偏置，需突破现有视觉语义关联范式以提升物理时空推理能力

Abstract: Modern vision-language models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet
their grasp of temporal information in video remains weak and, crucially,
under-evaluated. We probe this gap with a deceptively simple but revealing
challenge: judging the arrow of time (AoT)-whether a short clip is played
forward or backward. We introduce AoT-PsyPhyBENCH, a psychophysically validated
benchmark that tests whether VLMs can infer temporal direction in natural
videos using the same stimuli and behavioral baselines established for humans.
Our comprehensive evaluation of open-weight and proprietary, reasoning and
non-reasoning VLMs reveals that most models perform near chance, and even the
best lag far behind human accuracy on physically irreversible processes (e.g.,
free fall, diffusion/explosion) and causal manual actions (division/addition)
that humans recognize almost instantly. These results highlight a fundamental
gap in current multimodal systems: while they capture rich visual-semantic
correlations, they lack the inductive biases required for temporal continuity
and causal understanding. We release the code and data for AoT-PsyPhyBENCH to
encourage further progress in the physical and temporal reasoning capabilities
of VLMs.

Result: 在Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct和InternVL2.5-4B模型上平均提升3.86分

Conclusion: 提出的头部-尾部再平衡策略有效缓解了自改进中的马太效应，突破了性能瓶颈

Abstract: Self-improvement has emerged as a mainstream paradigm for advancing the
reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), where models
explore and learn from successful trajectories iteratively. However, we
identify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating
high-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles
with more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced
optimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while
hindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations,
this imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the "Matthew
effect"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to
performance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four
efficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and
trajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the
exploration-and-learning self-improvement process. Extensive experiments on
Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and InternVL2.5-4B models across visual reasoning tasks
demonstrate that our methods consistently improve visual reasoning
capabilities, outperforming vanilla self-improvement by 3.86 points on average.

TL;DR: 视频生成模型在短期空间连贯性和局部动态一致性表现良好，但在长期因果推理和抽象逻辑方面仍有局限


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证视频模型是否具备复杂视觉场景的零样本推理能力

Method: 通过MME-CoF基准测试从12个维度系统评估Veo-3模型

Result: 模型在空间一致性/细粒度定位表现较好，但在几何约束/抽象逻辑方面存在不足

Conclusion: 视频模型目前需与专用推理模型配合使用，尚未达到独立可靠推理器水平

Abstract: Recent video generation models can produce high-fidelity, temporally coherent
videos, indicating that they may encode substantial world knowledge. Beyond
realistic synthesis, they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual
perception, modeling, and manipulation. Yet, an important question still
remains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging
visual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to
comprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular
Veo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including
spatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically
characterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study,
we curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables
in-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our
findings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning
patterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and
locally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal
reasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. Overall, they are
not yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, but exhibit encouraging
signs as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.

TL;DR: 提出通过视觉干扰物动态调整平移增益的RDW方法，显著提升用户增益阈值同时保持舒适度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究发现用户在分心时对增益不敏感，但未定量测量干扰物对检测阈值的影响

Method: 在用户视野内设置干扰物，当其注意力被吸引时施加更大平移增益，利用注意力机制实现平滑转向

Result: 虚拟环境中引入干扰物使平移增益阈值显著提高，模拟器疾病问卷和临场感问卷证实方法保持舒适度

Conclusion: 基于视觉注意力的动态增益调节方法有效提升RDW系统性能，且用户接受度良好

Abstract: Redirected walking utilizes gain adjustments within perceptual thresholds to
allow natural navigation in large scale virtual environments within confined
physical environments. Previous research has found that when users are
distracted by some scene elements, they are less sensitive to gain values.
However, the effects on detection thresholds have not been quantitatively
measured. In this paper, we present a novel method that dynamically adjusts
translation gain by leveraging visual distractors. We place distractors within
the user's field of view and apply a larger translation gain when their
attention is drawn to them. Because the magnitude of gain adjustment depends on
the user's level of engagement with the distractors, the redirection process
remains smooth and unobtrusive. To evaluate our method, we developed a task
oriented virtual environment for a user study. Results show that introducing
distractors in the virtual environment significantly raises users' translation
gain thresholds. Furthermore, assessments using the Simulator Sickness
Questionnaire and Igroup Presence Questionnaire indicate that the method
maintains user comfort and acceptance, supporting its effectiveness for RDW
systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出动态SQL评估基准DySQL-Bench，通过自动化流程构建多轮交互测试集，发现现有模型在动态场景表现不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Text-to-SQL系统在静态单轮任务表现优异，但无法适应现实交互场景中用户意图持续演变的动态需求。

Method: 采用两阶段自动化流程：基于数据库结构化树生成任务，经交互过滤和专家验证构建数据集；提出LLM模拟用户-模型-数据库的多轮评估框架。

Result: 构建含13领域1072任务的基准集，GPT-4o整体准确率仅58.34%，Pass@5指标仅23.81%，凸显任务难度。

Conclusion: DySQL-Bench填补动态SQL评估空白，揭示现有模型在真实交互场景的局限，为领域发展提供新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-SQL have achieved strong results in static,
single-turn tasks, where models generate SQL queries from natural language
questions. However, these systems fall short in real-world interactive
scenarios, where user intents evolve and queries must be refined over multiple
turns. In applications such as finance and business analytics, users
iteratively adjust query constraints or dimensions based on intermediate
results. To evaluate such dynamic capabilities, we introduce DySQL-Bench, a
benchmark assessing model performance under evolving user interactions. Unlike
previous manually curated datasets, DySQL-Bench is built through an automated
two-stage pipeline of task synthesis and verification. Structured tree
representations derived from raw database tables guide LLM-based task
generation, followed by interaction-oriented filtering and expert validation.
Human evaluation confirms 100% correctness of the synthesized data. We further
propose a multi-turn evaluation framework simulating realistic interactions
among an LLM-simulated user, the model under test, and an executable database.
The model must adapt its reasoning and SQL generation as user intents change.
DySQL-Bench covers 13 domains across BIRD and Spider 2 databases, totaling
1,072 tasks. Even GPT-4o attains only 58.34% overall accuracy and 23.81% on the
Pass@5 metric, underscoring the benchmark's difficulty. All code and data are
released at https://github.com/Aurora-slz/Real-World-SQL-Bench .

TL;DR: 提出多智能体框架Nexus，通过协同审议、沙盒验证和自优化机制显著提升测试预言生成准确率（GPT-4.1-Mini在LiveCodeBench准确率提升11.43%）并改善下游任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统非回归测试中的测试预言生成存在准确率瓶颈，现有方法难以有效验证函数实现的正确性。

Method: 1. 四专家代理协同审议测试预言
2. 生成候选函数实现进行沙盒验证
3. 自优化循环通过运行时错误修正预言

Result: 在7个基准测试中超越SOTA：
- LiveCodeBench测试准确率提升至57.73%
- HumanEval缺陷检测率达95.45%
- 程序修复成功率提升至69.32%

Conclusion: Nexus框架通过结构化多阶段处理机制，有效解决了测试预言生成的关键挑战，显著提升了自动化测试的实用价值。

Abstract: Test oracle generation in non-regression testing is a longstanding challenge
in software engineering, where the goal is to produce oracles that can
accurately determine whether a function under test (FUT) behaves as intended
for a given input. In this paper, we introduce Nexus, a novel multi-agent
framework to address this challenge. Nexus generates test oracles by leveraging
a diverse set of specialized agents that synthesize test oracles through a
structured process of deliberation, validation, and iterative self-refinement.
During the deliberation phase, a panel of four specialist agents, each
embodying a distinct testing philosophy, collaboratively critiques and refines
an initial set of test oracles. Then, in the validation phase, Nexus generates
a plausible candidate implementation of the FUT and executes the proposed
oracles against it in a secure sandbox. For any oracle that fails this
execution-based check, Nexus activates an automated selfrefinement loop, using
the specific runtime error to debug and correct the oracle before
re-validation. Our extensive evaluation on seven diverse benchmarks
demonstrates that Nexus consistently and substantially outperforms
state-of-theart baselines. For instance, Nexus improves the test-level oracle
accuracy on the LiveCodeBench from 46.30% to 57.73% for GPT-4.1-Mini. The
improved accuracy also significantly enhances downstream tasks: the bug
detection rate of GPT4.1-Mini generated test oracles on HumanEval increases
from 90.91% to 95.45% for Nexus compared to baselines, and the success rate of
automated program repair improves from 35.23% to 69.32%.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化代码审查方法在安全问题上存在数据稀缺、评估指标不足的缺陷，且LLM在安全审查中的潜力未被充分挖掘。需要开发专门方法提升安全审查的有效性。

Method: 1. 构建安全代码审查专用数据集 2. 设计安全感知微调策略训练LLM 3. 集成RAG技术减少幻觉 4. 提出SecureBLEU评估指标

Result: 实验表明SecureReviewer在安全检测准确率（+15.6%）和评论实用性（+22.3%）上优于SOTA模型，生成的评论包含更具体的修复建议。

Conclusion: 通过数据建设、模型优化与评估创新三位一体，SecureReviewer为开发早期阶段的安全漏洞检测提供了可靠解决方案，推动自动化代码审查向安全领域深化。

Abstract: Identifying and addressing security issues during the early phase of the
development lifecycle is critical for mitigating the long-term negative impacts
on software systems. Code review serves as an effective practice that enables
developers to check their teammates' code before integration into the codebase.
To streamline the generation of review comments, various automated code review
approaches have been proposed, where LLM-based methods have significantly
advanced the capabilities of automated review generation. However, existing
models primarily focus on general-purpose code review, their effectiveness in
identifying and addressing security-related issues remains underexplored.
Moreover, adapting existing code review approaches to target security issues
faces substantial challenges, including data scarcity and inadequate evaluation
metrics. To address these limitations, we propose SecureReviewer, a new
approach designed for enhancing LLMs' ability to identify and resolve
security-related issues during code review. Specifically, we first construct a
dataset tailored for training and evaluating secure code review capabilities.
Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune LLMs to generate code review comments
that can effectively identify security issues and provide fix suggestions with
our proposed secure-aware fine-tuning strategy. To mitigate hallucination in
LLMs and enhance the reliability of their outputs, we integrate the RAG
technique, which grounds the generated comments in domain-specific security
knowledge. Additionally, we introduce SecureBLEU, a new evaluation metric
designed to assess the effectiveness of review comments in addressing security
issues. Experimental results demonstrate that SecureReviewer outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both security issue detection accuracy and the
overall quality and practical utility of generated review comments.
