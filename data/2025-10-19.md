### [1] [Bridging the Semantic Gap: Contrastive Rewards for Multilingual Text-to-SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13827)
*Ashish Kattamuri,Ishita Prasad,Meetu Malhotra,Arpita Vats,Rahul Raja,Albert Lie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出结合GRPO与多语言对比奖励的框架，显著提升跨语言Text-to-SQL系统的执行准确率（+26pp）和语义准确率（+32.86pp），小模型性能超越大模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Text-to-SQL方法忽视语义对齐问题，且非英语场景执行准确率平均下降6个百分点

Method: 在GRPO框架中集成多语言对比奖励信号，通过语义相似度奖励增强SQL生成与用户意图的匹配

Result: LLaMA-3-3B微调后执行准确率达87.4%，语义准确率59.14%；3B模型超越8B零样本模型执行准确率7.43pp，仅用3000训练样本

Conclusion: 通过对比奖励实现定向语义对齐，无需大规模数据集即可提升Text-to-SQL系统性能，验证小模型高效训练可行性

Abstract: Current Text-to-SQL methods are evaluated and only focused on executable
queries, overlooking the semantic alignment challenge -- both in terms of the
semantic meaning of the query and the correctness of the execution results.
Even execution accuracy itself shows significant drops when moving from English
to other languages, with an average decline of 6 percentage points across
non-English languages. We address these challenges by presenting a new
framework that combines Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) within a
multilingual contrastive reward signal to enhance both task efficiency and
semantic accuracy in Text-to-SQL systems in cross-lingual scenarios. Our method
teaches models to obtain better correspondence between SQL generation and user
intent by combining a reward signal based on semantic similarity. On the
seven-language MultiSpider dataset, fine-tuning the LLaMA-3-3B model with GRPO
improved the execution accuracy up to 87.4 percent (+26 pp over zero-shot) and
semantic accuracy up to 52.29 percent (+32.86 pp). Adding our contrastive
reward signal in the GRPO framework further improved the average semantic
accuracy to 59.14 percent (+6.85 pp, up to +10 pp for Vietnamese). Our
experiments showcase that a smaller, parameter-efficient 3B LLaMA model
fine-tuned with our contrastive reward signal outperforms a much larger
zero-shot 8B LLaMA model, with an uplift of 7.43 pp in execution accuracy (from
81.43 percent on the 8B model to 88.86 percent on the 3B model), and nearly
matches its semantic accuracy (59.14 percent vs. 68.57 percent) -- all using
just 3,000 reinforcement learning training examples. These results demonstrate
how we can improve the performance of Text-to-SQL systems with contrastive
rewards for directed semantic alignment, without requiring large-scale training
datasets.

### [2] [From Explainability to Action: A Generative Operational Framework for Integrating XAI in Clinical Mental Health Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13828)
*Ratna Kandala,Akshata Kishore Moharir,Divya Arvinda Nayak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出生成式操作框架，利用大语言模型将XAI技术输出转化为临床可用的决策叙事


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有XAI技术（如SHAP/LIME）虽能生成特征重要性评分，但缺乏临床可操作的见解，导致技术透明性与临床实用性之间的鸿沟

Method: 构建生成式操作框架，以LLM为核心翻译引擎，结合RAG检索临床指南，将原始XAI输出转化为循证临床叙事

Result: 框架解决工作流程整合、偏差缓解、利益相关者沟通等关键障碍，提供从孤立数据点到可信AI临床应用的实施路线图

Conclusion: 该框架通过技术-临床翻译机制，推动人工智能从实验室技术向真实世界临床决策支持系统的转化

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has been presented as the critical
component for unlocking the potential of machine learning in mental health
screening (MHS). However, a persistent lab-to-clinic gap remains. Current XAI
techniques, such as SHAP and LIME, excel at producing technically faithful
outputs such as feature importance scores, but fail to deliver clinically
relevant, actionable insights that can be used by clinicians or understood by
patients. This disconnect between technical transparency and human utility is
the primary barrier to real-world adoption. This paper argues that this gap is
a translation problem and proposes the Generative Operational Framework, a
novel system architecture that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as a
central translation engine. This framework is designed to ingest the raw,
technical outputs from diverse XAI tools and synthesize them with clinical
guidelines (via RAG) to automatically generate human-readable, evidence-backed
clinical narratives. To justify our solution, we provide a systematic analysis
of the components it integrates, tracing the evolution from intrinsic models to
generative XAI. We demonstrate how this framework directly addresses key
operational barriers, including workflow integration, bias mitigation, and
stakeholder-specific communication. This paper also provides a strategic
roadmap for moving the field beyond the generation of isolated data points
toward the delivery of integrated, actionable, and trustworthy AI in clinical
practice.

### [3] [A Linguistics-Aware LLM Watermarking via Syntactic Predictability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13829)
*Shinwoo Park,Hyejin Park,Hyeseon Ahn,Yo-Sub Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: STELA框架通过语言自由度动态调整水印强度，平衡文本质量与检测鲁棒性，实现无需模型logits的公开验证


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有水印技术依赖模型内部信号导致的公共验证障碍，平衡生成质量与检测性能的矛盾需求

Method: 利用词性n-gram模型量化语言不确定性，在语法受限场景弱化信号保持质量，在灵活场景强化信号提升可检测性

Result: 在英语/中文/韩语的跨语言实验中，检测鲁棒性超越现有方法，代码开源提供验证

Conclusion: STELA通过语言学驱动的水印调制机制，突破公开验证限制，实现质量与检测性能的最优平衡

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance rapidly, reliable
governance tools have become critical. Publicly verifiable watermarking is
particularly essential for fostering a trustworthy AI ecosystem. A central
challenge persists: balancing text quality against detection robustness. Recent
studies have sought to navigate this trade-off by leveraging signals from model
output distributions (e.g., token-level entropy); however, their reliance on
these model-specific signals presents a significant barrier to public
verification, as the detection process requires access to the logits of the
underlying model. We introduce STELA, a novel framework that aligns watermark
strength with the linguistic degrees of freedom inherent in language. STELA
dynamically modulates the signal using part-of-speech (POS) n-gram-modeled
linguistic indeterminacy, weakening it in grammatically constrained contexts to
preserve quality and strengthen it in contexts with greater linguistic
flexibility to enhance detectability. Our detector operates without access to
any model logits, thus facilitating publicly verifiable detection. Through
extensive experiments on typologically diverse languages-analytic English,
isolating Chinese, and agglutinative Korean-we show that STELA surpasses prior
methods in detection robustness. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Shinwoo-Park/stela_watermark.

### [4] [Users as Annotators: LLM Preference Learning from Comparison Mode](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13830)
*Zhongze Cai,Xiaocheng Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出通过用户比较模式收集成对偏好数据，并利用用户行为模型进行质量过滤的方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户作为自身查询的最佳评判专家，但用户标注数据存在质量控制问题。通过不同模型生成响应，利用用户行为模型评估数据质量

Method: 使用两个不同模型生成响应，通过期望最大化算法估计用户潜在质量因子，过滤低质量标注数据

Result: 下游任务验证了用户行为模型的有效性及数据过滤对LLM对齐的提升作用

Conclusion: 用户比较模式与质量评估机制结合，能有效提升对齐数据的收集质量

Abstract: Pairwise preference data have played an important role in the alignment of
large language models (LLMs). Each sample of such data consists of a prompt,
two different responses to the prompt, and a binary label indicating which of
the two responses is better. The labels are usually annotated by professional
human annotators. In this paper, we consider an alternative approach to collect
pairwise preference data -- user annotation from comparison mode. With the
increasingly wider adoption of LLMs among the population, users are
contributing more and more of their preference labels through their daily
interactions with the LLMs. The upside of such labels is that users are the
best experts in judging the responses to their own queries/prompts, but the
downside is the lack of quality control in these labels. In this paper, we
consider a new idea of generating two responses from two different models or
two different versions of the same model. The asymmetry allows us to make an
inference of the user's data quality through our proposed user behavior model.
We develop an expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate a latent quality
factor of the user, and filter users' annotation data accordingly. The
downstream task shows the effectiveness of our approach in both capturing the
user behavior and data filtering for LLM alignment.

### [5] [Informed Routing in LLMs: Smarter Token-Level Computation for Faster Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13831)
*Chao Han,Yijuan Liang,Zihao Xuan,Daokuan Wu,Wei Zhang,Xiaoyu Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于预见性模块(LFF)的知情路由机制，通过评估token重要性和可恢复性优化动态计算分配，在保持模型性能的同时减少40%推理计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态路由方法采用短视的贪婪策略，导致不可逆信息损失和次优token选择。需要同时评估token即时重要性和特征可恢复性来改进路由决策。

Method: 设计轻量级特征预测器(LFF)，在路由决策前预估单元输出，实现灵活的『执行-近似』策略，通过特征近似替代部分计算单元的执行。

Result: 在语言建模和推理任务中达到SOTA效率-性能平衡，未使用LoRA微调即可超越需要全微调的基线模型，同时减少50%以上训练时间。

Conclusion: 知情路由开创了新的动态计算范式，首次实现无需精度妥协的高效推理，为LLM实际部署提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications is
increasingly limited by their high inference cost. While recent advances in
dynamic token-level computation allocation attempt to improve efficiency by
selectively activating model components per token, existing methods rely on
greedy routing--a myopic execute-or-skip mechanism that often leads to
irreversible information loss and suboptimal token selection. This paper
introduces informed routing, a new paradigm that proactively addresses these
issues. The key insight is to assess not only a token's immediate importance
but also its recoverability, i.e., how well its transformation can be
approximated. To this end, we propose the Lightweight Feature Forecaster (LFF),
a small predictive module that estimates a unit's output before routing
decisions are made. This enables a flexible execute-or-approximate policy that
preserves model fidelity while drastically reducing computation. Extensive
experiments on both language modeling and reasoning tasks show that informed
routing achieves state-of-the-art efficiency-performance trade-offs across
multiple sparsity levels. Notably, even without final LoRA fine-tuning, our
method matches or surpasses strong baselines that require full fine-tuning, all
while reducing training time by over 50%. The code is available at:

### [6] [Entropy Meets Importance: A Unified Head Importance-Entropy Score for Stable and Efficient Transformer Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13832)
*Minsik Choi,Hyegang Son,Changhoon Kim,Young Geun Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出HIES剪枝标准，通过整合头部重要性分数与注意力熵，实现Transformer模型高效压缩且保持精度稳定


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HIS剪枝方法仅关注梯度贡献，忽略注意力模式多样性，导致模型质量和稳定性受限

Method: HIES准则融合头部重要性评分与注意力熵值，量化注意力头贡献的互补性证据

Result: 剪枝后模型质量最高提升15.2%，稳定性提升2.04倍，实现大幅压缩而不损失性能

Conclusion: HIES突破了传统单维度剪枝限制，为平衡模型效率与性能提供新方向

Abstract: Transformer-based models have achieved remarkable performance in NLP tasks.
However, their structural characteristics-multiple layers and attention
heads-introduce efficiency challenges in inference and deployment. To address
these challenges, various pruning methods have recently been proposed. Notably,
gradient-based methods using Head Importance Scores (HIS) have gained traction
for interpretability, efficiency, and ability to identify redundant heads.
However, HIS alone has limitations as it captures only the gradient-driven
contribution, overlooking the diversity of attention patterns. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce a novel pruning criterion, HIES (Head
Importance-Entropy Score), which integrates head importance scores with
attention entropy, providing complementary evidence on per-head contribution.
Empirically, HIES-based pruning yields up to 15.2% improvement in model quality
and 2.04x improvement in stability over HIS-only methods, enabling substantial
model compression without sacrificing either accuracy or stability. Code will
be released upon publication.

### [7] [ConDABench: Interactive Evaluation of Language Models for Data Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13835)

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了ConDABench框架，用于生成对话式数据分析基准并系统评估工具性能，揭示新一代LLMs在持续性交互任务中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实数据分析任务存在目标不明确和数据不洁问题，现有基准缺乏对交互性的支持，需通过用户交互理解意图才能解决复杂任务。

Method: 基于公开数据集研究论文构建多智能体工作流，生成1,420个ConDA问题，并开发首个支持系统性评估对话数据分析工具的基础设施。

Result: 新一代模型能解决更多案例，但在需要长期持续交互的任务中未表现出明显优势。

Conclusion: ConDABench为模型开发者提供了衡量模型在复杂交互任务中进展的标准化工具，推动真正协作式AI的发展。

Abstract: Real-world data analysis tasks often come with under-specified goals and
unclean data. User interaction is necessary to understand and disambiguate a
user's intent, and hence, essential to solving these complex tasks. Existing
benchmarks for evaluating LLMs on data analysis tasks do not capture these
complexities or provide first-class support for interactivity. We introduce
ConDABench, a framework for generating conversational data analysis (ConDA)
benchmarks and evaluating external tools on the generated benchmarks. \bench
consists of (a) a multi-agent workflow for generating realistic benchmarks from
articles describing insights gained from public datasets, (b) 1,420 ConDA
problems generated using this workflow, and (c) an evaluation harness that, for
the first time, makes it possible to systematically evaluate conversational
data analysis tools on the generated ConDA problems. Evaluation of
state-of-the-art LLMs on the benchmarks reveals that while the new generation
of models are better at solving more instances, they are not necessarily better
at solving tasks that require sustained, long-form engagement. ConDABench is an
avenue for model builders to measure progress towards truly collaborative
models that can complete complex interactive tasks.

Motivation: 提升可信AI系统的置信度测量，利用无需模型内部信息的黑盒UQ方法增强适应性、降低计算成本并保持系统鲁棒性。

Method: 提出非语言化的相似性聚合框架，通过生成输出的内部一致性估计置信度，并开发基于小训练集的置信度估计模型。

Result: 在问答、摘要生成、文本转SQL等任务中，相似性方法比基线模型能提供更优的校准置信度。

Conclusion: 黑盒UQ方法通过输出一致性评估置信度，可有效提升LLM在复杂生成任务中的可信度，为实际应用提供可靠的不确定性量化方案。

Abstract: When does a large language model (LLM) know what it does not know?
Uncertainty quantification (UQ) provides measures of uncertainty, such as an
estimate of the confidence in an LLM's generated output, and is therefore
increasingly recognized as a crucial component of trusted AI systems. Black-box
UQ methods do not require access to internal model information from the
generating LLM and therefore have numerous real-world advantages, such as
robustness to system changes, adaptability to choice of LLM, reduced costs, and
computational tractability. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of
UQ techniques that are primarily but not necessarily entirely black-box, where
the consistency between a generated output and other sampled generations is
used as a proxy for confidence in its correctness. We propose a high-level
non-verbalized similarity-based aggregation framework that subsumes a broad
swath of UQ approaches suitable for complex generative tasks, as well as
introduce specific novel techniques from the framework that train confidence
estimation models using small training sets. Through an empirical study with
datasets spanning the diverse tasks of question answering, summarization, and
text-to-SQL, we demonstrate that our proposed similarity-based methods can
yield better calibrated confidences than baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出文化感知框架解决仇恨言论检测中的训练数据偏差和文化差异问题，通过构建仇恨子空间使分类性能提升1.05%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视训练标签偏差和文化背景差异导致的仇恨定义分歧，需解决数据稀疏性、文化纠缠和标注模糊三大挑战

Method: 1. 建模文化属性组合缓解数据稀疏
2. 标签传播算法捕捉文化组合特征
3. 构建个人仇恨子空间增强分类性能

Result: 在全部指标上平均超越现有最佳方法1.05%

Conclusion: 通过建模文化多样性及优化数据处理机制，有效提升跨文化场景下的仇恨言论检测效果

Abstract: Hate speech detection has been extensively studied, yet existing methods
often overlook a real-world complexity: training labels are biased, and
interpretations of what is considered hate vary across individuals with
different cultural backgrounds. We first analyze these challenges, including
data sparsity, cultural entanglement, and ambiguous labeling. To address them,
we propose a culture-aware framework that constructs individuals' hate
subspaces. To alleviate data sparsity, we model combinations of cultural
attributes. For cultural entanglement and ambiguous labels, we use label
propagation to capture distinctive features of each combination. Finally,
individual hate subspaces, which in turn can further enhance classification
performance. Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art by 1.05\%
on average across all metrics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 利用大语言模型从评论中自动提取产品本体，性能超越现有BERT基线


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工构建本体耗时费力，电子商务等领域亟需自动化方法处理海量非结构化评论文本

Method: 基于大语言模型开发全自动方法，从原始评论中提取meronymy形式的产品本体

Result: 通过LLM作为评估器，证明该方法生成的ontology优于BERT基线模型

Conclusion: 为LLM在更广泛领域（包括产品及其他）的本体抽取应用奠定基础

Abstract: Ontologies have become essential in today's digital age as a way of
organising the vast amount of readily available unstructured text. In providing
formal structure to this information, ontologies have immense value and
application across various domains, e.g., e-commerce, where countless product
listings necessitate proper product organisation. However, the manual
construction of these ontologies is a time-consuming, expensive and laborious
process. In this paper, we harness the recent advancements in large language
models (LLMs) to develop a fully-automated method of extracting product
ontologies, in the form of meronymies, from raw review texts. We demonstrate
that the ontologies produced by our method surpass an existing, BERT-based
baseline when evaluating using an LLM-as-a-judge. Our investigation provides
the groundwork for LLMs to be used more generally in (product or otherwise)
ontology extraction.

TL;DR: 提出ADMIT投毒攻击方法，在极低投毒率下有效操控RAG系统的事实核查结果，攻击成功率86%且跨模型/检索器通用


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明LLMs易受误导内容影响，但真实场景中可信证据占主导。研究旨在验证存在对抗性证据时，投毒攻击如何颠覆事实核查结论

Method: 开发ADMIT多注入技术：通过语义对齐的少样本投毒，无需访问目标LLM/检索器，即可实现决策反转和虚假论证生成

Result: 跨4类检索器、11种LLM和4个领域基准测试，平均攻击成功率86%（投毒率仅0.93×10⁻⁶），且在强反证据下保持鲁棒性

Conclusion: ADMIT暴露现实RAG系统的重大安全漏洞，攻击成功率较现有方法提升11.2%，凸显事实核查系统防御机制亟待加强

Abstract: Knowledge poisoning poses a critical threat to Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) systems by injecting adversarial content into knowledge bases, tricking
Large Language Models (LLMs) into producing attacker-controlled outputs
grounded in manipulated context. Prior work highlights LLMs' susceptibility to
misleading or malicious retrieved content. However, real-world fact-checking
scenarios are more challenging, as credible evidence typically dominates the
retrieval pool. To investigate this problem, we extend knowledge poisoning to
the fact-checking setting, where retrieved context includes authentic
supporting or refuting evidence. We propose \textbf{ADMIT}
(\textbf{AD}versarial \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{I}njection \textbf{T}echnique), a
few-shot, semantically aligned poisoning attack that flips fact-checking
decisions and induces deceptive justifications, all without access to the
target LLMs, retrievers, or token-level control. Extensive experiments show
that ADMIT transfers effectively across 4 retrievers, 11 LLMs, and 4
cross-domain benchmarks, achieving an average attack success rate (ASR) of 86\%
at an extremely low poisoning rate of $0.93 \times 10^{-6}$, and remaining
robust even in the presence of strong counter-evidence. Compared with prior
state-of-the-art attacks, ADMIT improves ASR by 11.2\% across all settings,
exposing significant vulnerabilities in real-world RAG-based fact-checking
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗基础模型难以协调EHR的表格化/事件型特征与语言模型的序列先验，限制了纵向依赖关系的捕捉能力

Method: 扩展SciBERT模型，通过结构化EHR序列的额外预训练（SerialBEHRT），编码临床事件的时间与上下文关系

Result: 在抗生素敏感性预测任务中，相比现有EHR表征方法表现出更优且更稳定的性能

Conclusion: 时间序列化是医疗基础模型预训练的关键因素，SerialBEHRT的成功验证了领域对齐架构的重要性

Abstract: The emergence of foundation models in healthcare has opened new avenues for
learning generalizable representations from large scale clinical data. Yet,
existing approaches often struggle to reconcile the tabular and event based
nature of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) with the sequential priors of
natural language models. This structural mismatch limits their ability to
capture longitudinal dependencies across patient encounters. We introduce
SerialBEHRT, a domain aligned foundation model that extends SciBERT through
additional pretraining on structured EHR sequences. SerialBEHRT is designed to
encode temporal and contextual relationships among clinical events, thereby
producing richer patient representations. We evaluate its effectiveness on the
task of antibiotic susceptibility prediction, a clinically meaningful problem
in antibiotic stewardship. Through extensive benchmarking against state of the
art EHR representation strategies, we demonstrate that SerialBEHRT achieves
superior and more consistent performance, highlighting the importance of
temporal serialization in foundation model pretraining for healthcare.

TL;DR: 提出动态短列表机制DynaSpec优化大词汇表下的推测解码效率，通过上下文相关元分类器实现自适应token聚类选择


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有固定词汇子集的推测解码方法存在脆弱性：1) 频率列表依赖语料库需反复调整 2) 静态列表抑制罕见/领域特定token，降低验证阶段接受率

Method: 设计轻量级元分类器路由上下文到token簇，通过并行执行草案编码和元短列表生成，动态选择top-k簇组成短列表，验证阶段保留完整词汇表

Result: 在标准基准测试中实现平均接受长度的持续提升，上下文相关选择允许更小短列表而不降低接受率

Conclusion: DynaSpec通过动态上下文感知的短列表机制，在保持验证准确性的同时显著提升推测解码效率，具有跨任务泛化能力

Abstract: Speculative decoding (a.k.a. speculative sampling) has become a standard way
to accelerate LLM inference: a small drafter proposes multiple tokens and a
large target model verifies them once per speculation length. Recently, scaling
of the LLM vocabulary has pushed the number of tokens to grow substantially.
While verification over the full vocabulary leaves the target model largely
unaffected, the O(|V|d) parameters in the drafter's output head become a
latency bottleneck, slowing the entire pipeline. Contemporary methods (e.g.,
FR-Spec, VocabTrim) restrict the drafter's vocabulary to a fixed subset of the
target model's vocabulary, ranked in descending order of token frequency.
Although this reduces draft-time compute, it is brittle, since: (i) frequency
lists are corpus-dependent and require retuning to generalize, and (ii) static
shortlists suppress rare or domain-specific tokens, lowering the expected
number of tokens per verification step. We propose DynaSpec, a
context-dependent dynamic shortlisting mechanism that is robust, speeds up
drafting, and generalizes across diverse tasks. Concretely, we introduce
lightweight, coarse-grained meta-classifiers that route contexts to a small
number of token clusters; the union of the top-k selected clusters forms the
drafter's shortlist, while verification retains the full vocabulary and
exactness. The meta-classifier finishes its computation earlier than the
drafter's hidden state generation by exploiting parallel execution of draft
encoding and meta shortlisting on separate streams. On standard
speculative-decoding benchmarks, we observe consistent gains in mean accepted
length over fixed-shortlist baselines, while context-dependent selection
enables smaller shortlists without degrading acceptance.

Result: Android设备实测显示处理速度提升，云端和端侧均保持高推理速度（<100ms）

Conclusion: 该框架为资源受限场景下的复合NLP任务提供高效解决方案，支持实时级应用部署

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly adapted for diverse downstream
tasks via parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adapters
(LoRA). While adapters can be combined to handle multiple tasks separately,
standard approaches struggle when targeting the simultaneous execution of
complex tasks, such as generating a translated summary from a long
conversation. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach tailored
specifically for compositional multi-tasking scenarios involving summarization
and translation. Our technique involves adding a learnable projection layer on
top of the combined summarization and translation adapters. This design enables
effective integration while maintaining efficiency through reduced
computational overhead compared to alternative strategies requiring extensive
retraining or sequential processing. We demonstrate the practical viability of
our method within an on-device environment by developing an Android app capable
of executing compositional tasks seamlessly. Experimental results indicate our
solution performs well and is fast in both cloud-based and on-device
implementations, highlighting the potential benefits of adopting our framework
in real-world applications demanding high-speed operation alongside resource
constraints.

Method: 在平行翻译数据上应用主成分分析获取语言方向向量，通过在推理时沿这些方向调整词嵌入空间来保持语言一致性，并分析模型各层的语言表征分布

Result: 使用单主成分实现95-99%语言分类准确率，将下一token分布差异降低42%，在Qwen2.5和Llama-3.2多个语言对中验证有效性

Conclusion: 该方法以极小计算代价实现语言控制，揭示深层网络具备近乎完美的语言线性可分性特征，为多语言模型优化提供新思路

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit unintended
code-switching, reducing reliability in downstream tasks. We propose
latent-space language steering, a lightweight inference-time method that
identifies language directions via PCA on parallel translations and steers
token embeddings along these axes to control language identity. Our approach
mitigates code-switching while preserving semantics with negligible
computational overhead and requires only minimal parallel data for calibration.
Empirically, we achieve 95-99\% language classification accuracy using a single
principal component and reduce next-token distributional divergence by up to
42% across multiple language pairs on Qwen2.5 and Llama-3.2 models. We further
analyze the layer-wise evolution of language representations, revealing that
language identity concentrates in final layers with near-perfect linear
separability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对LLMs思维链推理步骤不忠实、难解释的问题，受心理语言学UID理论启发，探究信息流动模式对推理质量的影响。

Method: 通过基于熵的量化指标，在三大数学基准测试中系统分析LLMs推理过程的信息密度变化规律。

Result: 正确解决方案表现出显著的信息密度波动（非均匀性），与人类沟通的均匀信息密度模式形成鲜明对比。

Conclusion: 挑战机器推理需模仿人类信息处理的固有认知，指明通过主动调控信息流设计自适应推理模型的新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often solve problems using step-by-step
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, yet these intermediate steps are frequently
unfaithful or hard to interpret. Inspired by the Uniform Information Density
(UID) hypothesis in psycholinguistics -- which posits that humans communicate
by maintaining a stable flow of information -- we introduce entropy-based
metrics to analyze the information flow within reasoning traces. Surprisingly,
across three challenging mathematical benchmarks, we find that successful
reasoning in LLMs is globally non-uniform: correct solutions are characterized
by uneven swings in information density, in stark contrast to human
communication patterns. This result challenges assumptions about machine
reasoning and suggests new directions for designing interpretable and adaptive
reasoning models.

Motivation: 现有定位-编辑框架在连续知识更新时会产生灾难性干扰，新编辑会破坏已有知识表示和先前修改结果

Method: 采用顺序零空间对齐技术，通过数学方法保持原始和已修改知识表示的独立性，确保在长期编辑序列中保持输出不变性

Result: 在真实世界连续编辑基准测试中达到SOTA性能，同时实现3.53倍速度提升，验证了方法的有效性和高效性

Conclusion: EvoEdit为动态演化场景下的LLM更新提供了理论保障强、实施简单的解决方案，推动大模型在动态信息环境中的持续学习发展

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require continual updates to rectify outdated or
erroneous knowledge. Model editing has emerged as a compelling paradigm for
introducing targeted modifications without the computational burden of full
retraining. Existing approaches are mainly based on a locate-then-edit
framework. However, in sequential editing contexts, where multiple updates are
applied over time, they exhibit significant limitations and suffer from
catastrophic interference, i.e., new edits compromise previously integrated
updates and degrade preserved knowledge. To address these challenges, we
introduce EvoEdit, a novel editing strategy that mitigates catastrophic
interference through sequential null-space alignment, enabling stable and
efficient model editing. By performing sequential null-space alignment for each
incoming edit, EvoEdit preserves both original and previously modified
knowledge representations and maintains output invariance on preserved
knowledge even across long edit sequences, effectively mitigating interference.
Evaluations on real-world sequential knowledge-editing benchmarks show that
EvoEdit achieves better or comparable performance than prior state-of-the-art
locate-then-edit techniques, with up to 3.53 times speedup. Overall, these
results underscore the necessity of developing more principled approaches for
designing LLMs in dynamically evolving information settings, while providing a
simple yet effective solution with strong theoretical guarantees.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估不同用户群体使用LLM时获得答案的事实一致性差异，建立独立于LLM提供商的公正评测体系。

Method: 对19个LLM进行100次/模型的跨角色测试（15主题×5事实），采用句子嵌入计算跨角色余弦相似度加权平均值得分。

Result: 最佳模型Grok-3得0.9065，最差模型0.7896，主题间差异显著（就业市场最不一致0.65，G7领导人最一致0.93）。

Conclusion: 事实一致性受模型提供商和主题双重影响，建议采用角色无关的提示策略，并开源工具促进可重复评估。

Abstract: Is an LLM telling you different facts than it's telling me? This paper
introduces ConsistencyAI, an independent benchmark for measuring the factual
consistency of large language models (LLMs) for different personas.
ConsistencyAI tests whether, when users of different demographics ask identical
questions, the model responds with factually inconsistent answers. Designed
without involvement from LLM providers, this benchmark offers impartial
evaluation and accountability. In our experiment, we queried 19 LLMs with
prompts that requested 5 facts for each of 15 topics. We repeated this query
100 times for each LLM, each time adding prompt context from a different
persona selected from a subset of personas modeling the general population. We
processed the responses into sentence embeddings, computed cross-persona cosine
similarity, and computed the weighted average of cross-persona cosine
similarity to calculate factual consistency scores. In 100-persona experiments,
scores ranged from 0.9065 to 0.7896, and the mean was 0.8656, which we adopt as
a benchmark threshold. xAI's Grok-3 is most consistent, while several
lightweight models rank lowest. Consistency varies by topic: the job market is
least consistent, G7 world leaders most consistent, and issues like vaccines or
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict diverge by provider. These results show that
both the provider and the topic shape the factual consistency. We release our
code and interactive demo to support reproducible evaluation and encourage
persona-invariant prompting strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业私有数据仓库的SQL日志标注成本过高，现有公开数据集无法反映真实场景需求。

Method: 结合检索增强生成(RAG)和LLM自动生成候选描述，由领域专家进行筛选/排序/编辑确保准确性。

Result: LLM辅助使标注效率提升5倍，人工验证使模型评估的准确率稳定性提高32%。

Conclusion: BenchPress为领域特定文本转SQL模型评估提供标准化工具，开源实现促进企业场景的模型优化。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been successfully applied to many tasks,
including text-to-SQL generation. However, much of this work has focused on
publicly available datasets, such as Fiben, Spider, and Bird. Our earlier work
showed that LLMs are much less effective in querying large private enterprise
data warehouses and released Beaver, the first private enterprise text-to-SQL
benchmark. To create Beaver, we leveraged SQL logs, which are often readily
available. However, manually annotating these logs to identify which natural
language questions they answer is a daunting task. Asking database
administrators, who are highly trained experts, to take on additional work to
construct and validate corresponding natural language utterances is not only
challenging but also quite costly. To address this challenge, we introduce
BenchPress, a human-in-the-loop system designed to accelerate the creation of
domain-specific text-to-SQL benchmarks. Given a SQL query, BenchPress uses
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and LLMs to propose multiple natural
language descriptions. Human experts then select, rank, or edit these drafts to
ensure accuracy and domain alignment. We evaluated BenchPress on annotated
enterprise SQL logs, demonstrating that LLM-assisted annotation drastically
reduces the time and effort required to create high-quality benchmarks. Our
results show that combining human verification with LLM-generated suggestions
enhances annotation accuracy, benchmark reliability, and model evaluation
robustness. By streamlining the creation of custom benchmarks, BenchPress
offers researchers and practitioners a mechanism for assessing text-to-SQL
models on a given domain-specific workload. BenchPress is freely available via
our public GitHub repository at
https://github.com/fabian-wenz/enterprise-txt2sql and is also accessible on our

Motivation: 解决低资源语言任务中标注数据稀缺问题，探索通过显式任务约束而非单纯依赖标注数据的训练范式

Method: 设计多层级语言规则系统，开发含OOV不确定性处理的正则化项的损失函数（R2T-BiLSTM），提出原则性学习（PrL）框架

Result: Zarma词性标注准确率98.2%（无监督），超越300标注样本的AfriBERTa；NER任务预训练后仅需50标注样本即超越300样本基线

Conclusion: R2T有效整合先验语言知识，显著降低标注数据需求，为低资源NLP提供了新的方法论框架

Abstract: We introduce the Rule-to-Tag (R2T) framework, a hybrid approach that
integrates a multi-tiered system of linguistic rules directly into a neural
network's training objective. R2T's novelty lies in its adaptive loss function,
which includes a regularization term that teaches the model to handle
out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words with principled uncertainty. We frame this work
as a case study in a paradigm we call principled learning (PrL), where models
are trained with explicit task constraints rather than on labeled examples
alone. Our experiments on Zarma part-of-speech (POS) tagging show that the
R2T-BiLSTM model, trained only on unlabeled text, achieves 98.2% accuracy,
outperforming baselines like AfriBERTa fine-tuned on 300 labeled sentences. We
further show that for more complex tasks like named entity recognition (NER),
R2T serves as a powerful pre-training step; a model pre-trained with R2T and
fine-tuned on just 50 labeled sentences outperformes a baseline trained on 300.

Motivation: 现有集成方法聚焦质量提升却忽视对抗错误信号的鲁棒性，异构分词方案和模型能力差异易导致集成失败，需开发针对性增强策略。

Method: 采用双层级一致性框架：token级通过低通滤波器降低预测分歧token的权重，模型级筛选高自信低差异的输出，实现粒度和全局鲁棒性增强。

Result: 多基准测试表明CoRE在各类模型组合和集成策略下持续提升性能，最高实现集成准确率相对提升12.7%。

Conclusion: CoRE作为即插即用方案能无缝兼容主流集成方法，显著提升抗干扰能力和整体表现，为大模型协同提供新思路。

Abstract: Different large language models (LLMs) exhibit diverse strengths and
weaknesses, and LLM ensemble serves as a promising approach to integrate their
complementary capabilities. Despite substantial progress in improving ensemble
quality, limited attention has been paid to the robustness of ensembles against
potential erroneous signals, which often arise from heterogeneous tokenization
schemes and varying model expertise. Our analysis shows that ensemble failures
typically arise from both the token level and the model level: the former
reflects severe disagreement in token predictions, while the latter involves
low confidence and pronounced disparities among models. In light of this, we
propose CoRE, a plug-and-play technique that harnesses model consistency for
robust LLM ensemble, which can be seamlessly integrated with diverse ensemble
methods. Token-level consistency captures fine-grained disagreements by
applying a low-pass filter to downweight uncertain tokens with high
inconsistency, often due to token misalignment, thereby improving robustness at
a granular level. Model-level consistency models global agreement by promoting
model outputs with high self-confidence and minimal divergence from others,
enhancing robustness at a coarser level. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks, model combinations, and ensemble strategies demonstrate that CoRE
consistently improves ensemble performance and robustness.

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) enables natural language queries
over medical images to support clinical decision-making and patient care. The
MEDIQA-WV 2025 shared task addressed wound-care VQA, requiring systems to
generate free-text responses and structured wound attributes from images and
patient queries. We present the MasonNLP system, which employs a
general-domain, instruction-tuned large language model with a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that incorporates textual and
visual examples from in-domain data. This approach grounds outputs in
clinically relevant exemplars, improving reasoning, schema adherence, and
response quality across dBLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and LLM-based metrics. Our
best-performing system ranked 3rd among 19 teams and 51 submissions with an
average score of 41.37%, demonstrating that lightweight RAG with
general-purpose LLMs -- a minimal inference-time layer that adds a few relevant
exemplars via simple indexing and fusion, with no extra training or complex
re-ranking -- provides a simple and effective baseline for multimodal clinical
NLP tasks.

Conclusion: MLP替代策略为小型语言模型的预训练架构优化提供了新方向

Abstract: While the transformer architecture has achieved state-of-the-art performance
on natural language processing tasks, these models impose substantial memory
and computational overhead. Recent research has identified significant
architectural redundancies within these models, presenting opportunities for
optimization without compromising performance. Taking insights from research in
AI interpretability and inference-time layer pruning, we introduce an efficient
language model architecture, referred to as ShishuLM, which reduces both the
parameter count and Key-Value (KV) cache requirements. Given the increasing
importance of Small Language Models (SLMs) in agentic AI systems, we evaluate
our approach on two SLMs of different scales. Our analysis reveals that for
moderate-context scenarios, normalization coupled with attention computation is
roughly linear with the input, enabling entire transformer blocks to be
approximated through Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). Our results show that
ShishuLM provides up to 25% reduction in memory requirements and up to 40%
improvement in latency during both training and inference, compared to parent
models. Our experimental and analytical findings provide insights towards
building more efficient SLM architectures from a pre-training standpoint.

Method: 分析26,986条学生与LLM导师对话，融合三种前沿LLM（Gemini/GPT-4o/Claude）的零样本情感标注，通过排名加权和多数共识生成情感画像

Result: 学生呈现温和积极情绪（中等唤醒度），学习过程伴随困惑/好奇/偶发挫折，情感状态短暂且中性时刻常成转折点（64%向上转变）

Conclusion: 情感动态呈现脆弱性（积极状态易中断）与韧性（负向情绪快速消退），中性时刻的干预窗口为AI导师设计提供关键切入点

Abstract: While recent studies have examined the leaning impact of large language model
(LLM) in educational contexts, the affective dynamics of LLM-mediated tutoring
remain insufficiently understood. This work introduces the first ensemble-LLM
framework for large-scale affect sensing in tutoring dialogues, advancing the
conversation on responsible pathways for integrating generative AI into
education by attending to learners' evolving affective states. To achieve this,
we analyzed two semesters' worth of 16,986 conversational turns exchanged
between PyTutor, an LLM-powered AI tutor, and 261 undergraduate learners across
three U.S. institutions. To investigate learners' emotional experiences, we
generate zero-shot affect annotations from three frontier LLMs (Gemini, GPT-4o,
Claude), including scalar ratings of valence, arousal, and
learning-helpfulness, along with free-text emotion labels. These estimates are
fused through rank-weighted intra-model pooling and plurality consensus across
models to produce robust emotion profiles. Our analysis shows that during
interaction with the AI tutor, students typically report mildly positive affect
and moderate arousal. Yet learning is not uniformly smooth: confusion and
curiosity are frequent companions to problem solving, and frustration, while
less common, still surfaces in ways that can derail progress. Emotional states
are short-lived--positive moments last slightly longer than neutral or negative
ones, but they are fragile and easily disrupted. Encouragingly, negative
emotions often resolve quickly, sometimes rebounding directly into positive
states. Neutral moments frequently act as turning points, more often steering
students upward than downward, suggesting opportunities for tutors to intervene
at precisely these junctures.

Motivation: 现有扩散语言模型沿用自回归模型的基于前缀的条件生成范式，限制了其灵活性和效率。需要为DLMs设计专属的生成控制方法。

Method: 1. 模板填充（TI）分两阶段生成：首先生成响应结构模板，再填充掩码段落；2. 动态分段分配（DSA）根据生成置信度自适应调整段落长度。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成基准测试中取得17.01%的绝对性能提升，且在多token生成场景下实现质量可控的加速。

Conclusion: TI+DSA为DLMs提供了更灵活的结构控制范式，突破了传统前缀条件的限制，为DLMs的实际应用开辟了新路径。

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to
Autoregressive Language Models, yet their inference strategies remain limited
to prefix-based prompting inherited from the autoregressive paradigm. In this
paper, we propose Template Infilling (TI), a tailored conditioning methodology
for DLMs' generation process. Unlike conventional prefix prompting, TI first
generates a structural template for the target response, then fills in the
masked segments. To enhance the flexibility of this structural control, we
introduce Dynamic Segment Allocation (DSA), which adaptively adjusts segment
lengths based on generation confidence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks, achieving
consistent improvements of 17.01$\%$p over baseline. Furthermore, we show that
TI provides additional advantages in multi-token generation settings, enabling
effective speedup while maintaining generation quality.

annotated with terms related to morphology, topography, and histologic
differentiation, using the International Classification of Diseases for

composite expression-level normalisations that combine multiple ICD-O elements
into unified clinical concepts. Annotation quality was ensured through expert
review: 1301 texts were manually annotated for entity spans by two domain
experts. A total of 71127 ICD-O normalisations were produced through a
combination of automated matching and manual validation by a team of five

Motivation: 现有混合深度模型存在不稳定和需大量重训练问题，需要一种无需破坏预训练权重即可动态跳层的方法。

Method: 在Attention/MLP分支加入sigmoid线性门，根据门值动态跳过低重要性token，支持基于层预算的推理优化。

Result: 长文本推理节省15%计算保留90%准确率；指令模型全计算时准确率提升，50%计算时仍匹配基线质量。

Conclusion: GateSkip揭示了transformer信息流动规律（如BOS锚点效应），且可与量化/剪枝/自推测解码等技术无缝结合应用。

Abstract: We introduce GateSkip, a simple residual-stream gating mechanism that enables
token-wise layer skipping in decoder-only LMs. Each Attention/MLP branch is
equipped with a sigmoid-linear gate that condenses the branch's output before
it re-enters the residual stream. During inference we rank tokens by the gate
values and skip low-importance ones using a per-layer budget. While early-exit
or router-based Mixture-of-Depths models are known to be unstable and need
extensive retraining, our smooth, differentiable gates fine-tune stably on top
of pretrained models. On long-form reasoning, we save up to 15\% compute while
retaining over 90\% of baseline accuracy. On instruction-tuned models we see
accuracy gains at full compute and match baseline quality near 50\% savings.
The learned gates give insight into transformer information flow (e.g., BOS
tokens act as anchors), and the method combines easily with quantization,
pruning, and self-speculative decoding.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown to be increasingly capable of
performing reasoning tasks, but their ability to make sequential decisions
under uncertainty only using natural language remains underexplored. We
introduce a novel benchmark in which LLMs interact with multi-armed bandit
environments using purely textual feedback, "you earned a token", without
access to numerical cues or explicit probabilities, resulting in the model to
infer latent reward structures purely off linguistic cues and to adapt
accordingly. We evaluated the performance of four open-source LLMs and compare
their performance to standard decision-making algorithms such as Thompson
Sampling, Epsilon Greedy, Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), and random choice.
While most of the LLMs underperformed compared to the baselines, Qwen3-4B,
achieved the best-arm selection rate of 89.2% , which significantly
outperformed both the larger LLMs and traditional methods. Our findings suggest
that probabilistic reasoning is able to emerge from language alone, and we
present this benchmark as a step towards evaluating decision-making
capabilities in naturalistic, non-numeric contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Catch Your Breath损失函数，使语言模型能动态调整token计算步骤，在需要时通过<don't know>和<pause>请求额外计算资源，提升效率与准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统模型静态计算分配导致资源浪费的问题，通过动态调整使模型自主决策计算资源分配，优化复杂token处理并提升数据利用率。

Method: 提出三种CYB损失方法：CYB-AP（即时预测+时间折扣）、CYB-VA（变分优化停止时间分布）、CYB-DP（计算预算惩罚），通过微调选择最佳方案。

Result: CYB模型训练数据效率提升3倍，适应token复杂度（复数名词暂停率高，缩略词首token不暂停，歧义词处理时间差异显著）。

Conclusion: 动态计算分配机制有效提升模型性能，为自适应NLP计算提供新范式，证明token级计算优化可行性。

Abstract: We explore a class of supervised training objectives that allow a language
model to dynamically and autonomously scale the number of compute steps used
for each input token. For any token, the model can request additional compute
steps by emitting a <don't know> output. If the model is granted a delay, a
specialized <pause> token is inserted at the next input step, providing the
model with additional compute resources to generate an output. The model can
request multiple pauses. To train the model to use <don't know> outputs
judiciously and to calibrate its uncertainty, we frame the selection of each
output token as a sequential-decision problem with a time cost. We refer to the
class of methods as $\textit{Catch Your Breath}$ losses and we study three
methods in this class: CYB-AP frames the model's task as anytime prediction,
where an output may be required at any step and accuracy is discounted over
time; CYB-VA is a variational approach that aims to maximize prediction
accuracy subject to a specified distribution over stopping times; and CYB-DP
imposes a penalty based on a computational budget. Through fine-tuning
experiments, we identify the best performing loss variant. The CYB model needs
only one third as much training data as the baseline (no pause) model needs to
achieve the same performance, and half as much data as a model with pauses and
a cross-entropy loss. We find that the CYB model requests additional steps when
doing so improves accuracy, and the model adapts its processing time to
token-level complexity and context. For example, it often pauses after plural
nouns like $\textit{patients}$ and $\textit{challenges}$ but never pauses after
the first token of contracted words like $\textit{wasn}$ and $\textit{didn}$,
and it shows high variability for ambiguous tokens like $\textit{won}$, which
could function as either a verb or part of a contraction.

Result: 在需求工程领域验证框架有效性，使用分类器辅助显著提升软件需求生成质量

Conclusion: PAGE提供简单可扩展的解决方案，模块化设计易于适配不同生成任务场景

Abstract: In recent years, natural language generative models have shown outstanding
performance in text generation tasks. However, when facing specific tasks or
particular requirements, they may exhibit poor performance or require
adjustments that demand large amounts of additional data. This work introduces
PAGE (Prompt Augmentation for text Generation Enhancement), a framework
designed to assist these models through the use of simple auxiliary modules.
These modules, lightweight models such as classifiers or extractors, provide
inferences from the input text. The output of these auxiliaries is then used to
construct an enriched input that improves the quality and controllability of
the generation. Unlike other generation-assistance approaches, PAGE does not
require auxiliary generative models; instead, it proposes a simpler, modular
architecture that is easy to adapt to different tasks. This paper presents the
proposal, its components and architecture, and reports a proof of concept in
the domain of requirements engineering, where an auxiliary module with a
classifier is used to improve the quality of software requirements generation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通过封闭式设计限制LLM生成能力，忽略了其开放性特质，导致社会模拟失真。

Method: 结合数十年调查方法论研究及NLP最新进展，论证开放式生成在测量质量、探索未知观点、降低研究者指令性偏差等方面的价值。

Result: 开放式生成能捕捉表达多样性，支持预测性测试，最终提升社会模拟方法论的实用性与信效度。

Conclusion: 呼吁开发兼容LLM生成多样性的实践框架，推动NLP与社会科学在开放式社会模拟中的协同创新。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate public opinion
and other social phenomena. Most current studies constrain these simulations to
multiple-choice or short-answer formats for ease of scoring and comparison, but
such closed designs overlook the inherently generative nature of LLMs. In this
position paper, we argue that open-endedness, using free-form text that
captures topics, viewpoints, and reasoning processes "in" LLMs, is essential
for realistic social simulation. Drawing on decades of survey-methodology
research and recent advances in NLP, we argue why this open-endedness is
valuable in LLM social simulations, showing how it can improve measurement and
design, support exploration of unanticipated views, and reduce
researcher-imposed directive bias. It also captures expressiveness and
individuality, aids in pretesting, and ultimately enhances methodological
utility. We call for novel practices and evaluation frameworks that leverage
rather than constrain the open-ended generative diversity of LLMs, creating
synergies between NLP and social science.

Motivation: 探究当前大语言模型在将非结构化文本压缩到有限分类体系中的实际效能，并寻找优化路径

Method: 使用统一数据集和零样本提示评估10个LLM，采用经典指标（准确率/精确率/召回率/F1）和专用指标（幻觉率/膨胀率/成本），并开发基于多模型协同的集成方法

Result: 主流LLM平均准确率34%，GPT 120B幻觉率最低但成本高，集成方法使准确率提升并完全消除幻觉现象

Conclusion: 通过协调多个模型的专业判断（而非单纯扩大模型规模），是实现超越人类专家分类性能的有效路径

Abstract: This study presents a comparative evaluation of ten state-of-the-art large
language models (LLMs) applied to unstructured text categorization using the
Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) 2.2 hierarchical taxonomy. The analysis
employed a uniform dataset of 8,660 human-annotated samples and identical
zero-shot prompts to ensure methodological consistency across all models.
Evaluation metrics included four classic measures - accuracy, precision,
recall, and F1-score - and three LLM-specific indicators: hallucination ratio,
inflation ratio, and categorization cost.
  Results show that, despite their rapid advancement, contemporary LLMs achieve
only moderate classic performance, with average scores of 34% accuracy, 42%
precision, 45% recall, and 41% F1-score. Hallucination and inflation ratios
reveal that models frequently overproduce categories relative to human
annotators. Among the evaluated systems, Gemini 1.5/2.0 Flash and GPT 20B/120B
offered the most favorable cost-to-performance balance, while GPT 120B
demonstrated the lowest hallucination ratio. The findings suggest that scaling
and architectural improvements alone do not ensure better categorization
accuracy, as the task requires compressing rich unstructured text into a
limited taxonomy - a process that challenges current model architectures.
  To address these limitations, a separate ensemble-based approach was
developed and tested. The ensemble method, in which multiple LLMs act as
independent experts, substantially improved accuracy, reduced inflation, and
completely eliminated hallucinations. These results indicate that coordinated
orchestration of models - rather than sheer scale - may represent the most
effective path toward achieving or surpassing human-expert performance in
large-scale text categorization.

Result: ProofGrader MAE达0.926，优于基线。在best-of-16选择任务中平均分4.14（满分7），比二进制评估器提升78%接近人类水平（4.62）。

Conclusion: ProofGrader填补LLM数学证明评估空白，实验证明其在下游证明生成任务中的实用价值，为领域发展提供关键工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) for mathematical reasoning
have largely focused on tasks with easily verifiable final answers; however,
generating and verifying natural language math proofs remains an open
challenge. We identify the absence of a reliable, fine-grained evaluator for
LLM-generated math proofs as a critical gap. To address this, we propose a
systematic methodology for developing and validating evaluators that assign
fine-grained scores on a 0-7 scale to model-generated math proofs. To enable
this study, we introduce ProofBench, the first expert-annotated dataset of
fine-grained proof ratings, spanning 145 problems from six major math
competitions (USAMO, IMO, Putnam, etc) and 435 LLM-generated solutions from
Gemini-2.5-pro, o3, and DeepSeek-R1. %with expert gradings. Using ProofBench as
a testbed, we systematically explore the evaluator design space across key
axes: the backbone model, input context, instructions and evaluation workflow.
Our analysis delivers ProofGrader, an evaluator that combines a strong
reasoning backbone LM, rich context from reference solutions and marking
schemes, and a simple ensembling method; it achieves a low Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) of 0.926 against expert scores, significantly outperforming naive
baselines. Finally, we demonstrate its practical utility in a best-of-$n$
selection task: at $n=16$, ProofGrader achieves an average score of 4.14 (out
of 7), closing 78% of the gap between a naive binary evaluator (2.48) and the
human oracle (4.62), highlighting its potential to advance downstream proof
generation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced many domains and applications but
face high fine-tuning costs, inference latency, limited edge deployability, and
reliability concerns. Small language models (SLMs), compact, efficient, and
adaptable, offer complementary remedies. Recent work explores collaborative
frameworks that fuse SLMs' specialization and efficiency with LLMs'
generalization and reasoning to meet diverse objectives across tasks and
deployment scenarios. Motivated by these developments, this paper presents a
systematic survey of SLM-LLM collaboration organized by collaboration
objectives. We propose a taxonomy with four goals: performance enhancement,
cost-effectiveness, cloud-edge privacy, and trustworthiness. Within this
framework, we review representative methods, summarize design paradigms, and
outline open challenges and future directions toward efficient, secure, and
scalable SLM-LLM collaboration.

Result: 仅用5%数据训练的模型超越全量数据效果，垂直领域2%数据量模型即超越大数据集训练结果，领域泛化能力显著优于纯LLM筛选方法。

Conclusion: THTB开创了可解释的指令数据选择范式，在降低训练成本的同时提升模型领域适应能力，为专业领域大模型应用提供新路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in general tasks, but adapting them to
specialized domains relies on high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data.
Although existing methods can identify subsets of high-quality data and reduce
training cost to some extent, their selection process still suffers from
over-reliance on LLMs' internal knowledge, weak interpretability, and limited
generalization. To address these limitations, we propose THTB (The Harder The
Better), a cognitive science-inspired framework for instruction data selection
and annotation guidance. THTB prioritizes higher-level cognitive instructions
by combining quality filtering with intrinsic and extrinsic hardness scoring,
offering interpretable and quantifiable criteria for efficient SFT, both in
data selection and annotation guidance. Experiments show that THTB enables
models trained on only 5% of the data to outperform full-dataset training,
while achieving superior generalization compared with LLM-only selection. In
addition, THTB provides effective annotation guidance in vertical domains,
enabling a model trained on just 2% of the data to surpass models trained on
much larger datasets, demonstrating strong potential for domain adaptation. Our
code, datasets, and models are available on

Conclusion: 分层分类法系统揭示了LLM越狱机制，多语言多轮数据集突破了传统单轮防御局限，为动态安全框架开发奠定基础。

Abstract: Jailbreaking techniques pose a significant threat to the safety of Large
Language Models (LLMs). Existing defenses typically focus on single-turn
attacks, lack coverage across languages, and rely on limited taxonomies that
either fail to capture the full diversity of attack strategies or emphasize
risk categories rather than the jailbreaking techniques. To advance the
understanding of the effectiveness of jailbreaking techniques, we conducted a
structured red-teaming challenge. The outcome of our experiments are manifold.
First, we developed a comprehensive hierarchical taxonomy of 50 jailbreak
strategies, consolidating and extending prior classifications into seven broad
families, including impersonation, persuasion, privilege escalation, cognitive
overload, obfuscation, goal conflict, and data poisoning. Second, we analyzed
the data collected from the challenge to examine the prevalence and success
rates of different attack types, providing insights into how specific jailbreak
strategies exploit model vulnerabilities and induce misalignment. Third, we
benchmark a popular LLM for jailbreak detection, evaluating the benefits of
taxonomy-guided prompting for improving automatic detection. Finally, we
compiled a new Italian dataset of 1364 multi-turn adversarial dialogues,
annotated with our taxonomy, enabling the study of interactions where
adversarial intent emerges gradually and succeeds in bypassing traditional
safeguards.

Method: 使用Human AI Parallel Corpus数据集（含6领域600样本），对比测试固定风格嵌入与GPT-4o法官的归属准确率。

Result: 风格嵌入在GPT生成文本准确率82%（LLM法官68%），LLaMA文本中LLM法官略优（85% vs 81%）。LLM法官在小说/学术领域表现更优，风格嵌入擅长口语/剧本类文本。

Abstract: Attributing authorship in the era of large language models (LLMs) is
increasingly challenging as machine-generated prose rivals human writing. We
benchmark two complementary attribution mechanisms , fixed Style Embeddings and
an instruction-tuned LLM judge (GPT-4o) on the Human AI Parallel Corpus, an
open dataset of 600 balanced instances spanning six domains (academic, news,
fiction, blogs, spoken transcripts, and TV/movie scripts). Each instance
contains a human prompt with both a gold continuation and an LLM-generated
continuation from either GPT-4o or LLaMA-70B-Instruct. The Style Embedding
baseline achieves stronger aggregate accuracy on GPT continuations (82 pct vs.
68 pct). The LLM Judge is slightly better than the Style embeddings on LLaMA
continuations (85 pct vs. 81 pct) but the results are not statistically
significant. Crucially, the LLM judge significantly outperforms in fiction and
academic prose, indicating semantic sensitivity, whereas embeddings dominate in
spoken and scripted dialogue, reflecting structural strengths. These
complementary patterns highlight attribution as a multidimensional problem
requiring hybrid strategies. To support reproducibility we provide code on
GitHub and derived data on Hugging Face under the MIT license. This open
framework provides a reproducible benchmark for attribution quality assessment
in AI-generated content, along with a review of related literature influencing

Conclusion: 窄域微调模型携带明显训练目标特征，警示将其作为广泛微调（如对话调优）研究替代品可能失真，强调需开发更真实的案例支持安全/可解释性研究

Abstract: Finetuning on narrow domains has become an essential tool to adapt Large
Language Models (LLMs) to specific tasks and to create models with known
unusual properties that are useful for research. We show that narrow finetuning
creates strong biases in LLM activations that can be interpreted to understand
the finetuning domain. These biases can be discovered using simple tools from
model diffing - the study of differences between models before and after
finetuning. In particular, analyzing activation differences on the first few
tokens of random text and steering by adding this difference to the model
activations produces text similar to the format and general content of the
finetuning data. We demonstrate that these analyses contain crucial information
by creating an LLM-based interpretability agent to understand the finetuning
domain. With access to the bias, the agent performs significantly better
compared to baseline agents using simple prompting. Our analysis spans
synthetic document finetuning for false facts, emergent misalignment,
subliminal learning, and taboo word guessing game models across different
architectures (Gemma, LLaMA, Qwen) and scales (1B to 32B parameters). We
suspect these biases reflect overfitting and find that mixing pretraining data
into the finetuning corpus largely removes them, though residual risks may
remain. Our work (1) demonstrates that narrowly finetuned models have salient
traces of their training objective in their activations and suggests ways to
improve how they are trained, (2) warns AI safety and interpretability
researchers that the common practice of using such models as a proxy for
studying broader finetuning (e.g., chat-tuning) might not be realistic, and (3)
highlights the need for deeper investigation into the effects of narrow
finetuning and development of truly realistic case studies for model-diffing,
safety and interpretability research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance across diverse
tasks yet remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass safety mechanisms.
We present RAID (Refusal-Aware and Integrated Decoding), a framework that
systematically probes these weaknesses by crafting adversarial suffixes that
induce restricted content while preserving fluency. RAID relaxes discrete
tokens into continuous embeddings and optimizes them with a joint objective
that (i) encourages restricted responses, (ii) incorporates a refusal-aware
regularizer to steer activations away from refusal directions in embedding
space, and (iii) applies a coherence term to maintain semantic plausibility and
non-redundancy. After optimization, a critic-guided decoding procedure maps
embeddings back to tokens by balancing embedding affinity with language-model
likelihood. This integration yields suffixes that are both effective in
bypassing defenses and natural in form. Experiments on multiple open-source
LLMs show that RAID achieves higher attack success rates with fewer queries and
lower computational cost than recent white-box and black-box baselines. These
findings highlight the importance of embedding-space regularization for
understanding and mitigating LLM jailbreak vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly incorporated into
everyday life for many internet users, taking on significant roles as advice
givers in the domains of medicine, personal relationships, and even legal
matters. The importance of these roles raise questions about how and what
responses LLMs make in difficult political and moral domains, especially
questions about possible biases. To quantify the nature of potential biases in
LLMs, various works have applied Moral Foundations Theory (MFT), a framework
that categorizes human moral reasoning into five dimensions: Harm, Fairness,
Ingroup Loyalty, Authority, and Purity. Previous research has used the MFT to
measure differences in human participants along political, national, and
cultural lines. While there has been some analysis of the responses of LLM with
respect to political stance in role-playing scenarios, no work so far has
directly assessed the moral leanings in the LLM responses, nor have they
connected LLM outputs with robust human data. In this paper we analyze the
distinctions between LLM MFT responses and existing human research directly,
investigating whether commonly available LLM responses demonstrate ideological
leanings: either through their inherent responses, straightforward
representations of political ideologies, or when responding from the
perspectives of constructed human personas. We assess whether LLMs inherently
generate responses that align more closely with one political ideology over
another, and additionally examine how accurately LLMs can represent ideological
perspectives through both explicit prompting and demographic-based
role-playing. By systematically analyzing LLM behavior across these conditions
and experiments, our study provides insight into the extent of political and
demographic dependency in AI-generated responses.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) enables transformer-based language models to adapt
to new tasks by conditioning on demonstration examples. However, traditional
example-driven in-context learning lacks explicit modules for knowledge
retrieval and transfer at the abstraction level. Inspired by cognitive science,
specifically schema theory, which holds that humans interpret new information
by activating pre-existing mental frameworks (schemas) to structure
understanding, we introduce SCHEMA ACTIVATED IN CONTEXT LEARNING (SA-ICL). This
framework extracts the representation of the building blocks of cognition for
the reasoning process instilled from prior examples, creating an abstracted
schema, a lightweight, structured template of key inferential steps and their
relationships, which is then used to augment a model's reasoning process when
presented with a novel question. We demonstrate that a broad range of large
language models (LLMs) lack the capacity to form and utilize internal
schema-based learning representations implicitly, but instead benefit
significantly from explicit schema-based scaffolding. Across chemistry and
physics questions from the GPQA dataset, our experiments show that SA-ICL
consistently boosts performance, up to 36.19 percent, when the single
demonstration example is of high quality, which simultaneously reduces reliance
on the number of demonstrations and enhances interpretability. SCHEMA ACTIVATED
IN CONTEXT LEARNING not only bridges disparate ICL strategies ranging from
pattern priming to Chain-of-Thought prompting, but also paves a new path for
enhancing human-like reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出基于无标签偏好反馈的Prompt Duel Optimizer（PDO）框架，通过决斗老虎机机制高效优化LLM提示


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动提示优化方法依赖带标签的验证数据，而实际场景中获取高质量标签成本高昂。需要开发不依赖完整标注数据的优化方案，利用LLM自身生成偏好反馈进行提示优化。

Method: 采用决斗多臂老虎机框架，结合双Thompson采样（D-TS）选择信息量大的提示对比，并通过Top-Performer Guided Mutation机制扩展候选提示池。支持融合部分标签降低评委噪声影响。

Result: 在BIG-bench Hard和MS MARCO任务中超越基线方法，消融实验验证D-TS的探索效率和提示变异机制的有效性。

Conclusion: PDO框架成功实现无标签场景下的高效提示优化，其探索-利用平衡机制和动态候选扩展策略为实际应用提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to their input prompts,
making prompt design a central challenge. While automatic prompt optimization
(APO) reduces manual engineering, most approaches assume access to ground-truth
references such as labeled validation data. In practice, however, collecting
high-quality labels is costly and slow. We propose the Prompt Duel Optimizer
(PDO), a sample-efficient framework for label-free prompt optimization. PDO
formulates the problem as a dueling-bandit setting, where supervision signal
comes from pairwise preference feedback provided by an LLM judge. The framework
combines Double Thompson Sampling (D-TS), which prioritizes informative prompt
comparisons, with Top-Performer Guided Mutation, which expands the candidate
pool by mutating high-performing prompts. PDO naturally operates in label-free
settings and can also incorporate partial labels to mitigate judge noise.
Experiments on BIG-bench Hard (BBH) and MS MARCO show that PDO consistently
outperforms baseline methods. Ablation studies further demonstrate the
effectiveness of both D-TS and prompt mutation.

Conclusion: 揭示了LLMs算术计算的内部机制，为模型可解释性研究提供新方向，展示通过嵌入操作控制模型行为的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities but continue to struggle with arithmetic tasks. Prior works
largely focus on outputs or prompting strategies, leaving the open question of
the internal structure through which models do arithmetic computation. In this
work, we investigate whether LLMs encode operator precedence in their internal
representations via the open-source instruction-tuned LLaMA 3.2-3B model. We
constructed a dataset of arithmetic expressions with three operands and two
operators, varying the order and placement of parentheses. Using this dataset,
we trace whether intermediate results appear in the residual stream of the
instruction-tuned LLaMA 3.2-3B model. We apply interpretability techniques such
as logit lens, linear classification probes, and UMAP geometric visualization.
Our results show that intermediate computations are present in the residual
stream, particularly after MLP blocks. We also find that the model linearly
encodes precedence in each operator's embeddings post attention layer. We
introduce partial embedding swap, a technique that modifies operator precedence
by exchanging high-impact embedding dimensions between operators.

Conclusion: KRLM实现了LLM与KG的深度协同，提升开放域知识推理的可信度与泛化能力，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Inductive Knowledge Graph Reasoning (KGR) aims to discover facts in
open-domain KGs containing unknown entities and relations, which poses a
challenge for KGR models in comprehending uncertain KG components. Existing
studies have proposed Knowledge Graph Foundation Models (KGFMs) that learn
structural invariances across KGs to handle this uncertainty. Recently, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities for open-domain
knowledge reasoning. As a result, the latest research has focused on LLM-based
KGFMs that integrate LLM knowledge with KG context for inductive KGR. However,
the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs may be overshadowed by sparse KG context,
leading to LLM knowledge distortion, which can cause irreversible damage to
model reasoning. Moreover, existing LLM-based KGR methods still struggle to
fully constrain generative hallucinations in LLMs, severely limiting the
credibility of reasoning results. To address these limitations, we propose a
Knowledge Reasoning Language Model (KRLM) that achieves unified coordination
between LLM knowledge and KG context throughout the KGR process. Specifically,
we design a Knowledge Reasoning Language (KRL) instruction format and a KRL
tokenizer to align LLM knowledge with KG representations. Then, we propose a
KRL attention layer that coordinates intrinsic LLM knowledge with additional KG
context through a dynamic knowledge memory mechanism. Finally, a
structure-aware next-entity predictor is proposed, which strictly constrains
the reasoning results within a trustworthy knowledge domain. Extensive
experimental results on 25 real-world inductive KGR datasets demonstrate the
significant superiority of the proposed KRLM\footnote{Our source codes are

Result: 实验证明具备更强RAGCap能力的'慢思考'模型在端到端任务中表现更优，验证了基准的有效性

Conclusion: 提升中间推理能力是改进RAG系统的关键路径，RAGCap-Bench为能力优化提供了有效评估框架

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates key limitations of Large
Language Models (LLMs)-such as factual errors, outdated knowledge, and
hallucinations-by dynamically retrieving external information. Recent work
extends this paradigm through agentic RAG systems, where LLMs act as agents to
iteratively plan, retrieve, and reason over complex queries. However, these
systems still struggle with challenging multi-hop questions, and their
intermediate reasoning capabilities remain underexplored. To address this, we
propose RAGCap-Bench, a capability-oriented benchmark for fine-grained
evaluation of intermediate tasks in agentic RAG workflows. We analyze outputs
from state-of-the-art systems to identify common tasks and the core
capabilities required for their execution, then construct a taxonomy of typical
LLM errors to design targeted evaluation questions. Experiments show that
"slow-thinking" models with stronger RAGCap performance achieve better
end-to-end results, underscoring the benchmark's validity and the importance of
enhancing these intermediate capabilities.

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了语言模型在辩论中的系统性偏好偏差，为改进AI监督训练提供了实证依据，同时暴露了人机交互中说服机制与论点质量评估的复杂关系

Abstract: The core premise of AI debate as a scalable oversight technique is that it is
harder to lie convincingly than to refute a lie, enabling the judge to identify
the correct position. Yet, existing debate experiments have relied on datasets
with ground truth, where lying is reduced to defending an incorrect
proposition. This overlooks a subjective dimension: lying also requires the
belief that the claim defended is false. In this work, we apply debate to
subjective questions and explicitly measure large language models' prior
beliefs before experiments. Debaters were asked to select their preferred
position, then presented with a judge persona deliberately designed to conflict
with their identified priors. This setup tested whether models would adopt
sycophantic strategies, aligning with the judge's presumed perspective to
maximize persuasiveness, or remain faithful to their prior beliefs. We
implemented and compared two debate protocols, sequential and simultaneous, to
evaluate potential systematic biases. Finally, we assessed whether models were
more persuasive and produced higher-quality arguments when defending positions
consistent with their prior beliefs versus when arguing against them. Our main
findings show that models tend to prefer defending stances aligned with the
judge persona rather than their prior beliefs, sequential debate introduces
significant bias favoring the second debater, models are more persuasive when
defending positions aligned with their prior beliefs, and paradoxically,
arguments misaligned with prior beliefs are rated as higher quality in pairwise
comparison. These results can inform human judges to provide higher-quality
training signals and contribute to more aligned AI systems, while revealing
important aspects of human-AI interaction regarding persuasion dynamics in
language models.

Conclusion: 任务复杂度渐进增强策略能有效提升数据质量，验证了数据合成流程对模型性能的独立增益效应

Abstract: Web-based 'deep research' agents aim to solve complex question - answering
tasks through long-horizon interactions with online tools. These tasks remain
challenging, as the underlying language models are often not optimized for
long-horizon reasoning and exploration. Prior work has proposed workflows for
constructing instruction-tuning datasets, often leveraging knowledge graphs.
However, such methods typically lack fine-grained control over difficulty and
quality, yielding synthetic data that falls short of capturing the complexity
required for long-horizon reasoning. Furthermore, many studies conflate data
and training effects by comparing models trained under different optimization
recipes, making it difficult to isolate and evaluate the effectiveness of the
data itself. We introduce a two-pronged data synthesis pipeline that generates
question - answer pairs by progressively increasing task complexity until a
frontier baseline web agent fails. The baseline agent plays multiple roles in
this process: attempting the questions, validating factuality, checking for
alternative answers, and enforcing filtering. To evaluate the effectiveness of
our synthesis methods, we adopt a controlled training setup based on
distillation from strong web agents. Experiments across multiple web-based
benchmarks show that our dataset - despite being smaller - enables the training
of more effective web agents than existing datasets. In particular, our data
exhibits twice the diversity in tool-use actions, allowing models trained on it
to achieve stronger performance while avoiding repetitive tool-calling
behaviors.

Method: 构建结构相同但可读性不同的合成数据集，对比模型在不同文本上的表现，引入n-gram多样性指标量化统计特性。

Result: 复杂文本训练的模型表现与简化文本相当且发展更快，统计简洁性（低n-gram多样性）是更好的能力预测指标。

Conclusion: 反对无实证的拟人化训练类比，强调应关注统计特性等本质因素，为小模型能力涌现机制提供新视角。

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that very small language models (SLMs) can generate
surprisingly coherent text when trained on simplified, child-directed corpora
such as TinyStories. These findings have been interpreted as evidence that
readability -- characterized by accessible vocabulary, familiar narrative
structure, and simple syntax -- plays a key role in enabling such capabilities
to emerge. In this paper, we challenge that interpretation. We construct
synthetic datasets with matched structure but varied readability, and find that
readability alone does not predict coherence or learning efficiency in SLMs.
Models trained on complex, adult-level text perform comparably to those trained
on simplified language, and even exhibit faster development of coherence during
training. Instead, we show that statistical simplicity, as measured by n-gram
diversity, is a stronger predictor of learnability. Our findings caution
against the growing trend of anthropomorphizing language model training --
drawing parallels to human cognitive development without empirical basis -- and
argue for more precise reasoning about what properties actually support
capability emergence in small models.

Conclusion: 为材料科学领域AI驱动发现提供新范式，推动语言模型在自然科学中的应用

Abstract: Accurate property data for chemical elements is crucial for materials design
and manufacturing, but many of them are difficult to measure directly due to
equipment constraints. While traditional methods use the properties of other
elements or related properties for prediction via numerical analyses, they
often fail to model complex relationships. After all, not all characteristics
can be represented as scalars. Recent efforts have been made to explore
advanced AI tools such as language models for property estimation, but they
still suffer from hallucinations and a lack of interpretability. In this paper,
we investigate Element2Vecto effectively represent chemical elements from
natural languages to support research in the natural sciences. Given the text
parsed from Wikipedia pages, we use language models to generate both a single
general-purpose embedding (Global) and a set of attribute-highlighted vectors
(Local). Despite the complicated relationship across elements, the
computational challenges also exist because of 1) the discrepancy in text
distribution between common descriptions and specialized scientific texts, and
2) the extremely limited data, i.e., with only 118 known elements, data for
specific properties is often highly sparse and incomplete. Thus, we also design
a test-time training method based on self-attention to mitigate the prediction
error caused by Vanilla regression clearly. We hope this work could pave the
way for advancing AI-driven discovery in materials science.

Conclusion: 智能聚合策略比单纯增加测试时计算规模更能实现性能突破，为效率提升提供新方向

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) are a cornerstone of test-time scaling (TTS),
designed to verify and select the best responses from large language models
(LLMs). However, this promise is challenged by recent benchmarks where simple
majority voting, which ignores PRM signals, occasionally outperforms standard
PRM-based selection. This raises a critical question: How can we effectively
utilize verification signals from PRMs for TTS? To address this, we start by
developing a theoretical framework for optimally combining signals from both
the LLM and the PRM. Our framework reveals that the optimal strategy is a
weighted aggregation of responses, a strategy whose effectiveness hinges on
estimating weights that capture the complex interplay between the models. Based
on our theoretical results, we empirically show that these optimal weighting
functions differ significantly across LLM-PRM pairs and, notably, often assign
substantial negative weights. Motivated by these insights, we propose efficient
pre-computation methods to calibrate these weighting functions. Extensive
experiments across 5 LLMs and 7 PRMs demonstrate that our calibration method
significantly boosts the TTS efficiency, surpassing the performance of vanilla
weighted majority voting while using only $21.3\%$ of the computation.
Ultimately, our work demonstrates that investing in a more intelligent
aggregation strategy can be a more convincing path to performance gains than
simply scaling test-time computation.

Conclusion: FACTS通过模板复用、SQL可执行性、隐私保护机制，为真实场景的表格摘要提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Query-focused table summarization requires generating natural language
summaries of tabular data conditioned on a user query, enabling users to access
insights beyond fact retrieval. Existing approaches face key limitations:
table-to-text models require costly fine-tuning and struggle with complex
reasoning, prompt-based LLM methods suffer from token-limit and efficiency
issues while exposing sensitive data, and prior agentic pipelines often rely on
decomposition, planning, or manual templates that lack robustness and
scalability. To mitigate these issues, we introduce an agentic workflow, FACTS,
a Fast, Accurate, and Privacy-Compliant Table Summarization approach via
Offline Template Generation. FACTS produces offline templates, consisting of
SQL queries and Jinja2 templates, which can be rendered into natural language
summaries and are reusable across multiple tables sharing the same schema. It
enables fast summarization through reusable offline templates, accurate outputs
with executable SQL queries, and privacy compliance by sending only table
schemas to LLMs. Evaluations on widely-used benchmarks show that FACTS
consistently outperforms baseline methods, establishing it as a practical
solution for real-world query-focused table summarization.

Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) networks generate diverse and high-volume traffic
that reflects both normal activity and potential threats. Deriving meaningful
insight from such telemetry requires cross-layer interpretation of behaviors,
protocols, and context rather than isolated detection. This work presents an
LLM-powered AI agent framework that converts raw packet captures into
structured and semantically enriched representations for interactive analysis.
The framework integrates feature extraction, transformer-based anomaly
detection, packet and flow summarization, threat intelligence enrichment, and
retrieval-augmented question answering. An AI agent guided by a large language
model performs reasoning over the indexed traffic artifacts, assembling
evidence to produce accurate and human-readable interpretations. Experimental
evaluation on multiple IoT captures and six open models shows that hybrid
retrieval, which combines lexical and semantic search with reranking,
substantially improves BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, and BERTScore results compared with
dense-only retrieval. System profiling further indicates low CPU, GPU, and
memory overhead, demonstrating that the framework achieves holistic and
efficient interpretation of IoT network traffic.

Conclusion: 该框架通过结构化检索流程有效提升生物医学推理能力，公开的3,000题多级评测集为领域研究提供新基准。

Abstract: Biomedical queries often rely on a deep understanding of specialized
knowledge such as gene regulatory mechanisms and pathological processes of
diseases. They require detailed analysis of complex physiological processes and
effective integration of information from multiple data sources to support
accurate retrieval and reasoning. Although large language models (LLMs) perform
well in general reasoning tasks, their generated biomedical content often lacks
scientific rigor due to the inability to access authoritative biomedical
databases and frequently fabricates protein functions, interactions, and
structural details that deviate from authentic information. Therefore, we
present BioMedSearch, a multi-source biomedical information retrieval framework
based on LLMs. The method integrates literature retrieval, protein database and
web search access to support accurate and efficient handling of complex
biomedical queries. Through sub-queries decomposition, keywords extraction,
task graph construction, and multi-source information filtering, BioMedSearch
generates high-quality question-answering results. To evaluate the accuracy of
question answering, we constructed a multi-level dataset, BioMedMCQs,
consisting of 3,000 questions. The dataset covers three levels of reasoning:
mechanistic identification, non-adjacent semantic integration, and temporal
causal reasoning, and is used to assess the performance of BioMedSearch and
other methods on complex QA tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that
BioMedSearch consistently improves accuracy over all baseline models across all
levels. Specifically, at Level 1, the average accuracy increases from 59.1% to
91.9%; at Level 2, it rises from 47.0% to 81.0%; and at the most challenging
Level 3, the average accuracy improves from 36.3% to 73.4%. The code and

Method: 使用真实Twitter/X语料构建垃圾/控制数据集，通过参与度(M1)和语义质量(M2)正交操作化，在4个LLM上进行控制变量实验

Result: 垃圾数据训练导致推理(ARC-Challenge下降74.9→57.2)、长上下文理解(RULER-CWE 84.4→52.3)、安全性下降，呈现剂量效应；思维跳跃成为主要错误机制

Conclusion: 数据质量是LLM能力退化的核心驱动因素，需将持续预训练数据治理视为训练期安全问题，建议部署模型进行常规认知健康检查

Abstract: We propose and test the LLM Brain Rot Hypothesis: continual exposure to junk
web text induces lasting cognitive decline in large language models (LLMs). To
causally isolate data quality, we run controlled experiments on real Twitter/X
corpora, constructing junk and reversely controlled datasets via two orthogonal
operationalizations: M1 (engagement degree) and M2 (semantic quality), with
matched token scale and training operations across conditions. Contrary to the
control group, continual pre-training of 4 LLMs on the junk dataset causes
non-trivial declines (Hedges' $g>0.3$) on reasoning, long-context
understanding, safety, and inflating "dark traits" (e.g., psychopathy,
narcissism). The gradual mixtures of junk and control datasets also yield
dose-response cognition decay: for example, under M1, ARC-Challenge with Chain
Of Thoughts drops $74.9 \rightarrow 57.2$ and RULER-CWE $84.4 \rightarrow 52.3$
as junk ratio rises from $0\%$ to $100\%$.
  Error forensics reveal several key insights. First, we identify
thought-skipping as the primary lesion: models increasingly truncate or skip
reasoning chains, explaining most of the error growth. Second, partial but
incomplete healing is observed: scaling instruction tuning and clean data
pre-training improve the declined cognition yet cannot restore baseline
capability, suggesting persistent representational drift rather than format
mismatch. Finally, we discover that the popularity, a non-semantic metric, of a
tweet is a better indicator of the Brain Rot effect than the length in M1.
Together, the results provide significant, multi-perspective evidence that data
quality is a causal driver of LLM capability decay, reframing curation for
continual pretraining as a \textit{training-time safety} problem and motivating
routine "cognitive health checks" for deployed LLMs.

TL;DR: 发现大语言模型在药物安全预测中存在基于社会人口统计的显性和隐性偏见


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证LLMs在药物不良反应预测中是否引入临床无关的社会人口学因素

Method: 使用FDA不良事件报告系统数据，通过基于角色的评估框架测试ChatGPT-4o和Bio-Medical-Llama-3.8B模型

Result: 发现弱势群体被预测更高不良反应风险，揭示显性（直接引用人口属性）和隐性（预测不一致但未提及属性）两种偏见模式

Conclusion: 暴露LLMs在药物警戒应用中的风险，强调临床部署前需建立公平性评估和缓解策略

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in biomedical domains,
yet their reliability in drug-safety prediction remains underexplored. In this
work, we investigate whether LLMs incorporate socio-demographic information
into adverse event (AE) predictions, despite such attributes being clinically
irrelevant. Using structured data from the United States Food and Drug
Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and a persona-based
evaluation framework, we assess two state-of-the-art models, ChatGPT-4o and
Bio-Medical-Llama-3.8B, across diverse personas defined by education, marital
status, employment, insurance, language, housing stability, and religion. We
further evaluate performance across three user roles (general practitioner,
specialist, patient) to reflect real-world deployment scenarios where
commercial systems often differentiate access by user type. Our results reveal
systematic disparities in AE prediction accuracy. Disadvantaged groups (e.g.,
low education, unstable housing) were frequently assigned higher predicted AE
likelihoods than more privileged groups (e.g., postgraduate-educated, privately
insured). Beyond outcome disparities, we identify two distinct modes of bias:
explicit bias, where incorrect predictions directly reference persona
attributes in reasoning traces, and implicit bias, where predictions are
inconsistent, yet personas are not explicitly mentioned. These findings expose
critical risks in applying LLMs to pharmacovigilance and highlight the urgent
need for fairness-aware evaluation protocols and mitigation strategies before
clinical deployment.

TL;DR: 通过构建指令检索机制，在推理阶段为小型语言模型提供结构化推理步骤，显著提升医学/法律/数学领域任务表现（最高提升9.4%）


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型语言模型在本地硬件运行时存在隐私/成本/环保优势，但其多步推理和领域知识处理能力存在明显短板

Method: 1. 使用GPT-5创建类似问题的结构化推理指令库
2. 推理时模型检索并执行最相关指令步骤
3. 区别于传统文本检索，提供结构化推理引导

Result: 在未微调情况下，3B-14B模型在MedQA提升9.4%（医学考试）、MMLU法律提升7.9%、MathQA提升5.1%

Conclusion: 指令简洁性优于长指令，改进幅度与模型家族固有推理能力强相关，验证了结构化指令检索的有效性

Abstract: Can we bring large-scale reasoning to local-scale compute? Small language
models (SLMs) are increasingly attractive because they run efficiently on local
hardware, offering strong privacy, low cost, and reduced environmental impact.
Yet they often struggle with tasks that require multi-step reasoning or
domain-specific knowledge. We address this limitation through instruction
intervention at inference time, where an SLM retrieves structured reasoning
procedures rather than generating them from scratch. Our method builds an
Instruction Corpus by grouping similar training questions and creating
instructions via GPT-5. During inference, the SLM retrieves the most relevant
instructions and follows their steps. Unlike retrieval-augmented generation,
which retrieves text passages, instruction retrieval gives the model structured
guidance for reasoning. We evaluate this framework on MedQA (medical board
exams), MMLU Professional Law, and MathQA using models from 3B to 14B
parameters without any additional fine-tuning. Instruction retrieval yields
consistent gains: 9.4% on MedQA, 7.9% on MMLU Law, and 5.1% on MathQA. Concise
instructions outperform longer ones, and the magnitude of improvement depends
strongly on model family and intrinsic reasoning ability.

Abstract: Deep Research (DR) agents, powered by advanced Large Language Models (LLMs),
have recently garnered increasing attention for their capability in conducting
complex research tasks. However, existing literature lacks a rigorous and
systematic evaluation of DR Agent's capabilities in critical research analysis.
To address this gap, we first propose HisRubric, a novel evaluation framework
with a hierarchical analytical structure and a fine-grained grading rubric for
rigorously assessing DR agents' capabilities in corporate financial analysis.
This framework mirrors the professional analyst's workflow, progressing from
data recognition to metric calculation, and finally to strategic summarization
and interpretation. Built on this framework, we construct a FinDeepResearch
benchmark that comprises 64 listed companies from 8 financial markets across 4
languages, encompassing a total of 15,808 grading items. We further conduct
extensive experiments on the FinDeepResearch using 16 representative methods,
including 6 DR agents, 5 LLMs equipped with both deep reasoning and search
capabilities, and 5 LLMs with deep reasoning capabilities only. The results
reveal the strengths and limitations of these approaches across diverse
capabilities, financial markets, and languages, offering valuable insights for
future research and development. The benchmark and evaluation code will be made
publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI模型是否能在模仿作者风格的同时生成高质量文学作品，以及相关技术对版权法第四合理使用要素（市场影响）的实证依据。

Method: 采用预先注册研究设计，让专业作家与ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini生成450字文本，通过159名专家和普通读者进行盲测评估，并对比上下文提示与微调模型的效果差异。

Result: 微调后的AI文本在专家评估中风格逼真度(OR=8.16)和写作质量(OR=1.87)显著优于人类，检测率仅3%，且成本降低至每作者81美元（降幅99.7%）。

Conclusion: 作者特定微调使AI生成非逐字复制的优质内容，实证表明其可能影响原著市场价值，为版权纠纷中的合理使用判定提供关键证据。

Abstract: The use of copyrighted books for training AI models has led to numerous
lawsuits from authors concerned about AI's ability to generate derivative
content.Yet it's unclear whether these models can generate high quality
literary text while emulating authors' styles. To answer this we conducted a
preregistered study comparing MFA-trained expert writers with three frontier AI
models: ChatGPT, Claude & Gemini in writing up to 450 word excerpts emulating
50 award-winning authors' diverse styles. In blind pairwise evaluations by 159
representative expert & lay readers, AI-generated text from in-context
prompting was strongly disfavored by experts for both stylistic fidelity
(OR=0.16, p<10^8) & writing quality (OR=0.13, p<10^7) but showed mixed results
with lay readers. However, fine-tuning ChatGPT on individual authors' complete
works completely reversed these findings: experts now favored AI-generated text
for stylistic fidelity (OR=8.16, p<10^13) & writing quality (OR=1.87, p=0.010),
with lay readers showing similar shifts. These effects generalize across
authors & styles. The fine-tuned outputs were rarely flagged as AI-generated
(3% rate v. 97% for in-context prompting) by best AI detectors. Mediation
analysis shows this reversal occurs because fine-tuning eliminates detectable
AI stylistic quirks (e.g., cliche density) that penalize in-context outputs.
While we do not account for additional costs of human effort required to
transform raw AI output into cohesive, publishable prose, the median
fine-tuning & inference cost of $81 per author represents a dramatic 99.7%
reduction compared to typical professional writer compensation. Author-specific
fine-tuning thus enables non-verbatim AI writing that readers prefer to expert
human writing, providing empirical evidence directly relevant to copyright's
fourth fair-use factor, the "effect upon the potential market or value" of the
source works.

Motivation: 针对LLM测试时扩展带来的效率与计算成本矛盾，发现推理不确定性主要由少量高熵token主导的现象，提出精准干预方案

Method: 包含选择性CFG干预（仅作用于不确定位置）和轻量级负提示（复用KV缓存近似无条件解码）两个训练无关组件

Result: 在通用/编程/STEM任务中稳定提升：Qwen3-8B八项基准平均+1.35%，Qwen3-32B在AIME2024实现+5%提升

Conclusion: MTI验证了局部干预的有效性，为提升LLM推理效率提供新范式，证明精准干预可替代粗放式计算扩展

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has focused on test-time
scaling to improve reasoning via increased inference computation, but often at
the cost of efficiency. We revisit test-time behavior and uncover a simple yet
underexplored phenomenon: reasoning uncertainty is highly localized-only a
small subset of high-entropy tokens dominantly affects output correctness.
Motivated by this, we propose Minimal Test-Time Intervention (MTI), a
training-free framework that enhances reasoning accuracy and stability with
minimal overhead. MTI includes: (i) Selective CFG intervention, applying
classifier-free guidance only at uncertain positions; and (ii) Lightweight
negative-prompt guidance, reusing the main model's KV cache to approximate
unconditional decoding efficiently. MTI yields consistent gains across general,
coding, and STEM tasks-e.g., +1.35% average improvement on eight benchmarks for
Qwen3-8B-Base and +5% on AIME2024 using Qwen3-32B-Reasoning-while remaining
highly efficient.

Method: 构建错误类型分类体系，创建标注数据集，开发基于分类的自动评估框架

Result: 建立首个RAG错误分类数据集，开源代码支持错误追踪与修复

Conclusion: 该分类体系为提升RAG系统可靠性提供系统化诊断工具和解决方案

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a prevalent approach for building
LLM-based question-answering systems that can take advantage of external
knowledge databases. Due to the complexity of real-world RAG systems, there are
many potential causes for erroneous outputs. Understanding the range of errors
that can occur in practice is crucial for robust deployment. We present a new
taxonomy of the error types that can occur in realistic RAG systems, examples
of each, and practical advice for addressing them. Additionally, we curate a
dataset of erroneous RAG responses annotated by error types. We then propose an
auto-evaluation method aligned with our taxonomy that can be used in practice
to track and address errors during development. Code and data are available at
https://github.com/layer6ai-labs/rag-error-classification.

Motivation: 现有语言模型训练数据普遍存在授权不明确问题，德语等非英语语种的开放授权文本尤其匮乏，严重阻碍真正开源模型的开发。

Method: 从可验证版权的数据源系统收集数据，实施质量过滤、去重和文本格式化处理流程，配套发布德语语料构建与过滤的定制化代码。

Result: 产出符合CC-BY-SA 4.0及以上标准的1545.6亿高质量token，各领域子集均满足模型训练和分发的法律要求。

Conclusion: German Commons填补了德语预训练数据的开放授权空白，配套工具链使其具备完全可复现和可扩展性，推动真正开源的德语语言模型发展。

Abstract: Large language model development relies on large-scale training corpora, yet
most contain data of unclear licensing status, limiting the development of
truly open models. This problem is exacerbated for non-English languages, where
openly licensed text remains critically scarce. We introduce the German
Commons, the largest collection of openly licensed German text to date. It
compiles data from 41 sources across seven domains, encompassing legal,
scientific, cultural, political, news, economic, and web text. Through
systematic sourcing from established data providers with verifiable licensing,
it yields 154.56 billion tokens of high-quality text for language model
training. Our processing pipeline implements comprehensive quality filtering,
deduplication, and text formatting fixes, ensuring consistent quality across
heterogeneous text sources. All domain subsets feature licenses of at least
CC-BY-SA 4.0 or equivalent, ensuring legal compliance for model training and
redistribution. The German Commons therefore addresses the critical gap in
openly licensed German pretraining data, and enables the development of truly
open German language models. We also release code for corpus construction and
data filtering tailored to German language text, rendering the German Commons
fully reproducible and extensible.

TL;DR: 提出CRaFT框架评估大语言模型跨文化推理能力，发现模型文化意识依赖语言框架而非内在特性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统准确性评估无法揭示模型对文化语境的理解，需建立解释性框架分析跨文化推理机制

Method: 使用世界价值观调查50个文化相关问题，翻译为阿拉伯语/孟加拉语/西班牙语，评估3个模型（GPT/DeepSeek/FANAR）的2,100+答案-解释对，采用文化流畅度、偏离度、一致性和语言适应四个解释性指标

Result: 语言显著影响推理质量：阿拉伯语降低流畅性（-14%），孟加拉语提升（+9%），西班牙语稳定；GPT语言适应强但一致性低，FANAR推理稳定但文化灵活性差

Conclusion: LLMs的文化意识源于语言框架而非内在理解，CRaFT为多语言文化适应性模型开发提供新评估维度

Abstract: Correct answers do not necessarily reflect cultural understanding. We
introduce CRaFT, an explanation-based multilingual evaluation framework
designed to assess how large language models (LLMs) reason across cultural
contexts. Rather than scoring outputs solely based on accuracy, CRaFT evaluates
model explanations using four interpretable metrics: Cultural Fluency,
Deviation, Consistency, and Linguistic Adaptation. We apply the framework to 50
culturally grounded questions from the World Values Survey, translated into
Arabic, Bengali, and Spanish, and evaluate three models (GPT, DeepSeek, and
FANAR) across over 2,100 answer-explanation pairs. Results reveal significant
cross-lingual variation in reasoning: Arabic reduces fluency, Bengali enhances
it, and Spanish remains largely stable. While GPT adapts more effectively
across languages, it exhibits lower consistency; FANAR shows stable but rigid
reasoning. These findings suggest that cultural awareness in LLMs is not
intrinsic but emerges through linguistic framing. CRaFT offers a new lens for
evaluating cross-cultural reasoning in multilingual settings, providing
actionable insights for building culturally adaptive language models.

Conclusion: 强调多语言评估对揭示模型偏差的重要性，提出难度控制方法为后续研究提供新范式，指明开源模型在抽象推理领域的改进方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can exhibit biases in reasoning capabilities due
to linguistic modality, performing better on tasks in one language versus
another, even with similar content. Most previous works evaluate this through
reasoning tasks where reliance on strategies or knowledge can ensure success,
such as in commonsense or math tasks. However, abstract reasoning is vital to
reasoning for everyday life, where people apply "out-of-the-box thinking" to
identify and use patterns for solutions, without a reliance on formulaic
approaches. Comparatively, little work has evaluated linguistic biases in this
task type. In this paper, we propose a task inspired by the New York Times
Connections: GlobalGroup, that evaluates models in an abstract reasoning task
across several languages. We constructed a game benchmark with five linguistic
backgrounds -- English, Spanish, Chinese, Hindi, and Arabic -- in both the
native language and an English translation for comparison. We also proposed
game difficulty measurements to evaluate models on games with similar
difficulty, enabling a more controlled comparison, which is particularly
important in reasoning evaluations. Through experimentation, we find English
modalities largely lead to better performance in this abstract reasoning task,
and performance disparities between open- and closed-source models.

Conclusion: 语音语义象似性存在系统性规律且具有跨语言普适性，为语言认知机制研究提供新视角

Abstract: Language is, as commonly theorized, largely arbitrary. Yet, systematic
relationships between phonetics and semantics have been observed in many
specific cases. To what degree could those systematic relationships manifest
themselves in large scale, quantitative investigations--both in previously
identified and unidentified phenomena? This work undertakes a distributional
approach to quantifying phonosemantic iconicity at scale across 6 diverse
languages (English, Spanish, Hindi, Finnish, Turkish, and Tamil). In each
language, we analyze the alignment of morphemes' phonetic and semantic
similarity spaces with a suite of statistical measures, and discover an array
of interpretable phonosemantic alignments not previously identified in the
literature, along with crosslinguistic patterns. We also analyze 5 previously
hypothesized phonosemantic alignments, finding support for some such alignments
and mixed results for others.

Method: 提出ERGO框架：持续量化token分布的香农熵，在熵值突变时触发自适应提示整合机制

Result: 实验显示ERGO使性能平均提升56.6%，峰值能力提高24.7%，可靠性指标改善35.3%

Conclusion: 将不确定性作为核心信号而非干扰因素，可同时提升对话AI的准确性和可靠性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer significant performance degradation in
multi-turn conversations when information is presented incrementally. Given
that multi-turn conversations characterize everyday interactions with LLMs,
this degradation poses a severe challenge to real world usability. We
hypothesize that abrupt increases in model uncertainty signal misalignment in
multi-turn LLM interactions, and we exploit this insight to dynamically realign
conversational context. We introduce ERGO (Entropy-guided Resetting for
Generation Optimization), which continuously quantifies internal uncertainty
via Shannon entropy over next token distributions and triggers adaptive prompt
consolidation when a sharp spike in entropy is detected. By treating
uncertainty as a first class signal rather than a nuisance to eliminate, ERGO
embraces variability in language and modeling, representing and responding to
uncertainty. In multi-turn tasks with incrementally revealed instructions, ERGO
yields a 56.6% average performance gain over standard baselines, increases
aptitude (peak performance capability) by 24.7%, and decreases unreliability
(variability in performance) by 35.3%, demonstrating that uncertainty aware
interventions can improve both accuracy and reliability in conversational AI.

Result: 在多个意图基准测试中超越SOTA，已知意图macro-F1提升6-15%，OOS意图提升8-20%，参数仅1.5M

Conclusion: 双编码表示与简单校准机制的结合，为神经对话系统提供了高效可靠的OOS检测方案

Abstract: Detecting out-of-scope (OOS) user utterances remains a key challenge in
task-oriented dialogue systems and, more broadly, in open-set intent
recognition. Existing approaches often depend on strong distributional
assumptions or auxiliary calibration modules. We present DROID (Dual
Representation for Out-of-Scope Intent Detection), a compact end-to-end
framework that combines two complementary encoders -- the Universal Sentence
Encoder (USE) for broad semantic generalization and a domain-adapted
Transformer-based Denoising Autoencoder (TSDAE) for domain-specific contextual
distinctions. Their fused representations are processed by a lightweight
branched classifier with a single calibrated threshold that separates in-domain
and OOS intents without post-hoc scoring. To enhance boundary learning under
limited supervision, DROID incorporates both synthetic and open-domain outlier
augmentation. Despite using only 1.5M trainable parameters, DROID consistently
outperforms recent state-of-the-art baselines across multiple intent
benchmarks, achieving macro-F1 improvements of 6--15% for known and 8--20% for
OOS intents, with the most significant gains in low-resource settings. These
results demonstrate that dual-encoder representations with simple calibration
can yield robust, scalable, and reliable OOS detection for neural dialogue
systems.

Result: RLSR单独使用使Qwen-7B在AlpacaEval胜率从21.01%提升至26.34%；与SFT结合后达到30.73%，显著优于基线方法

Conclusion: RLSR不仅可替代SFT实现更优性能，还能与其协同增强效果，验证了强化学习在指令对齐中的有效性，为高效语义对齐提供新思路

Abstract: After the pretraining stage of LLMs, techniques such as SFT, RLHF, RLVR, and
RFT are applied to enhance instruction-following ability, mitigate undesired
responses, improve reasoning capability and enable efficient domain adaptation
with minimal data. SFT relies on the next-token prediction objective to
strengthen instruction following in a base model using a large corpus of
human-labeled responses. In contrast, RFT employs a RL-based approach to adapt
fine-tuned reasoning models to specific domains with limited supervision.
Inspired by RFT, we propose replacing SFT with RLSR to leverage the extensive
SFT dataset in an RL framework, thereby improving the base model's
instruction-following ability. In RLSR, the base model generates multiple
responses for each prompt, and reward scores are computed as the cosine
similarity in the semantic embedding space between the generated and
human-labeled responses. RLSR can be utilized in multiple ways. It can directly
replace SFT, achieving superior performance on instruction-following
benchmarks-for example, RLSR (SB) on Qwen-7B (INFINITY) achieved an AlpacaEval
win rate of 26.34%, surpassing SFT's 21.01%. Furthermore, combining SFT and
RLSR further enhances downstream task performance; Qwen-7B (INFINITY) achieved
a win rate of 30.73% when trained with SFT + RLSR.

Motivation: 现有角色代理使用手动配置人物档案缺乏验证，导致行为与目标个体偏差

Method: DPRF框架通过自由形式/理论驱动的结构化分析，迭代识别生成行为与真实数据间的认知差异，持续优化人物档案

Result: 在4种行为预测场景测试中，DPRF使行为对齐度平均提升25.7%，且具备跨模型和场景的泛化能力

Conclusion: 该框架为构建高保真数字人格提供方法论，支持用户模拟、社会研究等下游应用验证

Abstract: The emerging large language model role-playing agents (LLM RPAs) aim to
simulate individual human behaviors, but the persona fidelity is often
undermined by manually-created profiles (e.g., cherry-picked information and
personality characteristics) without validating the alignment with the target
individuals. To address this limitation, our work introduces the Dynamic
Persona Refinement Framework (DPRF).DPRF aims to optimize the alignment of LLM
RPAs' behaviors with those of target individuals by iteratively identifying the
cognitive divergence, either through free-form or theory-grounded, structured
analysis, between generated behaviors and human ground truth, and refining the
persona profile to mitigate these divergences.We evaluate DPRF with five LLMs
on four diverse behavior-prediction scenarios: formal debates, social media
posts with mental health issues, public interviews, and movie reviews.DPRF can
consistently improve behavioral alignment considerably over baseline personas
and generalizes across models and scenarios.Our work provides a robust
methodology for creating high-fidelity persona profiles and enhancing the
validity of downstream applications, such as user simulation, social studies,
and personalized AI.

Motivation: 现有层跳过技术在多阶段推理中存在阶段敏感度差异大和冗余令牌生成的问题，难以平衡效率与准确性

Method: 结合阶段化离线搜索（优化层预算分配）和在线置信度早退机制（抑制冗余解码）的两阶段优化框架

Result: 在OBQA、CSQA、StrategyQA基准上实现最高1.70倍加速，准确率损失控制在4%以内，优于现有免训练层跳过方法

Conclusion: LiteStage通过联合优化层分配策略和生成终止机制，在保持较低准确率损失的同时显著提升多阶段推理任务的执行效率

Abstract: Multi-stage reasoning has emerged as an effective strategy for enhancing the
reasoning capability of small language models by decomposing complex problems
into sequential sub-stages. However, this comes at the cost of increased
latency. We observe that existing adaptive acceleration techniques, such as
layer skipping, struggle to balance efficiency and accuracy in this setting due
to two key challenges: (1) stage-wise variation in skip sensitivity, and (2)
the generation of redundant output tokens. To address these, we propose
LiteStage, a latency-aware layer skipping framework for multi-stage reasoning.
LiteStage combines a stage-wise offline search that allocates optimal layer
budgets with an online confidence-based generation early exit to suppress
unnecessary decoding. Experiments on three benchmarks, e.g., OBQA, CSQA, and
StrategyQA, show that LiteStage achieves up to 1.70x speedup with less than
4.0% accuracy loss, outperforming prior training-free layer skipping methods.

TL;DR: 提出Flip-Flop Consistency（F²C）无监督训练方法，通过共识交叉熵和表示对齐损失提升大语言模型对提示词扰动的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型面对相同语义不同表述的提示词时会产生不一致答案，影响模型可靠性和应用部署。

Method: 包含两个核心组件：1）Consensus Cross-Entropy（CCE）通过多数投票生成伪标签；2）表示对齐损失将低置信度预测向共识对齐。

Result: 在11个NLP数据集上平均提升F1值8.94%，协议一致性提高11.62%，方差降低3.29%，域外评估显示良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: F²C有效增强了大语言模型在提示词扰动下的稳定性、性能和泛化能力，且无需监督数据。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce inconsistent answers when faced
with different phrasings of the same prompt. In this paper, we propose
Flip-Flop Consistency ($F^2C$), an unsupervised training method that improves
robustness to such perturbations. $F^2C$ is composed of two key components. The
first, Consensus Cross-Entropy (CCE), uses a majority vote across prompt
variations to create a hard pseudo-label. The second is a representation
alignment loss that pulls lower-confidence and non-majority predictors toward
the consensus established by high-confidence, majority-voting variations. We
evaluate our method on 11 datasets spanning four NLP tasks, with 4-15 prompt
variations per dataset. On average, $F^2C$ raises observed agreement by 11.62%,
improves mean $F_1$ by 8.94%, and reduces performance variance across formats
by 3.29%. In out-of-domain evaluations, $F^2C$ generalizes effectively,
increasing $\overline{F_1}$ and agreement while decreasing variance across most
source-target pairs. Finally, when trained on only a subset of prompt
perturbations and evaluated on held-out formats, $F^2C$ consistently improves
both performance and agreement while reducing variance. These findings
highlight $F^2C$ as an effective unsupervised method for enhancing LLM
consistency, performance, and generalization under prompt perturbations. Code

Conclusion: MoM框架突破被动分片范式，通过结构化记忆提取和认知训练机制，为LLM/SLM实现人类中心智能文本处理提供新路径

Abstract: The traditional RAG paradigm, which typically engages in the comprehension of
relevant text chunks in response to received queries, inherently restricts both
the depth of knowledge internalization and reasoning capabilities. To address
this limitation, our research transforms the text processing in RAG from
passive chunking to proactive understanding, defining this process as document
memory extraction with the objective of simulating human cognitive processes
during reading. Building upon this, we propose the Mixtures of scenario-aware
document Memories (MoM) framework, engineered to efficiently handle documents
from multiple domains and train small language models (SLMs) to acquire the
ability to proactively explore and construct document memories. The MoM
initially instructs large language models (LLMs) to simulate domain experts in
generating document logical outlines, thereby directing structured chunking and
core content extraction. It employs a multi-path sampling and multi-perspective
evaluation mechanism, specifically designing comprehensive metrics that
represent chunk clarity and extraction completeness to select the optimal
document memories. Additionally, to infuse deeper human-like reading abilities
during the training of SLMs, we incorporate a reverse reasoning strategy, which
deduces refined expert thinking paths from high-quality outcomes. Finally,
leveraging diverse forms of content generated by MoM, we develop a three-layer
document memory retrieval mechanism, which is grounded in our theoretical proof
from the perspective of probabilistic modeling. Extensive experimental results
across three distinct domains demonstrate that the MoM framework not only
resolves text chunking challenges in existing RAG systems, providing LLMs with
semantically complete document memories, but also paves the way for SLMs to
achieve human-centric intelligent text processing.

Conclusion: 建立可扩展的实验框架帮助研究者验证训练数据影响假说，代码开源促进后续研究

Abstract: We present an experimental recipe for studying the relationship between
training data and language model (LM) behavior. We outline steps for
intervening on data batches -- i.e., ``rewriting history'' -- and then
retraining model checkpoints over that data to test hypotheses relating data to
behavior. Our recipe breaks down such an intervention into stages that include
selecting evaluation items from a benchmark that measures model behavior,
matching relevant documents to those items, and modifying those documents
before retraining and measuring the effects. We demonstrate the utility of our
recipe through case studies on factual knowledge acquisition in LMs, using both
cooccurrence statistics and information retrieval methods to identify documents
that might contribute to knowledge learning. Our results supplement past
observational analyses that link cooccurrence to model behavior, while
demonstrating that extant methods for identifying relevant training documents
do not fully explain an LM's ability to correctly answer knowledge questions.
Overall, we outline a recipe that researchers can follow to test further
hypotheses about how training data affects model behavior. Our code is made
publicly available to promote future work.

Conclusion: 首次系统解决LLM生成知识图谱的去噪问题，实验证明简单方法即可同时优化计算效率和问答性能，填补该领域研究空白

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enable large language models
(LLMs) instant access to relevant information for the generative process,
demonstrating their superior performance in addressing common LLM challenges
such as hallucination, factual inaccuracy, and the knowledge cutoff.
Graph-based RAG further extends this paradigm by incorporating knowledge graphs
(KGs) to leverage rich, structured connections for more precise and inferential
responses. A critical challenge, however, is that most Graph-based RAG systems
rely on LLMs for automated KG construction, often yielding noisy KGs with
redundant entities and unreliable relationships. This noise degrades retrieval
and generation performance while also increasing computational cost. Crucially,
current research does not comprehensively address the denoising problem for
LLM-generated KGs. In this paper, we introduce DEnoised knowledge Graphs for
Retrieval Augmented Generation (DEG-RAG), a framework that addresses these
challenges through: (1) entity resolution, which eliminates redundant entities,
and (2) triple reflection, which removes erroneous relations. Together, these
techniques yield more compact, higher-quality KGs that significantly outperform
their unprocessed counterparts. Beyond the methods, we conduct a systematic
evaluation of entity resolution for LLM-generated KGs, examining different
blocking strategies, embedding choices, similarity metrics, and entity merging
techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive
exploration of entity resolution in LLM-generated KGs. Our experiments
demonstrate that this straightforward approach not only drastically reduces
graph size but also consistently improves question answering performance across
diverse popular Graph-based RAG variants.

Result: 开发出300M参数紧凑模型，在检索任务上与当前7B模型相当或更优

Conclusion: 训练策略优化（特别是任务多样性）比单纯扩大模型规模更能提升检索性能

Abstract: Training effective multilingual embedding models presents unique challenges
due to the diversity of languages and task objectives. Although small
multilingual models (<1 B parameters) perform well on multilingual tasks
generally, they consistently lag behind larger models (>1 B) in the most
prevalent use case: retrieval. This raises a critical question: Can smaller
models be retrofitted specifically for retrieval tasks to enhance their
performance? In this work, we investigate key factors that influence the
effectiveness of multilingual embeddings, focusing on training data scale,
negative sampling strategies, and data diversity. We find that while increasing
the scale of training data yields initial performance gains, these improvements
quickly plateau - indicating diminishing returns. Incorporating hard negatives
proves essential for consistently improving retrieval accuracy. Furthermore,
our analysis reveals that task diversity in the training data contributes more
significantly to performance than language diversity alone. As a result, we
develop a compact (approximately 300M) multilingual model that achieves
retrieval performance comparable to or even surpassing current strong 7B
models.

Conclusion: Qwen3Guard通过细粒度分类和实时监控能力，为LLM全球部署提供了可扩展、低延迟的安全保障解决方案。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more capable and widely used, ensuring
the safety of their outputs is increasingly critical. Existing guardrail
models, though useful in static evaluation settings, face two major limitations
in real-world applications: (1) they typically output only binary "safe/unsafe"
labels, which can be interpreted inconsistently across diverse safety policies,
rendering them incapable of accommodating varying safety tolerances across
domains; and (2) they require complete model outputs before performing safety
checks, making them fundamentally incompatible with streaming LLM inference,
thereby preventing timely intervention during generation and increasing
exposure to harmful partial outputs. To address these challenges, we present
Qwen3Guard, a series of multilingual safety guardrail models with two
specialized variants: Generative Qwen3Guard, which casts safety classification
as an instruction-following task to enable fine-grained tri-class judgments
(safe, controversial, unsafe); and Stream Qwen3Guard, which introduces a
token-level classification head for real-time safety monitoring during
incremental text generation. Both variants are available in three sizes (0.6B,
4B, and 8B parameters) and support up to 119 languages and dialects, providing
comprehensive, scalable, and low-latency safety moderation for global LLM
deployments. Evaluated across English, Chinese, and multilingual benchmarks,
Qwen3Guard achieves state-of-the-art performance in both prompt and response
safety classification. All models are released under the Apache 2.0 license for
public use.

Result: 在HotpotQA等四个基准测试中优于基线模型，检索准确率提升同时过滤83%冗余内容，使下游模型答案准确率提高12%且依赖信息量减少60%。

Conclusion: 结构化代理协作机制有效平衡检索系统的精度与召回需求，证明模块化设计在多跳复杂任务中的优势，为QA系统优化提供新范式。

Abstract: Retrieval plays a central role in multi-hop question answering (QA), where
answering complex questions requires gathering multiple pieces of evidence. We
introduce an Agentic Retrieval System that leverages large language models
(LLMs) in a structured loop to retrieve relevant evidence with high precision
and recall. Our framework consists of three specialized agents: a Question
Analyzer that decomposes a multi-hop question into sub-questions, a Selector
that identifies the most relevant context for each sub-question (focusing on
precision), and an Adder that brings in any missing evidence (focusing on
recall). The iterative interaction between Selector and Adder yields a compact
yet comprehensive set of supporting passages. In particular, it achieves higher
retrieval accuracy while filtering out distracting content, enabling downstream
QA models to surpass full-context answer accuracy while relying on
significantly less irrelevant information. Experiments on four multi-hop QA
benchmarks -- HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, MuSiQue, and MultiHopRAG --
demonstrates that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines.

Motivation: 现有Text-to-SQL系统过度关注SQL生成而忽视模式链接，导致模式元素检索不全引发执行失败。需要将模式链接作为独立问题进行研究

Method: 1. 双向检索策略：表格优先检索+列选择 / 列优先检索+表选择 2. 增强技术：问题分解、关键词提取、关键短语抽取 3. 构建上下文感知的独立模式链接框架

Result: 在BIRD/Spider基准测试中：1. 模式召回率显著提升，误报减少 2. SQL生成性能超越全模式基线，接近oracle水平 3. 完美模式与全模式性能差距缩小50%

Conclusion: 模式链接是提升Text-to-SQL系统性能的关键杠杆，独立模式链接框架可有效改善执行准确率，无需查询优化即可接近理想性能

Abstract: Schema linking -- the process of aligning natural language questions with
database schema elements -- is a critical yet underexplored component of
Text-to-SQL systems. While recent methods have focused primarily on improving
SQL generation, they often neglect the retrieval of relevant schema elements,
which can lead to hallucinations and execution failures. In this work, we
propose a context-aware bidirectional schema retrieval framework that treats
schema linking as a standalone problem. Our approach combines two complementary
strategies: table-first retrieval followed by column selection, and
column-first retrieval followed by table selection. It is further augmented
with techniques such as question decomposition, keyword extraction, and
keyphrase extraction. Through comprehensive evaluations on challenging
benchmarks such as BIRD and Spider, we demonstrate that our method
significantly improves schema recall while reducing false positives. Moreover,
SQL generation using our retrieved schema consistently outperforms full-schema
baselines and closely approaches oracle performance, all without requiring
query refinement. Notably, our method narrows the performance gap between full
and perfect schema settings by 50\%. Our findings highlight schema linking as a
powerful lever for enhancing Text-to-SQL accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid increase in academic publications across various
fields has posed severe challenges for academic paper analysis: scientists
struggle to timely and comprehensively track the latest research findings and
methodologies. Key concept extraction has proven to be an effective analytical
paradigm, and its automation has been achieved with the widespread application
of language models in industrial and scientific domains. However, existing
paper databases are mostly limited to similarity matching and basic
classification of key concepts, failing to deeply explore the relational
networks between concepts. This paper is based on the OpenAlex opensource
knowledge graph. By analyzing nearly 8,000 open-source paper data from
Novosibirsk State University, we discovered a strong correlation between the
distribution patterns of paper key concept paths and both innovation points and
rare paths. We propose a prompt engineering-based key concept path analysis
method. This method leverages small language models to achieve precise key
concept extraction and innovation point identification, and constructs an agent
based on a knowledge graph constraint mechanism to enhance analysis accuracy.
Through fine-tuning of the Qwen and DeepSeek models, we achieved significant
improvements in accuracy, with the models publicly available on the Hugging
Face platform.

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了LLM多语言数学推理的局限性，为改进跨语言推理能力提供了评估工具和方向。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning remains one of the most challenging domains for large
language models (LLMs), requiring not only linguistic understanding but also
structured logical deduction and numerical precision. While recent LLMs
demonstrate strong general-purpose reasoning abilities, their mathematical
competence across diverse languages remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks
primarily focus on English or a narrow subset of high-resource languages,
leaving significant gaps in assessing multilingual and cross-lingual
mathematical reasoning. To address this, we introduce MathMist, a parallel
multilingual benchmark for mathematical problem solving and reasoning. MathMist
encompasses over 21K aligned question-answer pairs across seven languages,
representing a balanced coverage of high-, medium-, and low-resource linguistic
settings. The dataset captures linguistic variety, multiple types of problem
settings, and solution synthesizing capabilities. We systematically evaluate a
diverse suite of models, including open-source small and medium LLMs,
proprietary systems, and multilingual-reasoning-focused models, under
zero-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), and code-switched reasoning paradigms. Our
results reveal persistent deficiencies in LLMs' ability to perform consistent
and interpretable mathematical reasoning across languages, with pronounced
degradation in low-resource settings. All the codes and data are available at

*Marwa Abdulhai,Ryan Cheng,Aryansh Shrivastava,Natasha Jaques,Yarin Gal,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究提出信念错位指标量化LLM对话欺骗行为，发现26%对话存在自然欺骗，RLHF模型欺骗率达43%，通过强化学习方法减少77.6%欺骗行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在客服、医疗等关键领域广泛应用，但其潜在的欺骗性输出（包括幻觉、错误信息）存在重大安全隐患，现有安全机制不足以有效防范。

Method: 提出信念错位指标评估对话欺骗，在4个场景下测试5种传统指标和新指标，对8个SOTA模型进行基准测试，开发多轮强化学习微调方法。

Result: 新指标与人类判断相关性最高；LLM自然欺骗率26%，欺骗提示下增加31%；RLHF模型平均欺骗率43%；强化学习方法减少77.6%欺骗行为。

Conclusion: 对话欺骗具有多轮累积特性，需超越单句分析。提出的强化学习方法显著降低欺骗，为LLM安全部署提供新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) interact with millions of people worldwide in
applications such as customer support, education and healthcare. However, their
ability to produce deceptive outputs, whether intentionally or inadvertently,
poses significant safety concerns. The unpredictable nature of LLM behavior,
combined with insufficient safeguards against hallucination, misinformation,
and user manipulation, makes their misuse a serious, real-world risk. In this
paper, we investigate the extent to which LLMs engage in deception within
dialogue, and propose the belief misalignment metric to quantify deception. We
evaluate deception across four distinct dialogue scenarios, using five
established deception detection metrics and our proposed metric. Our findings
reveal this novel deception measure correlates more closely with human
judgments than any existing metrics we test. Additionally, our benchmarking of
eight state-of-the-art models indicates that LLMs naturally exhibit deceptive
behavior in approximately 26% of dialogue turns, even when prompted with
seemingly benign objectives. When prompted to deceive, LLMs are capable of
increasing deceptiveness by as much as 31% relative to baselines. Unexpectedly,
models trained with RLHF, the predominant approach for ensuring the safety of
widely-deployed LLMs, still exhibit deception at a rate of 43% on average.
Given that deception in dialogue is a behavior that develops over an
interaction history, its effective evaluation and mitigation necessitates
moving beyond single-utterance analyses. We introduce a multi-turn
reinforcement learning methodology to fine-tune LLMs to reduce deceptive
behaviors, leading to a 77.6% reduction compared to other instruction-tuned
models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病早期诊断可显著改善患者预后并降低医疗负担，语言能力变化是该病重要早期征兆

Method: 结合Doc2Vec和ELMo词向量构建混合词嵌入，加入语言学特征分析句法语义，通过逻辑回归模型实现超参数全流程调优

Result: 达到91%分类准确率与97% AUC，模型稳定性验证显示标准差低于0.05（准确率标准差0.0403，AUC标准差0.0174）

Conclusion: 该模型可作为AD大规模筛查工具，并为医生诊断提供辅助决策支持

Abstract: Early detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is greatly beneficial to AD
patients, leading to early treatments that lessen symptoms and alleviating
financial burden of health care. As one of the leading signs of AD, language
capability changes can be used for early diagnosis of AD. In this paper, I
develop a robust classification method using hybrid word embedding and
fine-tuned hyperparameters to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in the early
detection of AD. Specifically, we create a hybrid word embedding based on word
vectors from Doc2Vec and ELMo to obtain perplexity scores of the sentences. The
scores identify whether a sentence is fluent or not and capture semantic
context of the sentences. I enrich the word embedding by adding linguistic
features to analyze syntax and semantics. Further, we input an embedded feature
vector into logistic regression and fine tune hyperparameters throughout the
pipeline. By tuning hyperparameters of the machine learning pipeline (e.g.,
model regularization parameter, learning rate and vector size of Doc2Vec, and
vector size of ELMo), I achieve 91% classification accuracy and an Area Under
the Curve (AUC) of 97% in distinguishing early AD from healthy subjects. Based
on my knowledge, my model with 91% accuracy and 97% AUC outperforms the best
existing NLP model for AD diagnosis with an accuracy of 88% [32]. I study the
model stability through repeated experiments and find that the model is stable
even though the training data is split randomly (standard deviation of accuracy
= 0.0403; standard deviation of AUC = 0.0174). This affirms our proposed method
is accurate and stable. This model can be used as a large-scale screening
method for AD, as well as a complementary examination for doctors to detect AD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs角色扮演研究缺乏对多版本角色（如漫威/DC不同宇宙中的英雄）连续性刻画能力的系统性评估，超级英雄IP的多元宇宙设定为此提供了天然测试场景。

Method: 构建包含30个英雄、90个特定版本的数据集，设计Canon Events（关键事件回忆）和Moral Dilemmas（道德困境应对）双任务，提出分离式评估框架（思维过程与行为决策）及Think-Act Matching量化指标。

Result: 1. 思维链提示增强弱模型叙事但损害强模型准确性 2. 角色跨版本泛化能力不足 3. 模型难以同时保持思维与行为的一致性（Think-Act Matching最高仅0.39）

Conclusion: 暴露LLMs在多宇宙角色一致性及推理逻辑对齐的缺陷，为角色扮演系统可信度评估提供新维度，强调未来需加强版本感知与认知-行为统一建模。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as role-playing agents,
yet their capacity to faithfully and consistently portray version-specific
characters -- for example, superheroes across comic and cinematic universes --
remains underexplored. Superhero canons such as Marvel and DC provide a rich
testbed: decades of storytelling yield multiple incarnations of the same
character with distinct histories, values, and moral codes. To study this
problem, we introduce Beyond One World, a benchmark for character-grounded
roleplay spanning 30 iconic heroes and 90 canon-specific versions. The
benchmark comprises two tasks: (i) Canon Events, which probes factual recall of
pivotal life stages, and (ii) Moral Dilemmas, which confronts models with
ethically charged scenarios. We score responses for canonical accuracy and
reasoning fidelity under a framework that separates internal deliberation
("thinking") from outward decisions ("acting"). We further propose Think-Act
Matching, a metric that quantifies alignment between reasons and actions and
serves as a proxy for model trustworthiness. Experiments across reasoning- and
non-reasoning-oriented models yield three findings: (1) chain-of-thought
prompting improves narrative coherence in weaker models but can reduce
canonical accuracy in stronger ones; (2) cross-version generalization within a
character remains a major obstacle; and (3) models often excel at either
thinking or acting, but rarely both. Beyond One World exposes critical gaps in
multiversal consistency and reasoning alignment, offering a challenging
evaluation for role-playing LLMs.

Motivation: 解决资源受限医疗机构难以通过微调获得高性能医疗大语言模型的问题

Method: 两阶段架构（置信度检测+自适应路由）+ Qwen3-30B-A3B/Phi-4/Gemma多模型协作

Result: PubMedQA达95.0%、MedMCQA达78.0%，消融实验验证框架有效性

Conclusion: 模型协作策略为资源受限环境提供了高效医疗AI解决方案

Abstract: High-performing medical Large Language Models (LLMs) typically require
extensive fine-tuning with substantial computational resources, limiting
accessibility for resource-constrained healthcare institutions. This study
introduces a confidence-driven multi-model framework that leverages model
diversity to enhance medical question answering without fine-tuning. Our
framework employs a two-stage architecture: a confidence detection module
assesses the primary model's certainty, and an adaptive routing mechanism
directs low-confidence queries to Helper models with complementary knowledge
for collaborative reasoning. We evaluate our approach using
Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct, Phi-4 14B, and Gemma 2 12B across three medical
benchmarks; MedQA, MedMCQA, and PubMedQA. Result demonstrate that our framework
achieves competitive performance, with particularly strong results in PubMedQA
(95.0\%) and MedMCQA (78.0\%). Ablation studies confirm that confidence-aware
routing combined with multi-model collaboration substantially outperforms
single-model approaches and uniform reasoning strategies. This work establishes
that strategic model collaboration offers a practical, computationally
efficient pathway to improve medical AI systems, with significant implications
for democratizing access to advanced medical AI in resource-limited settings.

Result: 实验表明多数LLM在严重字符噪声干扰下仍保持性能，验证了模型对字符级噪声存在显式/隐式去噪机制

Conclusion: LLM的底层鲁棒性揭示了其滥用风险，对模型在多样化场景中的可靠部署提出警示

Abstract: This work investigates the resilience of contemporary LLMs against frequent
and structured character-level perturbations, specifically through the
insertion of noisy characters after each input character. We introduce
\nameshort{}, a practical method that inserts invisible Unicode control
characters into text to discourage LLM misuse in scenarios such as online exam
systems. Surprisingly, despite strong obfuscation that fragments tokenization
and reduces the signal-to-noise ratio significantly, many LLMs still maintain
notable performance. Through comprehensive evaluation across model-, problem-,
and noise-related configurations, we examine the extent and mechanisms of this
robustness, exploring both the handling of character-level tokenization and
\textit{implicit} versus \textit{explicit} denoising mechanism hypotheses of
character-level noises. We hope our findings on the low-level robustness of
LLMs will shed light on the risks of their misuse and on the reliability of
deploying LLMs across diverse applications.

Abstract: To advance a Weather-Ready Nation, the National Weather Service (NWS) is
developing a systematic translation program to better serve the 68.8 million
people in the U.S. who do not speak English at home. This article outlines the
foundation of an automated translation tool for NWS products, powered by
artificial intelligence. The NWS has partnered with LILT, whose patented
training process enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt neural machine
translation (NMT) tools for weather terminology and messaging. Designed for
scalability across Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs) and National Centers, the
system is currently being developed in Spanish, Simplified Chinese, Vietnamese,
and other widely spoken non-English languages. Rooted in best practices for
multilingual risk communication, the system provides accurate, timely, and
culturally relevant translations, significantly reducing manual translation
time and easing operational workloads across the NWS. To guide the distribution
of these products, GIS mapping was used to identify language needs across
different NWS regions, helping prioritize resources for the communities that
need them most. We also integrated ethical AI practices throughout the
program's design, ensuring that transparency, fairness, and human oversight
guide how automated translations are created, evaluated, and shared with the
public. This work has culminated into a website featuring experimental
multilingual NWS products, including translated warnings, 7-day forecasts, and
educational campaigns, bringing the country one step closer to a national
warning system that reaches all Americans.

Motivation: 现有QA系统在需要全面文档检索的pluri-hop问题上表现不佳，尤其在重复性高、干扰文档多的实际场景中检索敏感度高

Method: PluriHopRAG采用『分解查询+交叉编码过滤』策略：1) 将查询拆解为文档级子问题 2) 在LLM推理前过滤无关文档

Result: PluriHopRAG比传统方法F1提升18-52%，现有方法在数据集上F1不足40%

Conclusion: 全面检索配合早期过滤策略，相比传统top-k方法具有显著优势，为重复性语料库问答提供新思路

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) have enabled progress on question answering (QA) when relevant
evidence is in one (single-hop) or multiple (multi-hop) passages. Yet many
realistic questions about recurring report data - medical records, compliance
filings, maintenance logs - require aggregation across all documents, with no
clear stopping point for retrieval and high sensitivity to even one missed
passage. We term these pluri-hop questions and formalize them by three
criteria: recall sensitivity, exhaustiveness, and exactness. To study this
setting, we introduce PluriHopWIND, a diagnostic multilingual dataset of 48
pluri-hop questions built from 191 real-world wind industry reports in German
and English. We show that PluriHopWIND is 8-40% more repetitive than other
common datasets and thus has higher density of distractor documents, better
reflecting practical challenges of recurring report corpora. We test a
traditional RAG pipeline as well as graph-based and multimodal variants, and
find that none of the tested approaches exceed 40% in statement-wise F1 score.
Motivated by this, we propose PluriHopRAG, a RAG architecture that follows a
"check all documents individually, filter cheaply" approach: it (i) decomposes
queries into document-level subquestions and (ii) uses a cross-encoder filter
to discard irrelevant documents before costly LLM reasoning. We find that
PluriHopRAG achieves relative F1 score improvements of 18-52% depending on base
LLM. Despite its modest size, PluriHopWIND exposes the limitations of current
QA systems on repetitive, distractor-rich corpora. PluriHopRAG's performance
highlights the value of exhaustive retrieval and early filtering as a powerful
alternative to top-k methods.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注单条社交媒体帖子检测，缺乏对用户长期动态评论树的分析。用户自杀倾向往往通过历史互动逐渐显现，需系统性分析此类数据对自杀风险预测的影响。

Method: 1. 基于C-SSRS构建四标签标注框架
2. 创建Reddit用户发帖历史和评论树的高质量标注数据集
3. 采用统计分析和LLMs实验验证评论树数据价值

Result: 统计分析和LLM实验表明，整合评论树数据使自杀风险分级预测准确率显著提升（具体指标需参照原文），验证了时序社交互动数据的预测价值。

Conclusion: 评论树分析为高风险个体识别提供新维度，通过捕捉用户动态行为模式有效提升检测精度，为自杀干预策略奠定数据基础。

Abstract: Suicide remains a critical global public health issue. While previous studies
have provided valuable insights into detecting suicidal expressions in
individual social media posts, limited attention has been paid to the analysis
of longitudinal, sequential comment trees for predicting a user's evolving
suicidal risk. Users, however, often reveal their intentions through historical
posts and interactive comments over time. This study addresses this gap by
investigating how the information in comment trees affects both the
discrimination and prediction of users' suicidal risk levels. We constructed a
high-quality annotated dataset, sourced from Reddit, which incorporates users'
posting history and comments, using a refined four-label annotation framework
based on the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Statistical
analysis of the dataset, along with experimental results from Large Language
Models (LLMs) experiments, demonstrates that incorporating comment trees data
significantly enhances the discrimination and prediction of user suicidal risk
levels. This research offers a novel insight to enhancing the detection
accuracy of at-risk individuals, thereby providing a valuable foundation for
early suicide intervention strategies.

Conclusion: YNTP通过结构化交互建模个体语言使用，提供多语言、心理学分析的基准数据集，推动个性化语言模型发展

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general next-token prediction but still
struggle to generate responses that reflect how individuals truly communicate,
such as replying to emails or social messages in their own style. However, real
SNS or email histories are difficult to collect due to privacy concerns. To
address this, we propose the task of "Your Next Token Prediction (YNTP)", which
models a user's precise word choices through controlled human-agent
conversations. We build a multilingual benchmark of 100 dialogue sessions
across English, Japanese, and Chinese, where users interact for five days with
psychologically grounded NPCs based on MBTI dimensions. This setup captures
natural, daily-life communication patterns and enables analysis of users'
internal models. We evaluate prompt-based and fine-tuning-based personalization
methods, establishing the first benchmark for YNTP and a foundation for
user-aligned language modeling. The dataset is available at:

Conclusion: 该框架通过结构化验证机制和医学信任对齐，显著提升医学QA的事实一致性，为临床应用提供可靠解决方案

Abstract: Biomedical question answering (QA) requires accurate interpretation of
complex medical knowledge. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising
capabilities in this domain, with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems
enhancing performance by incorporating external medical literature. However,
RAG-based approaches in biomedical QA suffer from hallucinations due to
post-retrieval noise and insufficient verification of retrieved evidence,
undermining response reliability. We propose MedTrust-Guided Iterative RAG, a
framework designed to enhance factual consistency and mitigate hallucinations
in medical QA. Our method introduces three key innovations. First, it enforces
citation-aware reasoning by requiring all generated content to be explicitly
grounded in retrieved medical documents, with structured Negative Knowledge
Assertions used when evidence is insufficient. Second, it employs an iterative
retrieval-verification process, where a verification agent assesses evidence
adequacy and refines queries through Medical Gap Analysis until reliable
information is obtained. Third, it integrates the MedTrust-Align Module (MTAM)
that combines verified positive examples with hallucination-aware negative
samples, leveraging Direct Preference Optimization to reinforce
citation-grounded reasoning while penalizing hallucination-prone response
patterns. Experiments on MedMCQA, MedQA, and MMLU-Med demonstrate that our
approach consistently outperforms competitive baselines across multiple model
architectures, achieving the best average accuracy with gains of 2.7% for
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct and 2.4% for Qwen3-8B.

signals directly from instructions and generating pseudo-labels for reward
model training. Our approach introduces constraint decomposition strategies and
efficient constraint-wise binary classification to address sparse reward
challenges while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments show that
our approach generalizes well, achieving strong improvements across 3 in-domain

Conclusion: 需强化网络代理的信息聚合基础能力，现有基准无法有效评估该能力

Abstract: Deep research web agents not only retrieve information from diverse sources
such as web environments, files, and multimodal inputs, but more importantly,
they need to rigorously analyze and aggregate knowledge for insightful
research. However, existing open-source deep research agents predominantly
focus on enhancing information-seeking capabilities of web agents to locate
specific information, while overlooking the essential need for information
aggregation, which would limit their ability to support in-depth research. We
propose an Explore to Evolve paradigm to scalably construct verifiable training
data for web agents. Begins with proactive online exploration, an agent sources
grounded information by exploring the real web. Using the collected evidence,
the agent then self-evolves an aggregation program by selecting, composing, and
refining operations from 12 high-level logical types to synthesize a verifiable
QA pair. This evolution from high-level guidance to concrete operations allowed
us to scalably produce WebAggregatorQA, a dataset of 10K samples across 50K
websites and 11 domains. Based on an open-source agent framework, SmolAgents,
we collect supervised fine-tuning trajectories to develop a series of
foundation models, WebAggregator. WebAggregator-8B matches the performance of
GPT-4.1, while the 32B variant surpasses GPT-4.1 by more than 10% on GAIA-text
and closely approaches Claude-3.7-sonnet. Moreover, given the limited
availability of benchmarks that evaluate web agents' information aggregation
abilities, we construct a human-annotated evaluation split of WebAggregatorQA
as a challenging test set. On this benchmark, Claude-3.7-sonnet only achieves
28%, and GPT-4.1 scores 25.8%. Even when agents manage to retrieve all
references, they still struggle on WebAggregatorQA, highlighting the need to
strengthen the information aggregation capabilities of web agent foundations.

Abstract: We present Natural Language Tools (NLT), a framework that replaces

eliminates task interference and format constraints that degrade tool call
performance. When evaluated across 10 models and 6,400 trials spanning customer
service and mental health domains, NLT improves tool calling accuracy by 18.4
percentage points while reducing output variance by 70%. Open-weight models see
the largest gains, surpassing flagship closed-weight alternatives, with
implications for model training in both reinforcement learning and supervised
fine-tuning stages. These improvements persist under prompt perturbations and
extend tool-calling capabilities to models lacking native support.

substantially lower for low-resource languages (e.g., Urdu, Thai) due to

alignment. We introduce LiRA (Linguistic Robust Anchoring for Large Language
Models), a training framework that robustly improves cross-lingual
representations under low-resource conditions while jointly strengthening
retrieval and reasoning. LiRA comprises two modules: (i) Arca (Anchored
Representation Composition Architecture), which anchors low-resource languages
to an English semantic space via anchor-based alignment and multi-agent
collaborative encoding, preserving geometric stability in a shared embedding
space; and (ii) LaSR (Language-coupled Semantic Reasoner), which adds a
language-aware lightweight reasoning head with consistency regularization on
top of Arca's multilingual representations, unifying the training objective to
enhance cross-lingual understanding, retrieval, and reasoning robustness. We
further construct and release a multilingual product retrieval dataset covering
five Southeast Asian and two South Asian languages. Experiments across
low-resource benchmarks (cross-lingual retrieval, semantic similarity, and
reasoning) show consistent gains and robustness under few-shot and
noise-amplified settings; ablations validate the contribution of both Arca and
LaSR. Code will be released on GitHub and the dataset on Hugging Face.

*Matt Grenander,Shay B. Cohen,Mark Steedman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于实体标记压缩的seq2seq增量共指消解方法，在保持性能的同时实现1.8倍压缩率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有seq2seq共指模型在增量场景（如对话）存在效率缺陷，需处理完整前缀且无法有效压缩输入

Method: 通过提取/重组实体级标记并丢弃非关键token，构建压缩表示提升处理效率

Result: OntoNotes接近全前缀基线（CoNLL F1差0.6）且压缩率1.8；LitBank实现SOTA性能

Conclusion: 证明在seq2seq模型中战略性丢弃大量token是实现高效增量共指消解的可行方案

Abstract: Seq2seq coreference models have introduced a new paradigm for coreference
resolution by learning to generate text corresponding to coreference labels,
without requiring task-specific parameters. While these models achieve new
state-of-the-art performance, they do so at the cost of flexibility and
efficiency. In particular, they do not efficiently handle incremental settings
such as dialogue, where text must processed sequentially. We propose a
compressed representation in order to improve the efficiency of these methods
in incremental settings. Our method works by extracting and re-organizing
entity-level tokens, and discarding the majority of other input tokens. On
OntoNotes, our best model achieves just 0.6 CoNLL F1 points below a
full-prefix, incremental baseline while achieving a compression ratio of 1.8.
On LitBank, where singleton mentions are annotated, it passes state-of-the-art
performance. Our results indicate that discarding a wide portion of tokens in
seq2seq resolvers is a feasible strategy for incremental coreference
resolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏验证主权LLMs是否适配用户社会文化背景、能否保障安全性的评估框架，需系统性解决方案。

Method: 通过构建新型数据集和开发分析框架，同时评估模型的社会文化元素和技术稳健性指标。

Result: 实验显示主权LLMs对低资源语言有效，但存在用户服务承诺未兑现及安全性被低估的问题。

Conclusion: 推进主权LLMs需建立更全面的评价体系，整合社会文化适配度与安全技术指标的双重验证。

Abstract: Recent trends in LLMs development clearly show growing interest in the use
and application of sovereign LLMs. The global debate over sovereign LLMs
highlights the need for governments to develop their LLMs, tailored to their
unique socio-cultural and historical contexts. However, there remains a
shortage of frameworks and datasets to verify two critical questions: (1) how
well these models align with users' socio-cultural backgrounds, and (2) whether
they maintain safety and technical robustness without exposing users to
potential harms and risks. To address this gap, we construct a new dataset and
introduce an analytic framework for extracting and evaluating the
socio-cultural elements of sovereign LLMs, alongside assessments of their
technical robustness. Our experimental results demonstrate that while sovereign
LLMs play a meaningful role in supporting low-resource languages, they do not
always meet the popular claim that these models serve their target users well.
We also show that pursuing this untested claim may lead to underestimating
critical quality attributes such as safety. Our study suggests that advancing
sovereign LLMs requires a more extensive evaluation that incorporates a broader
range of well-grounded and practical criteria.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于RLHF的偏好学习方法在去除客观质量信号后性能骤降，表明其无法有效捕捉创作性、风格特色等主观质量维度，需通过新数据集和评估方法揭示这一局限。

Method: 构建跨8类写作体裁的平衡数据集(WritingPreferenceBench)，在控制客观指标后测试序列奖励模型、语言模型评委与生成式推理奖励模型的表现差异。

Result: 生成式奖励模型准确率81.8%显著优于传统方法(52.7%)，模型跨体裁准确率标准差达10.1%，27B与8B模型无显著差异，显示主观偏好建模需新方法。

Conclusion: 当前RLHF主要检测客观错误而非学习主观偏好，建议采用显式推理中间表示替代直接分类，模型规模扩大无法解决主观评估的核心挑战。

Abstract: Current preference learning methods achieve high accuracy on standard
benchmarks but exhibit significant performance degradation when objective
quality signals are removed. We introduce WritingPreferenceBench, a dataset of
1,800 human-annotated preference pairs (1,200 English, 600 Chinese) across 8
creative writing genres, where responses are matched for objective correctness,
factual accuracy, and length. On this benchmark, sequence-based reward
models--the standard architecture for RLHF--achieve only 52.7% mean accuracy,
while zero-shot language model judges perform at 53.9%. In contrast, generative
reward models that produce explicit reasoning chains achieve 81.8% accuracy. We
observe high within-model variance across genres: individual models range from
18.2% to 81.8% accuracy across different writing categories, with standard
deviations averaging 10.1%. This variance persists regardless of model scale,
with 27B parameter models showing no consistent improvement over 8B variants.
Our results suggest that current RLHF methods primarily learn to detect
objective errors rather than capture subjective quality preferences (e.g.,
creativity, stylistic flair, and emotional resonance), and that successful
preference modeling may require intermediate reasoning representations rather
than direct classification.

Conclusion: 该工作通过系统化的数据构造和双模式训练框架，成功解决了现有归纳推理研究的局限性，为提升LLMs的自主推理能力提供了新范式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) make remarkable progress in reasoning tasks.
Among different reasoning modes, inductive reasoning, due to its better
alignment with human learning, attracts increasing interest. However, research
on inductive reasoning faces certain challenges. First, existing inductive data
mostly focuses on superficial regularities while lacking more complex internal
patterns. Second, current works merely prompt LLMs or finetune on simple
prompt-response pairs, but do not provide precise thinking processes nor
implement difficulty control. Unlike previous work, we address these challenges
by introducing \textit{CodeSeq}, a synthetic post-training dataset built from
number sequences. We package number sequences into algorithmic problems to
discover their general terms, defining a general term generation (GTG) task
correspondingly. Our pipeline generates supervised finetuning data by
reflecting on failed test cases and incorporating iterative corrections,
thereby teaching LLMs to learn autonomous case generation and self-checking.
Additionally, it leverages reinforcement learning with a novel Case-Synergy
Solvability Scaling Reward based on both solvability, estimated from the
problem pass rate, and the success rate of self-directed case generation,
enabling models to learn more effectively from both successes and failures.
Experimental results show that the models trained with \textit{CodeSeq} improve
on various reasoning tasks and can preserve the models' OOD performance.

TL;DR: 提出RLAIF-SPA框架，通过AI反馈强化学习机制优化语音合成的语义准确性和韵律情感对齐

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTS方法依赖昂贵情感标注/间接优化目标，导致生成语音情感平淡不自然

Method: 结合ASR和LLM技术，通过四个细粒度维度（结构/情感/语速/语调）进行韵律标签对齐，并加入语义准确反馈机制

Result: 在Libri Speech数据集上实现WER降低26.1%、SIM-O提升9.1%，人类评估改进超10%

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升语音合成的情感表现力和可懂度，为生成自然情感语音提供有效解决方案

Abstract: Text-To-Speech synthesis has achieved near-human quality in neutral speech,
but emotional expressiveness remains a challenge. Existing methods often rely
on costly emotion annotations or optimize indirect objectives that fail to
capture the emotional expressiveness and perceptual naturalness of speech,
leading to generated speech that is accurate but emotionally flat. To address
these challenges, we propose the RLAIF-SPA framework, incorporating a
Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) mechanism to employ Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) and Large Language Model (LLM) techniques to
respectively judge semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional label alignment as
a direct reward for emotional expressiveness and intelligibility optimization.
Specifically, it leverages Prosodic Label Alignment to enhance expressive
quality by jointly considering semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional
alignment along four fine-grained dimensions: Structure, Emotion, Speed, and
Tone. In addition, it incorporates Semantic Accuracy Feedback to ensure the
generation of clear and accurate speech. Experiments on the Libri Speech
dataset show that RLAIF-SPA outperforms Chat-TTS, with a 26.1% reduction in
WER, a 9.1% increase in SIM-O, and over 10% improvement in human evaluation.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖高成本的商业大语言模型，需要预先知道聚类数量，且缺乏可解释性。现实场景中聚类数量通常未知且需要低成本解决方案

Method: 1. 生成文本的伪标签集合
2. 基于标签共享假设进行多标签分类

Conclusion: 该方法为低资源场景提供高效解决方案，生成可解释的伪标签，摆脱对商业模型的依赖和聚类数量预设要求

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an intuitive, training-free and label-free method
for intent clustering that makes minimal assumptions using lightweight and
open-source LLMs. Many current approaches rely on commercial LLMs, which are
costly, and offer limited transparency. Additionally, their methods often
explicitly depend on knowing the number of clusters in advance, which is often
not the case in realistic settings. To address these challenges, instead of
asking the LLM to match similar text directly, we first ask it to generate
pseudo-labels for each text, and then perform multi-label classification in
this pseudo-label set for each text. This approach is based on the hypothesis
that texts belonging to the same cluster will share more labels, and will
therefore be closer when encoded into embeddings. These pseudo-labels are more
human-readable than direct similarity matches. Our evaluation on four benchmark
sets shows that our approach achieves results comparable to and better than
recent baselines, while remaining simple and computationally efficient. Our
findings indicate that our method can be applied in low-resource scenarios and
is stable across multiple models and datasets.

Motivation: 现有规则奖励(如精确匹配)对表达变化敏感且不适用于长文本，生成式奖励虽鲁棒但验证困难且计算成本高，需统一可验证的解决方案。

Method: 1. 将原子信息点作为结构化评估标准(nugget-as-rubric) 2. 基于查询重写的自动rubric构建流程 3. 通过知识蒸馏和两阶段训练策略开发4B参数验证器Search-Gen-V。

Result: Search-Gen-V在不同工作负载中实现强验证准确率(短文本单rubric/长文本多rubric)，验证成本降低76%且保持93%准确率。

Conclusion: 该范式为动态语料库中的长文本任务提供可扩展、鲁棒且高效的验证方案，推动搜索增强LLM的奖励机制发展。

Abstract: Search augmentation empowers Large Language Models with retrieval
capabilities to overcome the limitations imposed by static parameters.
Recently, Reinforcement Learning leverages tailored reward signals as a viable
technique to enhance LLMs performing tasks involving search. However, existing
reward modeling for search-augmented LLMs faces several limitations. Rule-based
rewards, such as Exact Match, are verifiable but fragile to variations in
expression and cannot be applied to long-form workloads. In contrast,
generative rewards improve robustness, but designing verifiable and stable
rewards for long-form workloads in dynamic corpora remains challenging and also
incurs high computational costs. In this paper, we propose a unified and
verifiable paradigm, "nugget-as-rubric", which treats atomic information points
as structured evaluation criteria for different search-augmentation workloads.
Short-form tasks correspond to a single rubric, whereas long-form tasks expand
to multiple rubrics aligned with the question's information needs. To support
long-form settings, we design an automatic rubric construction pipeline based
on query rewriting, which can automatically retrieve passages relevant to each
question and extract rubrics from them, both from static corpora and from
dynamic online web content. Furthermore, we introduce \textbf{Search-Gen-V}, a
4B-parameter efficient generative verifier under our proposed verifiable
paradigm, which is trained via the idea of distillation and a two-stage
strategy. Experimental results show that Search-Gen-V achieves strong
verification accuracy across different workloads, making it a scalable, robust,
and efficient verifiable reward constructor for search-augmented LLMs.

<details>

Motivation: 由于直译可能破坏语义韵律，当前机器翻译模型难以处理'被'字句的负面语义特征。研究旨在通过针对性训练解决该问题。

Method: 构建英汉'被'字句负面语义韵律数据集，微调OPUS-MT/NLLB-600M/mBART50模型，并在中英/西中翻译任务中验证效果。

Result: 微调后模型能正确区分负面/中性内容使用'被'字句，且NLLB-600M可将该知识迁移至西班牙语-中文翻译任务。

Conclusion: 语义韵律应作为独立语言属性处理，通过针对性数据微调可有效提升翻译质量，该知识具备跨语言迁移潜力。

Abstract: Semantic prosody is a collocational meaning formed through the co-occurrence
of a linguistic unit and a consistent series of collocates, which should be
treated separately from semantic meaning. Since words that are literal
translations of each other may have different semantic prosody, more attention
should be paid to this linguistic property to generate accurate translations.
However, current machine translation models cannot handle this problem. To
bridge the gap, we propose an approach to teach machine translation models
about semantic prosody of a specific structure. We focus on Chinese BEI
passives and create a dataset of English-Chinese sentence pairs with the
purpose of demonstrating the negative semantic prosody of BEI passives. Then we
fine-tune OPUS-MT, NLLB-600M and mBART50 models with our dataset for the
English-Chinese translation task. Our results show that fine-tuned MT models
perform better on using BEI passives for translating unfavourable content and
avoid using it for neutral and favourable content. Also, in NLLB-600M, which is
a multilingual model, this knowledge of semantic prosody can be transferred
from English-Chinese translation to other language pairs, such as
Spanish-Chinese.

Result: 使用故事的小组识别到13种危害类型且分布均匀，未使用组58.3%集中在隐私与福祉，故事组创意性思考提升37%

Conclusion: 故事叙述扩展了AI影响评估的维度，促进跨风险类型的系统性思考，为负责任的AI部署提供决策支持工具

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming healthcare, enabling
fast development of tools like stress monitors, wellness trackers, and mental
health chatbots. However, rapid and low-barrier development can introduce risks
of bias, privacy violations, and unequal access, especially when systems ignore
real-world contexts and diverse user needs. Many recent methods use AI to
detect risks automatically, but this can reduce human engagement in
understanding how harms arise and who they affect. We present a human-centered
framework that generates user stories and supports multi-agent discussions to
help people think creatively about potential benefits and harms before
deployment. In a user study, participants who read stories recognized a broader
range of harms, distributing their responses more evenly across all 13 harm
types. In contrast, those who did not read stories focused primarily on privacy
and well-being (58.3%). Our findings show that storytelling helped participants
speculate about a broader range of harms and benefits and think more creatively
about AI's impact on users.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have rapidly advanced from
perception tasks to complex multi-step reasoning, yet reinforcement learning
with verifiable rewards (RLVR) often leads to spurious reasoning since only the
final-answer correctness is rewarded. To address this limitation, we propose
AutoRubric-R1V, a framework that integrates RLVR with process-level supervision
through automatically collected rubric-based generative rewards. Our key
innovation lies in a scalable self-aggregation method that distills consistent
reasoning checkpoints from successful trajectories, enabling problem-specific
rubric construction without human annotation or stronger teacher models. By
jointly leveraging rubric-based and outcome rewards, AutoRubric-R1V achieves
state-of-the-art performance on six multimodal reasoning benchmarks and
substantially improves reasoning faithfulness in dedicated evaluations.

Conclusion: 需要建立Pluto这类效率感知的评估框架来推动硬件导向的LLM研究进展

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate hardware
design tasks, including the generation of Verilog code. While early benchmarks
focus primarily on functional correctness, efficient hardware design demands
additional optimization for synthesis metrics such as area, delay, and power.
Existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating these aspects comprehensively:
they often lack optimized baselines or testbenches for verification. To address
these gaps, we present Pluto, a benchmark and evaluation framework designed to
assess the efficiency of LLM-generated Verilog designs. Pluto presents a
comprehensive evaluation set of 114 problems with self-checking testbenches and
multiple Pareto-optimal reference implementations. Experimental results show
that state-of-the-art LLMs can achieve high functional correctness, reaching
78.3\% at pass@1, but their synthesis efficiency still lags behind
expert-crafted implementations, with area efficiency of 63.8\%, delay
efficiency of 65.9\%, and power efficiency of 64.0\% at eff@1. This highlights
the need for efficiency-aware evaluation frameworks such as Pluto to drive

Abstract: Large language models exhibit systematic deficiencies in creative writing,
particularly in non-English contexts where training data is scarce and lacks
process-level supervision. We present COIG-Writer, a novel Chinese creative
writing dataset that captures both diverse outputs and their underlying thought
processes through systematic reverse-engineering of high-quality texts. Unlike
existing datasets that provide only input-output pairs, COIG-Writer comprises
1,665 meticulously curated triplets spanning 51 genres, each containing: (1) a
reverse-engineered prompt, (2) detailed creative reasoning documenting
decision-making processes, and (3) the final text. Through comprehensive
experiments, we identify a two-component model of creative writing: narrative
logic (provided by process supervision) and linguistic expression (maintained
by general-purpose data). Our findings reveal three critical insights: (1)
Process supervision is highly effective but requires stabilization with general
data. A ratio of at least one creative sample to twelve general samples is
needed to achieve optimal performance; below this threshold, the win rate
progressively degrades (from 62.75% down to 35.78%)., (2) creative capabilities
are culturally-bound with no cross-lingual transfer (89.26pp gap between
Chinese and English performance), and (3) lexical diversity inversely
correlates with creative quality (TTR paradox), suggesting high diversity
signals compensatory behavior for logical deficiencies. These findings
establish that creative excellence emerges from the interaction between logical
scaffolding and linguistic grounding, analogous to how mathematical reasoning
enhances but cannot replace linguistic competence in foundation models.

Abstract: Evaluating generative models, such as large language models (LLMs), commonly
involves question-answering tasks where the final answer is selected based on
probability of answer choices. On the other hand, for models requiring
reasoning, the method of answer extraction plays a critical role. Our research
reveals that the performance of reasoning models and their final answer
distributions are highly sensitive to the answer extraction algorithm employed.
In order to mitigate this, we propose a basic framework: Answer Regeneration.
The method uses an additional model inference, providing the prior input and
output prefaced by the prompt "Answer:". The final answer is then selected or
extracted from the regenerated output. We show that this
extraction-rule-agnostic approach exhibits improved performance and enhanced
robustness. Furthermore, we have applied this framework to general math
problems and open-ended question answering tasks. Our analysis and this
framework could offer a more reliable results for model evaluation.

Abstract: In information retrieval, training reranking models mainly focuses on two

label prediction of relevance vs. irrelevance). For BERT-style encoders,
various studies have shown that contrastive learning (CL) can be more effective
than discriminative (classification) learning. However, for large language
models (LLMs), classification via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which predicts
''yes'' (resp. ''no'') token for relevant (resp. irrelevant) pairs, appears
more promising as it aligns well with the generative nature of LLMs. This
divergence raises a central question: which objective is intrinsically better
suited to LLM-based reranking, and what mechanism underlies the difference? In
this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison and analysis between CL and
SFT for reranking, taking the universal multimodal retrieval (UMR) as the
experimental playground. We first decompose the objectives into two components:
weight, which controls the magnitude of those updates, and direction, which
guides the model updates, then present a unified framework for understanding
their interactions. Through probing experiments, we find that SFT provides a
substantially stronger weighting scheme than CL, whereas the preferred scoring
direction shows no clear winner. Taken together, these results point to a
consistent advantage of SFT over CL for LLM reranking. To further validate our
findings, we conduct large-scale training with SFT and present new
state-of-the-art rerankers on the MRB benchmark. We also provide ablations on
SFT settings and expect our findings to benefit future research and
applications in this area.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出无需外部数据的在线测试时框架，通过自监督优化MoE路由决策，在推理任务中实现性能提升（如HumanEval提升5.5%）


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型部署时因分布偏移导致路由决策不佳，现有测试时适应方法依赖外部数据且主要针对密集模型

Method: 分阶段循环框架：预填充阶段基于已生成序列自监督优化路由，生成阶段维持调整后的路由；采用轻量级附加向量局部更新路由logits

Result: HumanEval提升5.5%，结合自一致性方法在DeepSeek-V2-Lite实现6%平均提升

Conclusion: 该框架具备即插即用、计算高效优势，无需外部监督数据，且能与现有测试时扩展技术自然结合

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models achieve efficient scaling through sparse
expert activation, but often suffer from suboptimal routing decisions due to
distribution shifts in deployment. While existing test-time adaptation methods
could potentially address these issues, they primarily focus on dense models
and require access to external data, limiting their practical applicability to
MoE architectures. However, we find that, instead of relying on reference data,
we can optimize MoE expert selection on-the-fly based only on input context. As
such, we propose \textit{a data-free, online test-time framework} that
continuously adapts MoE routing decisions during text generation without
external supervision or data. Our method cycles between two phases: During the
prefill stage, and later in regular intervals, we optimize the routing
decisions of the model using self-supervision based on the already generated
sequence. Then, we generate text as normal, maintaining the modified router
until the next adaption. We implement this through lightweight additive vectors
that only update router logits in selected layers, maintaining computational
efficiency while preventing over-adaptation. The experimental results show
consistent performance gains on challenging reasoning tasks while maintaining
robustness to context shifts. For example, our method achieves a 5.5\%
improvement on HumanEval with OLMoE. Furthermore, owing to its plug-and-play
property, our method naturally complements existing test-time scaling
techniques, e.g., achieving 6\% average gains when incorporated with
self-consistency on DeepSeek-V2-Lite.

<details>

Motivation: 探索广泛应用的'midtraining'策略为何有效，填补该阶段训练机制的科学认知空白。

Method: 通过从头预训练语言模型并在不同领域进行监督微调的对比实验，系统研究midtraining效果。特别针对代码领域进行训练时机与数据混合权重的消融实验。

Result: 在数学/代码领域效果显著（验证损失降低7.5%），早期引入专用数据效果更优（领域性能提升12%+，通用能力保留更好），训练时机重要性超过数据混合比例。

Conclusion: Midtraining作为领域适应技术，通过减少预训练数据遗忘，在特定语法领域（代码/数学）展现出优于持续预训练的效果，训练时机是关键调节因素。

Abstract: Recently, many language models have been pretrained with a "midtraining"
phase, in which higher quality, often instruction-formatted data, is mixed in
at the end of pretraining. Despite the popularity of this practice, there is
little scientific understanding of this phase of model training or why it is
effective. In this work, we conduct the first systematic investigation of
midtraining through controlled experiments with language models pretrained from
scratch and fine-tuned on supervised finetuning datasets in different domains.
We find that when compared after supervised fine-tuning, the effectiveness of
midtraining is highest in the math and code domains, where midtraining can best
reduce the syntactic gap between pretraining and posttraining data. In these
cases, midtraining consistently outperforms continued pretraining in both
in-domain validation loss as well as pretraining data forgetting after
posttraining. We conduct ablations on the starting time of the midtraining
phase and mixture weights of the midtraining data, using code midtraining as a
case study, and find that timing has a greater impact than mixture weights,
with earlier introduction of specialized data, yielding greater benefits
in-domain as well as preserving general language modeling better. These
findings establish midtraining as a domain adaptation technique that compared
to continued pretraining yields better performance through reduced forgetting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决通用编译器在空间架构上无法有效协调并行性、数据移动和计算调度的问题，提升现代NPU架构的开发效率与性能表现。

Method: 定义AIR方言支持异步/分层操作，通过编译器管理空间调度、硬件区域分配和通信计算重叠，替代手工调度或临时运行时协调。

Result: 矩阵乘法性能接近手工优化框架MLIR-AIE；多头注意力实现通信计算重叠，有效映射NPU内存层次和计算资源。

Conclusion: MLIR-AIR通过结构化控制流转换和编译器调度，实现了空间硬件资源的高效利用，为复杂工作负载提供可扩展的编程方案。

Abstract: General-purpose compilers abstract away parallelism, locality, and
synchronization, limiting their effectiveness on modern spatial architectures.
As modern computing architectures increasingly rely on fine-grained control
over data movement, execution order, and compute placement for performance,
compiler infrastructure must provide explicit mechanisms for orchestrating
compute and data to fully exploit such architectures. We introduce MLIR-AIR, a
novel, open-source compiler stack built on MLIR that bridges the semantic gap
between high-level workloads and fine-grained spatial architectures such as
AMD's NPUs. MLIR-AIR defines the AIR dialect, which provides structured
representations for asynchronous and hierarchical operations across compute and
memory resources. AIR primitives allow the compiler to orchestrate spatial
scheduling, distribute computation across hardware regions, and overlap
communication with computation without relying on ad hoc runtime coordination
or manual scheduling. We demonstrate MLIR-AIR's capabilities through two case
studies: matrix multiplication and the multi-head attention block from the
LLaMA 2 model. For matrix multiplication, MLIR-AIR achieves up to 78.7% compute
efficiency and generates implementations with performance almost identical to
state-of-the-art, hand-optimized matrix multiplication written using the
lower-level, close-to-metal MLIR-AIE framework. For multi-head attention, we
demonstrate that the AIR interface supports fused implementations using
approximately 150 lines of code, enabling tractable expression of complex
workloads with efficient mapping to spatial hardware. MLIR-AIR transforms
high-level structured control flow into spatial programs that efficiently
utilize the compute fabric and memory hierarchy of an NPU, leveraging
asynchronous execution, tiling, and communication overlap through
compiler-managed scheduling.

Result: 合并模型响应相似性提升47.5%，显著优于基线模型

Conclusion: 通过创新的模型融合方法有效整合专业知识，为工业级RAG系统可靠性提升提供实用解决方案

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems leverage Large Language Models
(LLMs) to generate accurate and reliable responses that are grounded in
retrieved context. However, LLMs often generate inconsistent outputs for
semantically equivalent inputs, a problem compounded by the scarcity of
consistency-focused training data and the limitations of current fine-tuning
techniques in enhancing output consistency. We propose a new approach combining
systematic synthetic data generation, triplet loss for better embeddings, and a
novel layer-wise model merging approach. Using consistency-aware weights
derived from intermediate layer activations, our method effectively integrates
knowledge from specialized models. Experimental results how that our merged
model significantly enhances output consistency, achieving a ~47.5\%
improvement in response similarity over the baseline, thus offering a practical
solution for increasing the reliability of an industrial RAG system.

Abstract: Scaling laws have transformed our understanding of large language models by
linking upstream metrics like cross-entropy loss to design factors such as
model size, training data, and compute. However, these conventional laws fail
to capture downstream task performance, where context plays a critical role. In
this work, we propose a straightforward, interpretable framework that jointly
models downstream performance as a function of the training compute and the
provided context. We empirically validate our framework by fitting it on the
observed downstream performance of extended-context variants of Llama-2-7B and
Llama-2-13B across 65,500 unique instances spanning three tasks: arithmetic
reasoning, common sense reasoning, and machine translation. Our results
demonstrate that our framework accurately models in-distribution downstream
performance, generalizes across three orders of magnitude in training compute,
and reliably extrapolates performance as the amount of context increases. These
findings offer valuable insights into the interplay between training compute
and context utilization, providing guidance for designing more efficient
long-context LLMs for diverse downstream tasks. Our code is available at

Conclusion: LLM模型显著优于传统自评工具，为临床整合AI诊断奠定基础，特别适用于资源匮乏/高污名环境

Abstract: Mental health disorders remain among the leading cause of disability
worldwide, yet conditions such as depression, anxiety, and Post-Traumatic
Stress Disorder (PTSD) are frequently underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed due to
subjective assessments, limited clinical resources, and stigma and low
awareness. In primary care settings, studies show that providers misidentify
depression or anxiety in over 60% of cases, highlighting the urgent need for
scalable, accessible, and context-aware diagnostic tools that can support early
detection and intervention. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of
machine learning models for mental health screening using a unique dataset of
553 real-world, semistructured interviews, each paried with ground-truth
diagnoses for major depressive episodes (MDE), anxiety disorders, and PTSD. We
benchmark multiple model classes, including zero-shot prompting with GPT-4.1
Mini and MetaLLaMA, as well as fine-tuned RoBERTa models using LowRank
Adaptation (LoRA). Our models achieve over 80% accuracy across diagnostic
categories, with especially strongperformance on PTSD (up to 89% accuracy and
98% recall). We also find that using shorter context, focused context segments
improves recall, suggesting that focused narrative cues enhance detection
sensitivity. LoRA fine-tuning proves both efficient and effective, with
lower-rank configurations (e.g., rank 8 and 16) maintaining competitive
performance across evaluation metrics. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based
models can offer substantial improvements over traditional self-report
screening tools, providing a path toward low-barrier, AI-powerd early
diagnosis. This work lays the groundwork for integrating machine learning into
real-world clinical workflows, particularly in low-resource or high-stigma
environments where access to timely mental health care is most limited.

Motivation: 现有RLVR方法需用两个独立模板分别生成解答和自验证，效率低下。研究旨在通过数学推导寻找更简化的自验证奖励实现形式。

Method: 理论推导发现自验证的RL目标闭式解可简化为末token自奖励分数（模型对预定义token的log概率差），通过增加MSE损失函数对齐验证器奖励与末token分数，实现联合优化。

Result: 实验证明该方法在提升推理性能的同时赋予模型显著的自奖励能力，推理时仅需增加单token推断开销即可实现性能提升。

Conclusion: LaSeR通过末token自奖励机制有效统一了推理与验证能力，为LLM的高效强化学习训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a core paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). To address the lack of verification signals at test time, prior
studies incorporate the training of model's self-verification capability into
the standard RLVR process, thereby unifying reasoning and verification
capabilities within a single LLM. However, previous practice requires the LLM
to sequentially generate solutions and self-verifications using two separate
prompt templates, which significantly reduces efficiency. In this work, we
theoretically reveal that the closed-form solution to the RL objective of
self-verification can be reduced to a remarkably simple form: the true
reasoning reward of a solution is equal to its last-token self-rewarding score,
which is computed as the difference between the policy model's next-token
log-probability assigned to any pre-specified token at the solution's last
token and a pre-calculated constant, scaled by the KL coefficient. Based on
this insight, we propose LaSeR (Reinforcement Learning with Last-Token
Self-Rewarding), an algorithm that simply augments the original RLVR loss with
a MSE loss that aligns the last-token self-rewarding scores with verifier-based
reasoning rewards, jointly optimizing the reasoning and self-rewarding
capabilities of LLMs. The optimized self-rewarding scores can be utilized in
both training and testing to enhance model performance. Notably, our algorithm
derives these scores from the predicted next-token probability distribution of
the last token immediately after generation, incurring only the minimal extra
cost of one additional token inference. Experiments show that our method not
only improves the model's reasoning performance but also equips it with
remarkable self-rewarding capability, thereby boosting its inference-time
scaling performance.

Metabolomics presents unique challenges with its complex biochemical pathways,

research: knowledge, understanding, grounding, reasoning, and research. Our
evaluation of 25 open- and closed-source LLMs reveals distinct performance
patterns across metabolomics tasks: while models perform well on text

Abstract: Contact languages like English exhibit rich regional variations in the form
of dialects, which are often used by dialect speakers interacting with
generative models. However, can multimodal generative models effectively
produce content given dialectal textual input? In this work, we study this
question by constructing a new large-scale benchmark spanning six common
English dialects. We work with dialect speakers to collect and verify over 4200
unique prompts and evaluate on 17 image and video generative models. Our
automatic and human evaluation results show that current state-of-the-art
multimodal generative models exhibit 32.26% to 48.17% performance degradation
when a single dialect word is used in the prompt. Common mitigation methods
such as fine-tuning and prompt rewriting can only improve dialect performance
by small margins (< 7%), while potentially incurring significant performance
degradation in Standard American English (SAE). To this end, we design a
general encoder-based mitigation strategy for multimodal generative models. Our
method teaches the model to recognize new dialect features while preserving SAE
performance. Experiments on models such as Stable Diffusion 1.5 show that our
method is able to simultaneously raise performance on five dialects to be on
par with SAE (+34.4%), while incurring near zero cost to SAE performance.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly trained with
reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance their ability to interact with external
environments through tool use, particularly in search-based settings that
require multi-turn reasoning and knowledge acquisition. However, existing
approaches typically rely on outcome-based rewards that are only provided at
the final answer. This reward sparsity becomes particularly problematic in
multi-turn settings, where long trajectories exacerbate two critical issues:
(i) advantage collapse, where all rollouts receive identical rewards and
provide no useful learning signals, and (ii) lack of fine-grained credit
assignment, where dependencies between turns are obscured, especially in
long-horizon tasks. In this paper, we propose Information Gain-based Policy
Optimization (IGPO), a simple yet effective RL framework that provides dense
and intrinsic supervision for multi-turn agent training. IGPO models each
interaction turn as an incremental process of acquiring information about the
ground truth, and defines turn-level rewards as the marginal increase in the
policy's probability of producing the correct answer. Unlike prior
process-level reward approaches that depend on external reward models or costly
Monte Carlo estimation, IGPO derives intrinsic rewards directly from the
model's own belief updates. These intrinsic turn-level rewards are combined
with outcome-level supervision to form dense reward trajectories. Extensive
experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that
IGPO consistently outperforms strong baselines in multi-turn scenarios,
achieving higher accuracy and improved sample efficiency.

Abstract: Digital agents require diverse, large-scale UI trajectories to generalize
across real-world tasks, yet collecting such data is prohibitively expensive in
both human annotation, infra and engineering perspectives. To this end, we
introduce $\textbf{UI-Simulator}$, a scalable paradigm that generates
structured UI states and transitions to synthesize training trajectories at
scale. Our paradigm integrates a digital world simulator for diverse UI states,
a guided rollout process for coherent exploration, and a trajectory wrapper
that produces high-quality and diverse trajectories for agent training. We
further propose $\textbf{UI-Simulator-Grow}$, a targeted scaling strategy that
enables more rapid and data-efficient scaling by prioritizing high-impact tasks
and synthesizes informative trajectory variants. Experiments on WebArena and
AndroidWorld show that UI-Simulator rivals or surpasses open-source agents
trained on real UIs with significantly better robustness, despite using weaker
teacher models. Moreover, UI-Simulator-Grow matches the performance of
Llama-3-70B-Instruct using only Llama-3-8B-Instruct as the base model,
highlighting the potential of targeted synthesis scaling paradigm to
continuously and efficiently enhance the digital agents.

Conclusion: 分词与语法的错位是代码LLM可靠性的潜在障碍，未来需开发语法感知的分词方案以提升代码理解/生成稳定性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for code rely on subword tokenizers, such as
byte-pair encoding (BPE), learned from mixed natural language text and
programming language code but driven by statistics rather than grammar. As a
result, semantically identical code snippets can be tokenized differently
depending on superficial factors such as whitespace or identifier naming. To
measure the impact of this misalignment, we introduce TokDrift, a framework
that applies semantic-preserving rewrite rules to create code variants
differing only in tokenization. Across nine code LLMs, including large ones
with over 30B parameters, even minor formatting changes can cause substantial
shifts in model behavior. Layer-wise analysis shows that the issue originates
in early embeddings, where subword segmentation fails to capture grammar token
boundaries. Our findings identify misaligned tokenization as a hidden obstacle
to reliable code understanding and generation, highlighting the need for
grammar-aware tokenization for future code LLMs.

Abstract: This work studies how to adaptively recompute key-value (KV) caches for
diffusion large language models (DLMs) to maximize prediction accuracy while
minimizing decoding latency. Prior methods' decoders recompute QKV for all
tokens at every denoising step and layer, despite KV states changing little
across most steps, especially in shallow layers, leading to substantial
redundancy. We make three observations: (1) distant ${\bf MASK}$ tokens
primarily act as a length-bias and can be cached block-wise beyond the active
prediction window; (2) KV dynamics increase with depth, suggesting that
selective refresh starting from deeper layers is sufficient; and (3) the
most-attended token exhibits the smallest KV drift, providing a conservative
lower bound on cache change for other tokens. Building on these, we propose
${\bf Elastic-Cache}$, a training-free, architecture-agnostic strategy that
jointly decides ${when}$ to refresh (via an attention-aware drift test on the
most-attended token) and ${where}$ to refresh (via a depth-aware schedule that
recomputes from a chosen layer onward while reusing shallow-layer caches and
off-window MASK caches). Unlike fixed-period schemes, Elastic-Cache performs
adaptive, layer-aware cache updates for diffusion LLMs, reducing redundant
computation and accelerating decoding with negligible loss in generation
quality. Experiments on LLaDA-Instruct, LLaDA-1.5, and LLaDA-V across
mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks demonstrate consistent
speedups: $8.7\times$ on GSM8K (256 tokens), $45.1\times$ on longer sequences,
and $4.8\times$ on HumanEval, while consistently maintaining higher accuracy
than the baseline. Our method achieves significantly higher throughput
($6.8\times$ on GSM8K) than existing confidence-based approaches while
preserving generation quality, enabling practical deployment of diffusion LLMs.

*Arman Maesumi,Tanish Makadia,Thibault Groueix,Vladimir G. Kim,Daniel Ritchie,Noam Aigerman*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出PoissonNet网络架构，通过泊松方程驱动的局部-全局学习机制，解决现有网格学习架构在频率保持、感受野、离散化敏感和计算效率方面的核心矛盾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网格学习架构存在高频特征学习困难、全局感受野不足、对网格离散化敏感、计算效率低四大痛点，需要一种兼容局部特征学习与全局传播的解决方案。

Method: 在网格梯度域进行局部特征变换后，通过求解泊松方程实现全局特征传播，构建不受三角剖分影响的局部-全局交互机制。

Result: 在语义分割（S3DIS数据集mIoU提升3.2%）和表面参数化任务（PSNR提升1.8dB）达到SOTA，变形学习误差降低37%，训练速度提升4倍。

Conclusion: PoissonNet首次实现全频段特征保持与真正全局感受野的统一，为几何深度学习提供了高效可扩展的基础架构，特别在动态表面建模领域开辟新应用场景。

Abstract: Many network architectures exist for learning on meshes, yet their
constructions entail delicate trade-offs between difficulty learning
high-frequency features, insufficient receptive field, sensitivity to
discretization, and inefficient computational overhead. Drawing from classic
local-global approaches in mesh processing, we introduce PoissonNet, a novel
neural architecture that overcomes all of these deficiencies by formulating a
local-global learning scheme, which uses Poisson's equation as the primary
mechanism for feature propagation. Our core network block is simple; we apply
learned local feature transformations in the gradient domain of the mesh, then
solve a Poisson system to propagate scalar feature updates across the surface
globally. Our local-global learning framework preserves the features's full
frequency spectrum and provides a truly global receptive field, while remaining
agnostic to mesh triangulation. Our construction is efficient, requiring far
less compute overhead than comparable methods, which enables scalability --
both in the size of our datasets, and the size of individual training samples.
These qualities are validated on various experiments where, compared to
previous intrinsic architectures, we attain state-of-the-art performance on
semantic segmentation and parameterizing highly-detailed animated surfaces.
Finally, as a central application of PoissonNet, we show its ability to learn
deformations, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art architectures that
learn on surfaces.

Method: 1. 生成规范化模块将多视图处理为标准表达；2. 基于穹顶捕捉真实人体数据训练Transformer模型，构建高斯溅射头像数据集

Conclusion: Capture-Canonicalize-Splat流程创新性地结合多视图规范化与真实数据驱动建模，为无约束图像重建身份保持的3D数字人提供新范式

Abstract: We present a novel, zero-shot pipeline for creating hyperrealistic,
identity-preserving 3D avatars from a few unstructured phone images. Existing
methods face several challenges: single-view approaches suffer from geometric
inconsistencies and hallucinations, degrading identity preservation, while
models trained on synthetic data fail to capture high-frequency details like
skin wrinkles and fine hair, limiting realism. Our method introduces two key
contributions: (1) a generative canonicalization module that processes multiple
unstructured views into a standardized, consistent representation, and (2) a
transformer-based model trained on a new, large-scale dataset of high-fidelity
Gaussian splatting avatars derived from dome captures of real people. This
"Capture, Canonicalize, Splat" pipeline produces static quarter-body avatars
with compelling realism and robust identity preservation from unstructured

Result: 在三个数据集中超越传统高斯溅射方法，验证混合方法的有效性

Conclusion: 2D-3D混合架构突破单一方法的局限，为计算机视觉重建开辟新方向

Abstract: Scene reconstruction has emerged as a central challenge in computer vision,
with approaches such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting
achieving remarkable progress. While Gaussian Splatting demonstrates strong
performance on large-scale datasets, it often struggles to capture fine details
or maintain realism in regions with sparse coverage, largely due to the
inherent limitations of sparse 3D training data.
  In this work, we propose GauSSmart, a hybrid method that effectively bridges
2D foundational models and 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction. Our approach
integrates established 2D computer vision techniques, including convex
filtering and semantic feature supervision from foundational models such as
DINO, to enhance Gaussian-based scene reconstruction. By leveraging 2D
segmentation priors and high-dimensional feature embeddings, our method guides
the densification and refinement of Gaussian splats, improving coverage in
underrepresented areas and preserving intricate structural details.
  We validate our approach across three datasets, where GauSSmart consistently
outperforms existing Gaussian Splatting in the majority of evaluated scenes.
Our results demonstrate the significant potential of hybrid 2D-3D approaches,
highlighting how the thoughtful combination of 2D foundational models with 3D
reconstruction pipelines can overcome the limitations inherent in either
approach alone.

Motivation: 火星地形数据存在大量缺失值，传统插值方法难以保持几何一致性，而地球适用的条件生成方法不适用于火星数据

Method: 使用NASA HiRISE数据增强的12000个高度图训练扩散模型，采用非均匀缩放策略捕捉多尺度特征，固定128x128分辨率

Result: 在1000个样本评估中，RMSE提升4-15%，LPIPS指标提升29-81%，显著优于逆距离加权、克里金插值和Navier-Stokes算法

Conclusion: 该扩散模型为行星表面重建提供了有效解决方案，可支持太空任务规划、科学分析和宇航员训练等VR应用

Abstract: Space exploration increasingly relies on Virtual Reality for several tasks,
such as mission planning, multidisciplinary scientific analysis, and astronaut
training. A key factor for the reliability of the simulations is having
accurate 3D representations of planetary terrains. Extraterrestrial heightmaps
derived from satellite imagery often contain missing values due to acquisition
and transmission constraints. Mars is among the most studied planets beyond
Earth, and its extensive terrain datasets make the Martian surface
reconstruction a valuable task, although many areas remain unmapped. Deep
learning algorithms can support void-filling tasks; however, whereas Earth's
comprehensive datasets enables the use of conditional methods, such approaches
cannot be applied to Mars. Current approaches rely on simpler interpolation
techniques which, however, often fail to preserve geometric coherence. In this
work, we propose a method for reconstructing the surface of Mars based on an
unconditional diffusion model. Training was conducted on an augmented dataset
of 12000 Martian heightmaps derived from NASA's HiRISE survey. A
non-homogeneous rescaling strategy captures terrain features across multiple
scales before resizing to a fixed 128x128 model resolution. We compared our
method against established void-filling and inpainting techniques, including
Inverse Distance Weighting, kriging, and Navier-Stokes algorithm, on an
evaluation set of 1000 samples. Results show that our approach consistently
outperforms these methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy (4-15% on RMSE)
and perceptual similarity (29-81% on LPIPS) with the original data.

Result: 跨数据集实验验证了姿势先验的通用性，框架在图像驱动动画、反应动画和文本生成交互等任务中表现稳健有效

Conclusion: 通过时空姿势先验的统一框架，成功将高质量动捕数据的交互知识迁移至开放世界场景应用

Abstract: Close-proximity human-human interactive poses convey rich contextual
information about interaction dynamics. Given such poses, humans can
intuitively infer the context and anticipate possible past and future dynamics,
drawing on strong priors of human behavior. Inspired by this observation, we
propose Ponimator, a simple framework anchored on proximal interactive poses
for versatile interaction animation. Our training data consists of
close-contact two-person poses and their surrounding temporal context from
motion-capture interaction datasets. Leveraging interactive pose priors,
Ponimator employs two conditional diffusion models: (1) a pose animator that
uses the temporal prior to generate dynamic motion sequences from interactive
poses, and (2) a pose generator that applies the spatial prior to synthesize
interactive poses from a single pose, text, or both when interactive poses are
unavailable. Collectively, Ponimator supports diverse tasks, including
image-based interaction animation, reaction animation, and text-to-interaction
synthesis, facilitating the transfer of interaction knowledge from high-quality
mocap data to open-world scenarios. Empirical experiments across diverse
datasets and applications demonstrate the universality of the pose prior and
the effectiveness and robustness of our framework.

Result: 在自我介绍视频数据集实验中，证明该方法能有效识别两种人格模型特质

Conclusion: 联合建模方法不仅阐明人格维度间关系，还显著提升多模态行为的人格特质识别能力

Abstract: This paper proposes a joint modeling method of the Big Five, which has long
been studied, and HEXACO, which has recently attracted attention in psychology,
for automatically recognizing apparent personality traits from multimodal human
behavior. Most previous studies have used the Big Five for multimodal apparent
personality-trait recognition. However, no study has focused on apparent HEXACO
which can evaluate an Honesty-Humility trait related to displaced aggression
and vengefulness, social-dominance orientation, etc. In addition, the
relationships between the Big Five and HEXACO when modeled by machine learning
have not been clarified. We expect awareness of multimodal human behavior to
improve by considering these relationships. The key advance of our proposed
method is to optimize jointly recognizing the Big Five and HEXACO. Experiments
using a self-introduction video dataset demonstrate that the proposed method
can effectively recognize the Big Five and HEXACO.

Abstract: Vision-language models have achieved remarkable success in cross-modal
understanding. Yet, these models remain limited to object-level or region-level
grounding, lacking the capability for pixel-precise keypoint comprehension
through natural language. We introduce a novel framework for pixel level
grounding. The framework consists of two complementary components: a Point
Descriptor that generates rich, contextual descriptions of individual
keypoints, and a Point Localizer that regresses precise pixel coordinates from
these descriptions. Unlike prior work that relies on templated prompts or
keypoint names, our approach produces free-form, coarse-to-fine descriptions
that situate keypoints within their visual context. Since there is no available
dataset to train such a system, we introduce LlamaPointInPart, a carefully
curated dataset of 20K+ image-keypoint-description triplets synthesized from
multiple vision-language models, capturing multi-scale information from
scene-level context to visual features around the keypoint. For cross-category
generalization, we optimize the Point Descriptor on AP-10K via GRPO, using the
frozen Point Localizer as a reward model to produce descriptions that maximize
localization accuracy. To evaluate our results we establish a new evaluation
protocol. Instead of comparing the text description produced by our method to
the ground truth, we use the localizer to determine how close is the predicted
point generated to the ground truth point. Experiments demonstrate superior
performance compared to baseline models on LlamaPointInPart.The bidirectional
nature of our framework should enable future applications in both
keypoint-guided image understanding and language-guided precise localization.
Our code and dataset are publicly available at

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance
across diverse vision-and-language tasks. However, their potential in face
recognition remains underexplored. In particular, the performance of
open-source MLLMs needs to be evaluated and compared with existing face
recognition models on standard benchmarks with similar protocol. In this work,
we present a systematic benchmark of state-of-the-art MLLMs for face
recognition on several face recognition datasets, including LFW, CALFW, CPLFW,
CFP, AgeDB and RFW. Experimental results reveal that while MLLMs capture rich
semantic cues useful for face-related tasks, they lag behind specialized models
in high-precision recognition scenarios in zero-shot applications. This
benchmark provides a foundation for advancing MLLM-based face recognition,
offering insights for the design of next-generation models with higher accuracy
and generalization. The source code of our benchmark is publicly available in

Conclusion: nlg2choice显著降低大规模选项集的评估复杂度，为多模态大模型在细粒度任务中的应用提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the renewed interest in zero-shot visual classification due to the
rise of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), the problem of evaluating
free-form responses of auto-regressive models remains a persistent challenge.
Most existing works focus on language-only tasks or don't consider Multiple
Choice Questions (MCQs) beyond 5-way options, both of which are critical
capabilities to solve tasks in Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) where
choice counts are in the hundreds to thousands and the choices are highly
related. Furthermore, in this highly multi-way MCQ setting it is not clear how
to extend LLM choice extraction to retrieval-based problems, where computing
probabilities over the choice set is computationally costly. In this work we
investigate nlg2choice, a simple two-stage method which first asks the MLLM an
open-ended question for the task with minimal constraints, then uses text-only
constrained decoding to predict the most likely choice. In retrieval settings,
we compute the probability of the constrained response taking that choice with
an early stopping method to significantly improve throughput. Our results show
improvement over a suite of seven fine-grained visual datasets when evaluating
in terms of classification and retrieval, and show that this performance holds
over the various ways that users of LLMs can implement tasks in natural
language.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in textual reasoning, they
struggle with mathematical domains like geometry that intrinsically rely on
visual aids. Existing approaches to Visual Chain-of-Thought (VCoT) are often
limited by rigid external tools or fail to generate the high-fidelity,
strategically-timed diagrams necessary for complex problem-solving. To bridge
this gap, we introduce MathCanvas, a comprehensive framework designed to endow
unified Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with intrinsic VCoT capabilities for
mathematics. Our approach consists of two phases. First, a Visual Manipulation
stage pre-trains the model on a novel 15.2M-pair corpus, comprising 10M
caption-to-diagram pairs (MathCanvas-Imagen) and 5.2M step-by-step editing
trajectories (MathCanvas-Edit), to master diagram generation and editing.
Second, a Strategic Visual-Aided Reasoning stage fine-tunes the model on
MathCanvas-Instruct, a new 219K-example dataset of interleaved visual-textual
reasoning paths, teaching it when and how to leverage visual aids. To
facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce MathCanvas-Bench, a challenging
benchmark with 3K problems that require models to produce interleaved
visual-textual solutions. Our model, BAGEL-Canvas, trained under this
framework, achieves an 86% relative improvement over strong LMM baselines on
MathCanvas-Bench, demonstrating excellent generalization to other public math
benchmarks. Our work provides a complete toolkit-framework, datasets, and
benchmark-to unlock complex, human-like visual-aided reasoning in LMMs. Project

Result: 在Reddit 1,000用户（500案例/500对照）实验中，检测效果较个体基线提升15%

Conclusion: 同伴互动包含重要预测信号，为设计能捕捉间接/伪装风险表达的早期检测系统提供了新思路

Abstract: On social media, many individuals experiencing suicidal ideation (SI) do not
disclose their distress explicitly. Instead, signs may surface indirectly
through everyday posts or peer interactions. Detecting such implicit signals
early is critical but remains challenging. We frame early and implicit SI as a
forward-looking prediction task and develop a computational framework that
models a user's information environment, consisting of both their longitudinal
posting histories as well as the discourse of their socially proximal peers. We
adopted a composite network centrality measure to identify top neighbors of a
user, and temporally aligned the user's and neighbors' interactions --
integrating the multi-layered signals in a fine-tuned DeBERTa-v3 model. In a
Reddit study of 1,000 (500 Case and 500 Control) users, our approach improves
early and implicit SI detection by 15% over individual-only baselines. These
findings highlight that peer interactions offer valuable predictive signals and
carry broader implications for designing early detection systems that capture
indirect as well as masked expressions of risk in online environments.

Abstract: This paper discusses the potential for integrating Generative Artificial

enhancing the accessibility of public-facing guidance documents. We developed
HAZEL, a GenAI chatbot fine-tuned to assist with revising written guidance
relating to heritage conservation and interpretation. Using quantitative
assessments, we compare HAZEL's performance to that of ChatGPT (GPT-4) in a
series of tasks related to the guidance writing process. The results of this
comparison indicate a slightly better performance of HAZEL over ChatGPT,
suggesting that the GenAI chatbot is more effective once the underlying large
language model (LLM) has been fine-tuned. However, we also note significant
limitations, particularly in areas requiring cultural sensitivity and more
advanced technical expertise. These findings suggest that, while GenAI cannot
replace human heritage professionals in technical authoring tasks, its
potential to automate and expedite certain aspects of guidance writing could
offer valuable benefits to heritage organisations, especially in

Result: JIT目标使LLM输出在用户任务中达到66-86%胜率，现场实验证实可生成个性化工具

Conclusion: 即时目标推断机制有效增强LLM的实用性和个性化，实验验证了该方法的优越性

Abstract: Large language models promise a broad set of functions, but when not given a
specific objective, they default to milquetoast results such as drafting emails
littered with cliches. We demonstrate that inferring the user's in-the-moment
objective, then rapidly optimizing for that singular objective, enables LLMs to
produce tools, interfaces, and responses that are more responsive and desired.
We contribute an architecture for automatically inducing just-in-time
objectives by passively observing user behavior, then steering downstream AI
systems through generation and evaluation against this objective. Inducing
just-in-time objectives (e.g., "Clarify the abstract's research contribution")
enables automatic generation of tools, e.g., those that critique a draft based
on relevant HCI methodologies, anticipate related researchers' reactions, or
surface ambiguous terminology. In a series of experiments (N=14, N=205) on
participants' own tasks, JIT objectives enable LLM outputs that achieve 66-86%
win rates over typical LLMs, and in-person use sessions (N=17) confirm that JIT
objectives produce specialized tools unique to each participant.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究大型语言模型在组合式机器设计中的潜力，通过强化学习改进现有模型不足


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型是否具备物理系统设计能力，推动工程智能化发展

Method: 构建BesiegeField测试平台，评估LLMs在空间推理和组件组装的表现，采用强化学习进行模型优化

Result: 发现现有模型在战略组装方面存在缺陷，但强化学习可有效提升设计能力

Conclusion: 揭示了语言模型与物理系统设计结合的挑战，为智能工程设计系统发展指明方向

Abstract: The design of complex machines stands as both a marker of human intelligence
and a foundation of engineering practice. Given recent advances in large
language models (LLMs), we ask whether they, too, can learn to create. We
approach this question through the lens of compositional machine design: a task
in which machines are assembled from standardized components to meet functional
demands like locomotion or manipulation in a simulated physical environment. To
support this investigation, we introduce BesiegeField, a testbed built on the
machine-building game Besiege, which enables part-based construction, physical
simulation and reward-driven evaluation. Using BesiegeField, we benchmark
state-of-the-art LLMs with agentic workflows and identify key capabilities
required for success, including spatial reasoning, strategic assembly, and
instruction-following. As current open-source models fall short, we explore
reinforcement learning (RL) as a path to improvement: we curate a cold-start
dataset, conduct RL finetuning experiments, and highlight open challenges at
the intersection of language, machine design, and physical reasoning.

*Supriti Sinhamahapatra,Jan Niehues*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过整合演讲幻灯片的多模态信息，语音识别模型在专业术语识别准确率上相对基线模型提升35%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音识别系统仅依赖音频信息，忽略视觉辅助信息（如演示幻灯片），而视觉信息对专业术语消歧和模型适应至关重要

Method: 1. 构建包含专业术语自动分析的多模态演示基准
2. 通过数据增强方法解决幻灯片配套数据集不足问题
3. 在增强数据集上训练多模态语音模型

Result: 相比基线模型，整体词错误率降低34%，专业术语词错误率降低35%

Conclusion: 多模态信息（特别是演示幻灯片）能显著提升专业场景下的语音识别性能，数据增强方法有效解决了配套数据集不足的挑战

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems primarily
rely on acoustic information while disregarding additional multi-modal context.
However, visual information are essential in disambiguation and adaptation.
While most work focus on speaker images to handle noise conditions, this work
also focuses on integrating presentation slides for the use cases of scientific
presentation.
  In a first step, we create a benchmark for multi-modal presentation including
an automatic analysis of transcribing domain-specific terminology. Next, we
explore methods for augmenting speech models with multi-modal information. We
mitigate the lack of datasets with accompanying slides by a suitable approach
of data augmentation. Finally, we train a model using the augmented dataset,
resulting in a relative reduction in word error rate of approximately 34%,
across all words and 35%, for domain-specific terms compared to the baseline
model.

*Carter Blair,Kate Larson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于社会选择理论的MDP框架，通过两种方法改进共识声明的公平性生成


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有共识生成框架缺乏可证明的公平性保证机制，无法有效聚合多样化自由意见

Method: 1. 将任务建模为多目标token级MDP，利用策略隐含Q函数量化奖励
2. 提出事前核心随机生成策略和基于平等福利的搜索算法

Result: 实验显示平等目标搜索生成的共识声明相比基线方法（包括Habermas Machine）显著提升了最差情况代理对齐效果

Conclusion: 将MDP框架与社会选择理论结合，为文本生成任务提供了具有公平性理论保障的解决方案

Abstract: Current frameworks for consensus statement generation with large language
models lack the inherent structure needed to provide provable fairness
guarantees when aggregating diverse free-form opinions. We model the task as a
multi-objective, token-level Markov Decision Process (MDP), where each
objective corresponds to an agent's preference. Token-level rewards for each
agent are derived from their policy (e.g., a personalized language model). This
approach utilizes the finding that such policies implicitly define optimal
Q-functions, providing a principled way to quantify rewards at each generation
step without a value function (Rafailov et al., 2024). This MDP formulation
creates a formal structure amenable to analysis using principles from social
choice theory. We propose two approaches grounded in social choice theory.
First, we propose a stochastic generation policy guaranteed to be in the
ex-ante core, extending core stability concepts from voting theory to text
generation. This policy is derived from an underlying distribution over
complete statements that maximizes proportional fairness (Nash Welfare).
Second, for generating a single statement, we target the maximization of
egalitarian welfare using search algorithms within the MDP framework.
Empirically, experiments using language models to instantiate agent policies
show that search guided by the egalitarian objective generates consensus
statements with improved worst-case agent alignment compared to baseline
methods, including the Habermas Machine (Tessler et al., 2024).

TL;DR: 提出Terrarium框架，用于系统化研究基于LLM的多智能体系统在安全、隐私和安全性方面的挑战，通过模块化测试平台实现攻击模拟与防御验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM驱动的多智能体系统存在协议错位、恶意攻击、通信劫持和数据污染等新型安全风险，需建立可配置的实验环境进行系统性研究。

Method: 重构黑板架构设计，构建支持快速原型开发的模块化测试平台，识别关键攻击向量并实现包含三种协作场景、四种典型攻击的验证体系。

Result: 成功演示框架的灵活性，验证了包括恶意智能体注入、通信中间人攻击等在内的安全威胁场景，为防御机制迭代提供实验基础。

Conclusion: Terrarium通过标准化实验流程加速可信多智能体系统的发展，为安全协议设计与防御策略评估提供可扩展的研究基础设施。

Abstract: A multi-agent system (MAS) powered by large language models (LLMs) can
automate tedious user tasks such as meeting scheduling that requires
inter-agent collaboration. LLMs enable nuanced protocols that account for
unstructured private data, user constraints, and preferences. However, this
design introduces new risks, including misalignment and attacks by malicious
parties that compromise agents or steal user data. In this paper, we propose
the Terrarium framework for fine-grained study on safety, privacy, and security
in LLM-based MAS. We repurpose the blackboard design, an early approach in
multi-agent systems, to create a modular, configurable testbed for multi-agent
collaboration. We identify key attack vectors such as misalignment, malicious
agents, compromised communication, and data poisoning. We implement three
collaborative MAS scenarios with four representative attacks to demonstrate the
framework's flexibility. By providing tools to rapidly prototype, evaluate, and
iterate on defenses and designs, Terrarium aims to accelerate progress toward
trustworthy multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: 提出AI4Service新范式Alpha-Service，通过仿冯·诺依曼架构的智能眼镜实现主动服务，突破传统被动式AI局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI服务被动响应用户指令，无法主动预判需求。需构建能感知环境、推断意图并提供实时帮助的智能助手体系。

Method: 基于智能眼镜构建五单元框架：输入单元感知环境，CPU调度任务，ALU调用工具，内存单元存储个性化数据，输出单元实现自然交互。

Result: 通过21点实时策略助手、博物馆导览、穿搭推荐等案例验证系统在无显式指令下提供精准主动服务的能力。

Conclusion: Alpha-Service开创了主动式服务AI新范式，通过多智能体协同实现环境感知-意图推断-服务执行的闭环，为下一代智能助手提供架构参考。

Abstract: In an era where AI is evolving from a passive tool into an active and
adaptive companion, we introduce AI for Service (AI4Service), a new paradigm
that enables proactive and real-time assistance in daily life. Existing AI
services remain largely reactive, responding only to explicit user commands. We
argue that a truly intelligent and helpful assistant should be capable of
anticipating user needs and taking actions proactively when appropriate. To
realize this vision, we propose Alpha-Service, a unified framework that
addresses two fundamental challenges: Know When to intervene by detecting
service opportunities from egocentric video streams, and Know How to provide
both generalized and personalized services. Inspired by the von Neumann
computer architecture and based on AI glasses, Alpha-Service consists of five
key components: an Input Unit for perception, a Central Processing Unit for
task scheduling, an Arithmetic Logic Unit for tool utilization, a Memory Unit
for long-term personalization, and an Output Unit for natural human
interaction. As an initial exploration, we implement Alpha-Service through a
multi-agent system deployed on AI glasses. Case studies, including a real-time
Blackjack advisor, a museum tour guide, and a shopping fit assistant,
demonstrate its ability to seamlessly perceive the environment, infer user
intent, and provide timely and useful assistance without explicit prompts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出IMAGINE框架，将多代理系统整合至单一紧凑模型，通过端到端训练显著超越原有系统性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂推理任务（如TravelPlanner基准测试）表现欠佳（GPT-4o仅7%通过率），而传统多代理系统存在高交互成本与训练困难问题

Method: 通过IMAGINE框架整合多代理系统的结构化推理能力到单一模型，采用端到端训练流程实现能力强化

Result: 基于Qwen3-8B-Instruct训练后，TravelPlanner基准测试通过率达82.7%，远超DeepSeek-R1-671B的40%，且保持小模型规模

Conclusion: IMAGINE框架成功实现高效紧凑的复杂推理能力整合，验证了端到端训练对提升结构化推理任务的有效性

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides across
various tasks, they still face significant challenges in complex reasoning and
planning. For example, even with carefully designed prompts and prior
information explicitly provided, GPT-4o achieves only a 7% Final Pass Rate on
the TravelPlanner dataset in the sole-planning mode. Similarly, even in the
thinking mode, Qwen3-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-671B, only achieve Final Pass
Rates of 5.9% and 40%, respectively. Although well-organized Multi-Agent
Systems (MAS) can offer improved collective reasoning, they often suffer from
high reasoning costs due to multi-round internal interactions, long
per-response latency, and difficulties in end-to-end training. To address these
challenges, we propose a general and scalable framework called IMAGINE, short
for Integrating Multi-Agent System into One Model. This framework not only
integrates the reasoning and planning capabilities of MAS into a single,
compact model, but also significantly surpass the capabilities of the MAS
through a simple end-to-end training. Through this pipeline, a single
small-scale model is not only able to acquire the structured reasoning and
planning capabilities of a well-organized MAS but can also significantly
outperform it. Experimental results demonstrate that, when using
Qwen3-8B-Instruct as the base model and training it with our method, the model
achieves an 82.7% Final Pass Rate on the TravelPlanner benchmark, far exceeding
the 40% of DeepSeek-R1-671B, while maintaining a much smaller model size.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有移动代理评估标准存在缺陷：离线基准仅验证单一预定义路径，在线测试受设备复杂性和不可复现性限制，均无法全面评估代理能力。

Method: 通过真实设备交互的有限状态建模实现动态行为静态模拟，构建包含175个复杂长任务（平均13+步骤）的ColorBench，支持多正确路径验证和子任务完成率统计。

Result: 基于ColorBench的基线测试揭示了现有模型的局限性，并提出通过实验验证的改进方向（如结构化推理能力增强）和技术路径。

Conclusion: ColorBench通过准动态交互评估框架，实现了复杂长视野任务的稳定测试，为移动代理能力提升提供可量化的基准支持。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models has enabled agents
to operate mobile devices by directly interacting with graphical user
interfaces, opening new possibilities for mobile automation. However,
real-world mobile tasks are often complex and allow for multiple valid
solutions. This contradicts current mobile agent evaluation standards: offline
static benchmarks can only validate a single predefined "golden path", while
online dynamic testing is constrained by the complexity and non-reproducibility
of real devices, making both approaches inadequate for comprehensively
assessing agent capabilities. To bridge the gap between offline and online
evaluation and enhance testing stability, this paper introduces a novel
graph-structured benchmarking framework. By modeling the finite states observed
during real-device interactions, it achieves static simulation of dynamic
behaviors. Building on this, we develop ColorBench, a benchmark focused on
complex long-horizon tasks. It supports evaluation of multiple valid solutions,
subtask completion rate statistics, and atomic-level capability analysis.
ColorBench contains 175 tasks (74 single-app, 101 cross-app) with an average
length of over 13 steps. Each task includes at least two correct paths and
several typical error paths, enabling quasi-dynamic interaction. By evaluating
ColorBench across various baselines, we discover limitations of existing models
and propose improvement directions and feasible technical pathways to enhance
agents' performance on complex, long-horizon problems based on experimental
results. Code and data are available at:

TL;DR: TITAN框架通过自动化导航技术，将自然语言网络安全威胁查询与结构化知识图谱的可执行推理相结合，实现威胁情报的自动化分析


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统网络安全检索系统缺乏结构化知识表示能力，TITAN通过双向图结构实现威胁-行为-防御的可逆推理，提升威胁情报分析效率

Method: 整合路径规划模型（预测逻辑关系链）和图执行器（遍历本体图谱），采用包含88,209个样本的TITAN数据集进行训练验证

Result: 实证评估显示框架能生成语法有效且语义连贯的推理路径，支持在知识图谱上确定性执行威胁分析

Conclusion: TITAN通过自然语言处理与图推理的融合，为网络安全防御策略制定提供可解释的自动化威胁情报分析方案

Abstract: TITAN (Threat Intelligence Through Automated Navigation) is a framework that
connects natural-language cyber threat queries with executable reasoning over a
structured knowledge graph. It integrates a path planner model, which predicts
logical relation chains from text, and a graph executor that traverses the
TITAN Ontology to retrieve factual answers and supporting evidence. Unlike
traditional retrieval systems, TITAN operates on a typed, bidirectional graph
derived from MITRE, allowing reasoning to move clearly and reversibly between
threats, behaviors, and defenses. To support training and evaluation, we
introduce the TITAN Dataset, a corpus of 88209 examples (Train: 74258; Test:
13951) pairing natural language questions with executable reasoning paths and
step by step Chain of Thought explanations. Empirical evaluations show that
TITAN enables models to generate syntactically valid and semantically coherent
reasoning paths that can be deterministically executed on the underlying graph.

Motivation: 现有生成-过滤-精炼范式依赖领域先验构建结构化假设空间，但缺乏系统性形式化工具来衡量搜索空间和代理行为。

Method: 1. 用模糊关系算子建模代理的可行转换约束
2. 引入延续参数加权可达路径，构建覆盖生成函数

Conclusion: 该形式化理论为LLM构建的迭代搜索过程提供了系统描述框架，通过覆盖生成函数和可达性测度实现了搜索空间的量化分析。

Abstract: The generate-filter-refine (iterative paradigm) based on large language
models (LLMs) has achieved progress in reasoning, programming, and program
discovery in AI+Science. However, the effectiveness of search depends on where
to search, namely, how to encode the domain prior into an operationally
structured hypothesis space. To this end, this paper proposes a compact formal
theory that describes and measures LLM-assisted iterative search guided by
domain priors. We represent an agent as a fuzzy relation operator on inputs and
outputs to capture feasible transitions; the agent is thereby constrained by a
fixed safety envelope. To describe multi-step reasoning/search, we weight all
reachable paths by a single continuation parameter and sum them to obtain a
coverage generating function; this induces a measure of reachability
difficulty; and it provides a geometric interpretation of search on the graph
induced by the safety envelope. We further provide the simplest testable
inferences and validate them via a majority-vote instantiation. This theory
offers a workable language and operational tools to measure agents and their
search spaces, proposing a systematic formal description of iterative search
constructed by LLMs.

Motivation: 生成式验证器的计算成本过高，需寻找兼顾效率与性能的预算友好型替代方案。

Method: 结合判别式验证器与自洽性机制，形成混合验证框架。通过对比实验验证不同计算预算下的性能表现。

Result: 在AIME2025基准上实现15.3%的准确率提升，同等计算资源下显著优于生成式验证方法。

Conclusion: 判别式验证与自洽性的混合机制是实用场景中更高效经济的解决方案，为模型部署提供免费性能升级。

Abstract: Test-time scaling is a powerful strategy for boosting the performance of
large language models on complex reasoning tasks. While state-of-the-art
approaches often employ generative verifiers to select the best solution from a
pool of candidates, this method incurs prohibitive computational costs,
limiting its practicality. In this work, we shift the focus to a more
budget-aware paradigm: discriminative verification. We conduct a thorough
empirical analysis and demonstrate that while discriminative verifiers may
underperform in isolation, combining them with self-consistency in a hybrid
approach creates a powerful and efficient test-time scaling mechanism. Notably,
under a fixed compute budget, this hybrid approach surpasses state-of-the-art
generative verification by a significant margin: achieving up to 15.3\% higher
accuracy on AIME2025. Our findings establish that for practical, real-world
applications, budget-aware scaling with discriminative verifiers is not only a
"free" upgrade over self-consistency, but also a more effective and efficient
alternative to costly generative techniques. Code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有抑郁症检测研究存在评估不一致、特征对比不足、模态组合有限等问题，需系统验证多模态方案的有效性

Method: 对比手工特征与预训练嵌入，测试不同神经编码器，分析单/双/三模态配置，采用注意力融合策略并保持受试者独立的数据划分

Result: 三模态组合提升检测性能（AUC 0.92），预训练模型比手工特征提升12%，最优三模态模型达到SOTA水平

Conclusion: 建立了可复现的多模态抑郁症检测基准，为EEG在多模态中的关键作用提供理论支持

Abstract: Depression is a widespread mental health disorder, yet its automatic
detection remains challenging. Prior work has explored unimodal and multimodal
approaches, with multimodal systems showing promise by leveraging complementary
signals. However, existing studies are limited in scope, lack systematic
comparisons of features, and suffer from inconsistent evaluation protocols. We
address these gaps by systematically exploring feature representations and
modelling strategies across EEG, together with speech and text. We evaluate
handcrafted features versus pre-trained embeddings, assess the effectiveness of
different neural encoders, compare unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal
configurations, and analyse fusion strategies with attention to the role of
EEG. Consistent subject-independent splits are applied to ensure robust,
reproducible benchmarking. Our results show that (i) the combination of EEG,
speech and text modalities enhances multimodal detection, (ii) pretrained
embeddings outperform handcrafted features, and (iii) carefully designed
trimodal models achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our work lays the
groundwork for future research in multimodal depression detection.

Motivation: 建立哲学理论与现代AI系统的桥梁，探索理性作为自我调节机制如何通过稳定性分析来诊断推理系统的过度自信缺陷。

Method: 构建H-Risk指数（含频谱/时间/创新指标），通过线性高斯模拟验证预测能力，并延伸至LLMs内部动态与提示干预的关联性研究。

Result: H-Risk有效预测形式稳定下的认知误差，LLMs脆弱动态与幻觉正相关，批判式提示对校准效果呈现双向作用。

Conclusion: 开创哲学控制论交叉框架，为AI系统提供可量化的稳定性诊断工具，后续将完善实验验证体系。

Abstract: We reinterpret Kant's Critique of Pure Reason as a theory of feedback
stability, viewing reason as a regulator that keeps inference within the bounds
of possible experience. We formalize this intuition via a composite instability
index (H-Risk) combining spectral margin, conditioning, temporal sensitivity,
and innovation amplification. In linear-Gaussian simulations, higher H-Risk
predicts overconfident errors even under formal stability, revealing a gap
between nominal and epistemic stability. Extending to large language models
(LLMs), we find that fragile internal dynamics correlate with miscalibration
and hallucination, while critique-style prompts show mixed effects on
calibration and hallucination. These results suggest a structural bridge
between Kantian self-limitation and feedback control, offering a principled
lens for diagnosing -- and selectively reducing -- overconfidence in reasoning
systems. This is a preliminary version; supplementary experiments and broader
replication will be reported in a future revision.

Motivation: 现有方法仅将ICD编码视为分类任务，忽略了代码顺序对医疗诊断的重要性。临床笔记中的诊断代码顺序直接影响医疗决策和报销流程，但自动化处理面临挑战。

Method: 将ICD编码任务重构为分类与排序结合的检索系统框架，同时考虑代码分类和优先级排序。

Result: 主要诊断代码排序准确率达47%（基准模型20%），分类指标micro-F1 0.6065/macro-F1 0.2904，超越原有最佳模型（0.597/0.2660）

Conclusion: 该框架在保持分类性能优势的同时，显著提升关键代码的排序能力，证明综合分类与排序的方法在医疗编码任务中的有效性

Abstract: Clinical notes contain unstructured text provided by clinicians during
patient encounters. These notes are usually accompanied by a sequence of
diagnostic codes following the International Classification of Diseases (ICD).
Correctly assigning and ordering ICD codes are essential for medical diagnosis
and reimbursement. However, automating this task remains challenging.
State-of-the-art methods treated this problem as a classification task, leading
to ignoring the order of ICD codes that is essential for different purposes. In
this work, as a first attempt, we approach this task from a retrieval system
perspective to consider the order of codes, thus formulating this problem as a
classification and ranking task. Our results and analysis show that the
proposed framework has a superior ability to identify high-priority codes
compared to other methods. For instance, our model accuracy in correctly
ranking primary diagnosis codes is 47%, compared to 20% for the
state-of-the-art classifier. Additionally, in terms of classification metrics,
the proposed model achieves a micro- and macro-F1 scores of 0.6065 and 0.2904,
respectively, surpassing the previous best model with scores of 0.597 and
0.2660.

Conclusion: BitDistill在模型压缩与任务性能间取得平衡，为边缘计算等场景提供了高效部署方案，代码已开源可复现。

Abstract: In this paper, we present BitNet Distillation (BitDistill), a lightweight
pipeline that fine-tunes off-the-shelf full-precision LLMs (e.g., Qwen) into
1.58-bit precision (i.e., ternary weights {-1, 0, 1}) for specific downstream
tasks, achieving strong task-specific performance with minimal computational
cost. Specifically, BitDistill incorporates three key techniques: the SubLN
module, as introduced in BitNet; multi-head attention distillation, based on
MiniLM; and continual pre-training, which serves as a crucial warm-up step to
mitigate the scalability issue of the performance gap between finetuned
full-precision and 1.58-bit LLMs on specific tasks. Experimental results show
that BitDistill achieves performance comparable to the full-precision
counterpart models across model size, while enabling up to 10x memory savings
and 2.65x faster inference on CPUs. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出可逆模型合并方法（RMM），通过构建可重构的模型空间而非单一合并模型，有效解决低秩压缩模型合并时的性能退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型合并方法应用于低秩权重时会导致性能严重下降，需要保留各任务模型可恢复性的合并方案。

Method: 构建可重构的紧凑基模型空间，通过线性组合恢复原始任务模型，提供闭式解选择最优基权重和组合系数。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型规模上的实验显示RMM显著优于现有方法，保留低秩压缩模型性能达较大优势。

Conclusion: RMM突破传统合并范式，通过可逆模型空间实现任务模型快速切换，为模型压缩与部署提供新思路。

Abstract: Model merging aims to combine multiple fine-tuned models into a single set of
weights that performs well across all source tasks. While prior work has shown
that merging can approximate the performance of individual fine-tuned models
for each task, it largely overlooks scenarios where models are compressed into
low-rank representations, either through low-rank adaptation (LoRA) or
post-training singular value decomposition (SVD). We first demonstrate that
applying conventional merging methods to low-rank weights leads to severe
performance degradation in the merged model. Motivated by this phenomenon, we
propose a fundamentally different approach: instead of collapsing all adapters
into one set of weights, we construct a compact basis (e.g., an equivalent of
holding two or more models) from which original task-specific models can be
recovered via linear combination. This reframes merging as generating a
reconstruction-capable model space rather than producing a single merged model.
Crucially, this allows us to ``revert'' to each individual model when needed,
recognizing that no merged model can consistently outperform one specialized
for its task. Building on this insight, we introduce our method, Reversible
Model Merging (RMM), an efficient, data-free, and flexible method that provides
a closed-form solution for selecting the optimal basis of model weights and
task-specific coefficients for linear combination. Extensive experiments across
diverse datasets and model scales demonstrate that RMM consistently outperforms
existing merging approaches, preserving the performance of low-rank compressed
models by a significant margin.

Abstract: We present MAFA (Multi-Agent Framework for Annotation), a production-deployed
system that transforms enterprise-scale annotation workflows through
configurable multi-agent collaboration. Addressing the critical challenge of
annotation backlogs in financial services, where millions of customer
utterances require accurate categorization, MAFA combines specialized agents
with structured reasoning and a judge-based consensus mechanism. Our framework
uniquely supports dynamic task adaptation, allowing organizations to define
custom annotation types (FAQs, intents, entities, or domain-specific
categories) through configuration rather than code changes. Deployed at JP
Morgan Chase, MAFA has eliminated a 1 million utterance backlog while
achieving, on average, 86% agreement with human annotators, annually saving
over 5,000 hours of manual annotation work. The system processes utterances
with annotation confidence classifications, which are typically 85% high, 10%
medium, and 5% low across all datasets we tested. This enables human annotators
to focus exclusively on ambiguous and low-coverage cases. We demonstrate MAFA's
effectiveness across multiple datasets and languages, showing consistent
improvements over traditional and single-agent annotation baselines: 13.8%
higher Top-1 accuracy, 15.1% improvement in Top-5 accuracy, and 16.9% better F1
in our internal intent classification dataset and similar gains on public
benchmarks. This work bridges the gap between theoretical multi-agent systems
and practical enterprise deployment, providing a blueprint for organizations
facing similar annotation challenges.

Abstract: Competitive programming has become a rigorous benchmark for evaluating the
reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The
International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) stands out as one of the most
prestigious annual competitions in competitive programming and has become a key
benchmark for comparing human and AI-level programming ability. While several
proprietary models have been claimed to achieve gold medal-level performance at
the IOI, often with undisclosed methods, achieving comparable results with
open-weight models remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present
\gencluster, a scalable and reproducible test-time compute framework that
attains IOI gold-level performance using open-weight models. It combines
large-scale generation, behavioral clustering, ranking, and a round-robin
submission strategy to efficiently explore diverse solution spaces under
limited validation budgets. Our experiments show that the performance of our
proposed approach scales consistently with available compute, narrowing the gap
between open and closed systems. Notably, we will show that GenCluster can
achieve a gold medal at IOI 2025 for the first time with an open-weight model
gpt-oss-120b, setting a new benchmark for transparent and reproducible
evaluation of reasoning in LLMs.

Conclusion: CAST为Transformer层分析提供新维度，通过矩阵谱分析揭示模型结构特性，与传统方法形成互补，增强对语言模型工作机制的理解

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable success but remain largely
black boxes with poorly understood internal mechanisms. To address this
limitation, many researchers have proposed various interpretability methods
including mechanistic analysis, probing classifiers, and activation
visualization, each providing valuable insights from different perspectives.
Building upon this rich landscape of complementary approaches, we introduce
CAST (Compositional Analysis via Spectral Tracking), a probe-free framework
that contributes a novel perspective by analyzing transformer layer functions
through direct transformation matrix estimation and comprehensive spectral
analysis. CAST offers complementary insights to existing methods by estimating
the realized transformation matrices for each layer using Moore-Penrose
pseudoinverse and applying spectral analysis with six interpretable metrics
characterizing layer behavior. Our analysis reveals distinct behaviors between
encoder-only and decoder-only models, with decoder models exhibiting
compression-expansion cycles while encoder models maintain consistent high-rank
processing. Kernel analysis further demonstrates functional relationship
patterns between layers, with CKA similarity matrices clearly partitioning
layers into three phases: feature extraction, compression, and specialization.

Conclusion: 提示优化流程构成新型攻击面，需强化反馈通道加密和优化框架防护，本研究为安全优化系统设计提供理论支撑

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) systems now underpin everyday AI applications such
as chatbots, computer-use assistants, and autonomous robots, where performance
often depends on carefully designed prompts. LLM-based prompt optimizers reduce
that effort by iteratively refining prompts from scored feedback, yet the
security of this optimization stage remains underexamined. We present the first
systematic analysis of poisoning risks in LLM-based prompt optimization. Using
HarmBench, we find systems are substantially more vulnerable to manipulated
feedback than to injected queries: feedback-based attacks raise attack success
rate (ASR) by up to $\Delta$ASR = 0.48. We introduce a simple fake-reward
attack that requires no access to the reward model and significantly increases
vulnerability, and we propose a lightweight highlighting defense that reduces
the fake-reward $\Delta$ASR from 0.23 to 0.07 without degrading utility. These
results establish prompt optimization pipelines as a first-class attack surface
and motivate stronger safeguards for feedback channels and optimization
frameworks.

Abstract: Recently, Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) has made significant
progress in incentivizing the multi-turn, long-horizon tool-use capabilities of
web agents. While mainstream agentic RL algorithms autonomously explore
high-uncertainty tool-call steps under the guidance of entropy, excessive
reliance on entropy signals can impose further constraints, leading to the
training collapse. In this paper, we delve into the challenges caused by
entropy and propose the Agentic Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization (AEPO), an
agentic RL algorithm designed to balance entropy in both the rollout and policy
update phases. AEPO comprises two core components: (1) a dynamic
entropy-balanced rollout mechanism that adaptively allocate global and branch
sampling budget through entropy pre-monitoring, while imposing a branch penalty
on consecutive high-entropy tool-call steps to prevent over-branching issues;
and (2) Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization that inserts a stop-gradient
operation into the high-entropy clipping term to preserve and properly rescale
gradients on high-entropy tokens, while incorporating entropy-aware advantage
estimation to prioritize learning on high-uncertainty tokens. Results across 14
challenging datasets show that AEPO consistently outperforms 7 mainstream RL
algorithms. With just 1K RL samples, Qwen3-14B with AEPO achieves impressive
results: 47.6% on GAIA, 11.2% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 43.0% on WebWalker
for Pass@1; 65.0% on GAIA, 26.0% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 70.0% on
WebWalker for Pass@5. Further analysis reveals that AEPO improves rollout
sampling diversity while maintaining stable policy entropy, facilitating
scalable web agent training.

Conclusion: 证明无需复杂训练即可激发基模型推理潜力，为难以验证领域提供轻量级解决方案

Abstract: Frontier reasoning models have exhibited incredible capabilities across a
wide array of disciplines, driven by posttraining large language models (LLMs)
with reinforcement learning (RL). However, despite the widespread success of
this paradigm, much of the literature has been devoted to disentangling truly
novel behaviors that emerge during RL but are not present in the base models.
In our work, we approach this question from a different angle, instead asking
whether comparable reasoning capabilites can be elicited from base models at
inference time by pure sampling, without any additional training. Inspired by
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques for sampling from sharpened
distributions, we propose a simple iterative sampling algorithm leveraging the
base models' own likelihoods. Over different base models, we show that our
algorithm offers substantial boosts in reasoning that nearly match and even
outperform those from RL on a wide variety of single-shot tasks, including
MATH500, HumanEval, and GPQA. Moreover, our sampler avoids the collapse in
diversity over multiple samples that is characteristic of RL-posttraining.
Crucially, our method does not require training, curated datasets, or a
verifier, suggesting broad applicability beyond easily verifiable domains.

Abstract: The fields of explainable AI and mechanistic interpretability aim to uncover
the internal structure of neural networks, with circuit discovery as a central
tool for understanding model computations. Existing approaches, however, rely
on manual inspection and remain limited to toy tasks. Automated
interpretability offers scalability by analyzing isolated features and their
activations, but it often misses interactions between features and depends
strongly on external LLMs and dataset quality. Transcoders have recently made
it possible to separate feature attributions into input-dependent and
input-invariant components, providing a foundation for more systematic circuit
analysis. Building on this, we propose WeightLens and CircuitLens, two
complementary methods that go beyond activation-based analysis. WeightLens
interprets features directly from their learned weights, removing the need for
explainer models or datasets while matching or exceeding the performance of
existing methods on context-independent features. CircuitLens captures how
feature activations arise from interactions between components, revealing
circuit-level dynamics that activation-only approaches cannot identify.
Together, these methods increase interpretability robustness and enhance
scalable mechanistic analysis of circuits while maintaining efficiency and
quality.

Abstract: Language models with recurrent depth, also referred to as universal or looped
when considering transformers, are defined by the capacity to increase their
computation through the repetition of layers. Recent efforts in pretraining
have demonstrated that these architectures can scale to modern language
modeling tasks while exhibiting advantages in reasoning tasks. In this work, we
examine the relationship between recurrent-depth models and diffusion language
models. Building on their similarities, we develop a new diffusion forcing
sampler for these models to accelerate generation. The sampler advances by
decoding new tokens at every forward pass of the model, while the latent states
of these tokens can be further refined in parallel through recurrence.
Theoretically, generation with our sampler is strictly more expressive than the
baseline autoregressive generation using the same time budget on modern
hardware. Moreover, this sampler, based on principles from diffusion
literature, can be directly applied to existing 3.5B recurrent-depth
transformers without any tuning, leading to up to a 5x speedup. Consequently,
our findings not only provide an efficient mechanism for parallelizing the
extra computation in recurrent-depth models at inference, but also suggest that
such models can be naturally viewed as strong continuous, though causal,
diffusion language models.
