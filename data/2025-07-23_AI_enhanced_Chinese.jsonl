Designed and\nimplemented by eSapiens, the system ingests heterogeneous content (PDF, Office,\nweb), splits it into 1,000-token overlapping chunks, and indexes them in a\nhybrid HNSW+BM25 store. User queries are refined by GPT-4o, retrieved via\ncombined vector+BM25 search, reranked with Cohere, and answered by an LLM using\nCO-STAR prompt engineering. A LangGraph verifier enforces citation overlap,\nregenerating answers until every claim is grounded. On four LegalBench subsets,\n1000-token chunks improve Recall@50 by approximately 1 pp and hybrid+rerank\nboosts Precision@10 by approximately 7 pp; the verifier raises TRACe\nUtilization above 0.50 and limits unsupported statements to less than 3%. All\ncomponents run in containers, enforce end-to-end TLS 1.3 and AES-256. These\nresults demonstrate that the DEREK module delivers accurate, traceable, and\nproduction-ready document QA with minimal operational overhead.

The sentence pairs are composed of contrasting\nsentences, where one of the sentences concerns disadvantaged groups and the\nother advantaged groups. Using the Dutch CrowS-Pairs dataset, we show that\nvarious language models, BERTje, RobBERT, multilingual BERT, GEITje and\nMistral-7B exhibit substantial bias across the various bias categories. Using\nthe English and French versions of the CrowS-Pairs dataset, bias was evaluated\nin English (BERT and RoBERTa) and French (FlauBERT and CamemBERT) language\nmodels, and it was shown that English models exhibit the most bias, whereas\nDutch models the least amount of bias. Additionally, results also indicate that\nassigning a persona to a language model changes the level of bias it exhibits.\nThese findings highlight the variability of bias across languages and contexts,\nsuggesting that cultural and linguistic factors play a significant role in\nshaping model biases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u8377\u5170\u7248CrowS-Pairs\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8377\u5170\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u504f\u89c1\u4f46\u4f4e\u4e8e\u82f1\u8bed\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u89d2\u8272\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4f1a\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u89c1\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u504f\u89c1\u7814\u7a76\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u82f1\u8bed\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u542b9\u7c7b\u504f\u89c1\u76841463\u5bf9\u8377\u5170\u8bed\u53e5\u5b50\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5BERTje\u3001RobBERT\u7b49\u591a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u82f1\u6cd5\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u8377\u5170\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u89c1\u7a0b\u5ea6\u6700\u4f4e\uff0c\u82f1\u8bed\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u9ad8\uff1b\u89d2\u8272\u8bbe\u5b9a(persona)\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u89c1\u8f93\u51fa\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u7a0b\u5ea6\u53d7\u6587\u5316\u8bed\u5883\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u5f00\u53d1\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Our results show that, depending on task difficulty, a critical\nvision-language misalignment can emerge: vision encoders successfully capture\nphysical plausibility cues, but this information is not effectively utilized by\nthe language model, leading to failures in reasoning. This misalignment\nsuggests that the primary limitation of MLLMs in intuitive physics tasks is not\nthe vision component but the ineffective integration of visual and linguistic\ninformation.

We define a Nonunified score that quantifies such\nself-contradiction. Our empirical results reveal that the self-contradiction\nmainly arises from weak generation that fails to align with prompts, rather\nthan misunderstanding. This capability asymmetry indicates the potential of\nleveraging self-contradiction for self-improvement, where the stronger model\nunderstanding guides the weaker generation to mitigate the\ngeneration-understanding gap. Applying standard post-training methods (e.g.,\nSFT, DPO) with such internal supervision successfully improves both generation\nand unification. We discover a co-improvement effect on both generation and\nunderstanding when only fine-tuning the generation branch, a phenomenon known\nin pre-training but underexplored in post-training. Our analysis shows\nimprovements stem from better detection of false positives that are previously\nincorrectly identified as prompt-aligned. Theoretically, we show the aligned\ntraining dynamics between generation and understanding allow reduced\nprompt-misaligned generations to also improve mismatch detection in the\nunderstanding branch.

However,\nexisting evaluation frameworks fail to align well with the goals of agentic\nsearch.

Second, prior approaches tend to\nintroduce noise when extracting ground truth for end-to-end evaluations,\nleading to distorted assessments at a fine-grained level. Third, most current\nframeworks focus solely on the quality of final answers, neglecting the\nevaluation of the iterative process inherent to agentic search.

Today, almost all successful\napplications of RL for reasoning use binary reward functions that evaluate the\ncorrectness of LM outputs. Because such reward functions do not penalize\nguessing or low-confidence outputs, they often have the unintended side-effect\nof degrading calibration and increasing the rate at which LMs generate\nincorrect responses (or \"hallucinate\") in other problem domains. This paper\ndescribes RLCR (Reinforcement Learning with Calibration Rewards), an approach\nto training reasoning models that jointly improves accuracy and calibrated\nconfidence estimation. During RLCR, LMs generate both predictions and numerical\nconfidence estimates after reasoning. They are trained to optimize a reward\nfunction that augments a binary correctness score with a Brier score -- a\nscoring rule for confidence estimates that incentivizes calibrated prediction.\nWe first prove that this reward function (or any analogous reward function that\nuses a bounded, proper scoring rule) yields models whose predictions are both\naccurate and well-calibrated. We next show that across diverse datasets, RLCR\nsubstantially improves calibration with no loss in accuracy, on both in-domain\nand out-of-domain evaluations -- outperforming both ordinary RL training and\nclassifiers trained to assign post-hoc confidence scores. While ordinary RL\nhurts calibration, RLCR improves it.
