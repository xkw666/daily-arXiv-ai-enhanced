To address these\nissues, we propose a novel deep learning framework called DiffPlanner for\nboundary-constrained floor plan generation, which operates entirely in vector\nspace. Our framework is a Transformer-based conditional diffusion model that\nintegrates an alignment mechanism in training, aligning the optimization\ntrajectory of the model with the iterative design processes of designers.

To address these issues, we propose Sketch3DVE, a\nsketch-based 3D-aware video editing method to enable detailed local\nmanipulation of videos with significant viewpoint changes.

These interactions leave\nbehind digital traces, systematically captured in the form of logs. Logs, when\neffectively exploited, provide high value across industry and academia,\nsupporting critical services (e.g., recovery and security), user-centric\napplications (e.g., recommender systems), and quality-of-service improvements\n(e.g., performance optimization). Despite their importance, research on log\nusage remains fragmented across domains, and no comprehensive study currently\nconsolidates existing efforts. This paper presents a systematic survey of log\nusage, focusing on Database (DB), Data Warehouse (DW), Web, and KG logs. More\nthan 300 publications were analyzed to address three central questions: (1) do\ndifferent types of logs share common structural and functional characteristics?\n(2) are there standard pipelines for their usage? (3) which constraints and\nnon-functional requirements (NFRs) guide their exploitation?. The survey\nreveals a limited number of end-to-end approaches, the absence of\nstandardization across log usage pipelines, and the existence of shared\nstructural elements among different types of logs. By consolidating existing\nknowledge, identifying gaps, and highlighting opportunities, this survey\nprovides researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive overview of log\nusage and sheds light on promising directions for future research, particularly\nregarding the exploitation and democratization of KG logs."}

Code and data: https://github.com/tianyiniu/RotBench", "summary": "We investigate to what extent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can\naccurately identify the orientation of input images rotated 0{\\deg}, 90{\\deg},\n180{\\deg}, and 270{\\deg}. This task demands robust visual reasoning\ncapabilities to detect rotational cues and contextualize spatial relationships\nwithin images, regardless of their orientation. To evaluate MLLMs on these\nabilities, we introduce RotBench -- a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark\ncomprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively\nsimple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and\nproprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably\nidentify rotation in input images. Providing models with auxiliary information\n-- including captions, depth maps, and more -- or using chain-of-thought\nprompting offers only small and inconsistent improvements. Our results indicate\nthat most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0{\\deg}) images,\nwhile certain models are able to identify upside-down (180{\\deg}) images. None\ncan reliably distinguish between 90{\\deg} and 270{\\deg}. Simultaneously showing\nthe image rotated in different orientations leads to moderate performance gains\nfor reasoning models, while a modified setup using voting improves the\nperformance of weaker models. We further show that fine-tuning does not improve\nmodels' ability to distinguish 90{\\deg} and 270{\\deg} rotations, despite\nsubstantially improving the identification of 180{\\deg} images. Together, these\nresults reveal a significant gap between MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities\nand human perception in identifying rotation."}
