A shared-latent variational autoencoder (VAE)\nis employed to explore the potential of image generative models for\nsynthesizing unseen motion curves and simulating novel kinematics. By encoding\nthe drawing speed of trajectory points as color gradients, the same\narchitecture also supports kinematic synthesis conditioned on both trajectory\nshape and velocity profiles.

The ease of synthesizing from a generative model suggests using\n(unverified) synthetic data to augment a limited corpus of real data for the\npurpose of fine-tuning in the hope of improving performance. Unfortunately,\nhowever, the resulting positive feedback loop leads to model autophagy disorder\n(MAD, aka model collapse) that results in a rapid degradation in sample quality\nand/or diversity. In this paper, we introduce Neon (for Negative Extrapolation\nfrOm self-traiNing), a new learning method that turns the degradation from\nself-training into a powerful signal for self-improvement. Given a base model,\nNeon first fine-tunes it on its own self-synthesized data but then,\ncounterintuitively, reverses its gradient updates to extrapolate away from the\ndegraded weights. We prove that Neon works because typical inference samplers\nthat favor high-probability regions create a predictable anti-alignment between\nthe synthetic and real data population gradients, which negative extrapolation\ncorrects to better align the model with the true data distribution. Neon is\nremarkably easy to implement via a simple post-hoc merge that requires no new\nreal data, works effectively with as few as 1k synthetic samples, and typically\nuses less than 1% additional training compute. We demonstrate Neon's\nuniversality across a range of architectures (diffusion, flow matching,\nautoregressive, and inductive moment matching models) and datasets (ImageNet,\nCIFAR-10, and FFHQ). In particular, on ImageNet 256x256, Neon elevates the\nxAR-L model to a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.02 with only 0.36% additional\ntraining compute.

Foveated rendering exploits this by\ndecreasing the spatial resolution of rendered images in peripheral vision,\nreducing the rendering cost by omitting high frequency details. As foveation\nlevels increase, the rendering quality is reduced, and traditional foveated\nrendering systems tend not to preserve samples that were previously rendered at\nhigh spatial resolution in previous frames. Additionally, prior research has\nshown that saccade landing positions are distributed around a target location\nrather than landing at a single point, and that even during fixations, eyes\nperform small microsaccades around a fixation point. This creates an\nopportunity for sampling from temporally neighbouring frames with differing\nfoveal locations to reduce the required rendered size of the foveal region\nwhile achieving a higher perceived image quality.

Following this intuition, we propose a\nWeighted Reservoir Sampling technique to efficiently maintain a reservoir of\nthe perceptually relevant high quality pixel samples from previous frames and\nincorporate them into the computation of the current frame.

Further, we outline the evaluation metrics\ncommonly used for evaluating such models and present their performance across\nstandard benchmarks, while also discussing the limitations of these metrics and\nthe emerging shift toward more holistic, perception-aligned evaluation\nstrategies. Finally, drawing from our analysis, we outline the current open\nchallenges and propose a few promising future directions, laying out a\nperspective for future researchers to explore and build upon in advancing T2V\nresearch and applications."}

In this paper, we introduce MedReflect, a\ngeneralizable framework designed to inspire LLMs with a physician-like\nreflective thinking mode. MedReflect generates a single-pass reflection chain\nthat includes initial hypothesis generation, self-questioning, self-answering\nand decision refinement. This self-verified and self-reflective nature releases\nlarge language model's latent capability in medical problem-solving without\nexternal retrieval or heavy annotation. We demonstrate that MedReflect enables\ncost-efficient medical dataset construction: with merely 2,000 randomly sampled\ntraining examples and a light fine-tuning, this approach achieves notable\nabsolute accuracy improvements across a series of medical benchmarks while\ncutting annotation requirements. Our results provide evidence that LLMs can\nlearn to solve specialized medical problems via self-reflection and\nself-improve, reducing reliance on external supervision and extensive\ntask-specific fine-tuning data."}

However,\nrecent evidence indicates that this law breaks down at very large scales: the\nloss decreases more slowly than expected, which causes significant trouble for\ndeveloping large language models. In this paper, we hypothesize that the root\ncause lies in the fact that cross-entropy itself does not truly scale; instead,\nonly one of its hidden components does. To investigate this, we introduce a\nnovel decomposition of cross-entropy into three parts: Error-Entropy,\nSelf-Alignment, and Confidence. We show both theoretically and empirically that\nthis decomposition precisely captures the training dynamics and optimization\nobjectives. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets and 32 models\nspanning five orders of magnitude in size, we find that only error-entropy\nfollows a robust power-law scaling, while the other two terms remain largely\ninvariant. Moreover, error-entropy constitutes the dominant share of\ncross-entropy in small models but diminishes in proportion as models grow\nlarger. This explains why the cross-entropy scaling law appears accurate at\nsmall scales but fails at very large ones.

In this note, we formalize and generalize\nthis duality: (i) we extend SSD from the scalar-identity case to general\ndiagonal SSMs (diagonal state matrices); (ii) we show that these diagonal SSMs\nmatch the scalar case's training complexity lower bounds while supporting\nricher dynamics; (iii) we establish a necessary and sufficient condition under\nwhich an SSM is equivalent to $1$-semiseparable masked attention; and (iv) we\nshow that such duality fails to extend to standard softmax attention due to\nrank explosion. Together, these results tighten bridge between recurrent SSMs\nand Transformers, and widen the design space for expressive yet efficient\nsequence models."}

While\nrecent Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at logical inference, their ability\nto infer rationale in dynamic, collaborative settings remains under-explored.\nThis study introduces LLM-Hanabi, a novel benchmark that uses the cooperative\ngame Hanabi to evaluate the rationale inference and ToM of LLMs. Our framework\nfeatures an automated evaluation system that measures both game performance and\nToM proficiency. Across a range of models, we find a significant positive\ncorrelation between ToM and in-game success. Notably, first-order ToM\n(interpreting others' intent) correlates more strongly with performance than\nsecond-order ToM (predicting others' interpretations). These findings highlight\nthat for effective AI collaboration, the ability to accurately interpret a\npartner's rationale is more critical than higher-order reasoning. We conclude\nthat prioritizing first-order ToM is a promising direction for enhancing the\ncollaborative capabilities of future models."}

Prior work such as GVM-RAFT\naddresses this by dynamically allocating inference budget per prompt to\nminimize stochastic gradient variance under a budget constraint. Inspired by\nthis insight, we propose Reinforce-Ada, an adaptive sampling framework for\nonline RL post-training of LLMs that continuously reallocates sampling effort\nto the prompts with the greatest uncertainty or learning potential. Unlike\nconventional two-stage allocation methods, Reinforce-Ada interleaves estimation\nand sampling in an online successive elimination process, and automatically\nstops sampling for a prompt once sufficient signal is collected. To stabilize\nupdates, we form fixed-size groups with enforced reward diversity and compute\nadvantage baselines using global statistics aggregated over the adaptive\nsampling phase. Empirical results across multiple model architectures and\nreasoning benchmarks show that Reinforce-Ada accelerates convergence and\nimproves final performance compared to GRPO, especially when using the balanced\nsampling variant.

Here, we address this gap by systematically benchmarking five\nstate-of-the-art LLMs on the International Olympiad on Astronomy and\nAstrophysics (IOAA) exams, which are designed to examine deep conceptual\nunderstanding, multi-step derivations, and multimodal analysis. With average\nscores of 85.6% and 84.2%, Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5 (the two top-performing\nmodels) not only achieve gold medal level performance but also rank in the top\ntwo among ~200-300 participants in all four IOAA theory exams evaluated\n(2022-2025). In comparison, results on the data analysis exams show more\ndivergence. GPT-5 still excels in the exams with an 88.5% average score,\nranking top 10 among the participants in the four most recent IOAAs, while\nother models' performances drop to 48-76%.

Current defenses, primarily reactive and static, often\nfail to counter these search-based attacks. In this paper, we introduce ProAct,\na novel proactive defense framework designed to disrupt and mislead autonomous\njailbreaking processes. Our core idea is to intentionally provide adversaries\nwith \"spurious responses\" that appear to be results of successful jailbreak\nattacks but contain no actual harmful content. These misleading responses\nprovide false signals to the attacker's internal optimization loop, causing the\nadversarial search to terminate prematurely and effectively jailbreaking the\njailbreak. By conducting extensive experiments across state-of-the-art LLMs,\njailbreaking frameworks, and safety benchmarks, our method consistently and\nsignificantly reduces attack success rates by up to 92\\%. When combined with\nother defense frameworks, it further reduces the success rate of the latest\nattack strategies to 0\\%. ProAct represents an orthogonal defense strategy that\ncan serve as an additional guardrail to enhance LLM safety against the most\neffective jailbreaking attacks."}

The statistically correct objective\nfor preference alignment requires marginalizing over reasoning traces, but this\ncomputation is intractable in practice. A common workaround optimizes a single\nsampled trajectory, which introduces substantial gradient variance from\nstochastic trace sampling. To address this challenge, we frame preference\noptimization for LRMs through the lens of the bias--variance trade-off and\npropose Bias--Variance Optimized Preference Optimization (BVPO), a simple,\ndrop-in method that mixes two gradient estimators: a high-variance trace-based\nestimator and a low-variance empty-trace estimator obtained by disabling\nreasoning trace generation. Our theory shows that BVPO strictly reduces\ntrace-induced variance for any nontrivial mixture, provides a closed-form\nchoice of the mixing weight that minimizes mean-squared error relative to the\ntrue marginal gradient, and under standard smoothness and step-size conditions,\ntightens classical convergence bounds for stochastic gradient descent.\nEmpirically, BVPO improves alignment over the best baseline by up to 7.8 points\non AlpacaEval~2 and 6.8 points on Arena-Hard. Despite being trained only on\ngeneral conversational data, BVPO also boosts reasoning performance for base\nmodels by up to 4.0 points on the average of six math reasoning benchmarks.\nThese results identify variance from trace sampling as a key bottleneck and\ndemonstrate that directly optimizing the bias--variance trade-off yields more\nstable training and stronger overall performance."}
