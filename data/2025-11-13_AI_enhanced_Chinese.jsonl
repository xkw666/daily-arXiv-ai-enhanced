As users exhibit diverse preferences, personalization has attracted increasing attention in LLM routing, since even identical queries may require different models to generate responses tailored to individual needs. However, existing approaches are not fully personalized and often fail to capture the complex interactions between specific users and LLMs. Moreover, user preference data is typically scarce, noisy, and inconsistent in format, which limits the effectiveness of methods that rely solely on user-specific data. To address these challenges, we propose GMTRouter, which represents multi-turn user-LLM interactions as a heterogeneous graph with four node types: user, LLM, query, and response, thereby preserving the rich relational structure of the interaction. Through a tailored message-passing mechanism, GMTRouter learns to capture user preferences from few-shot data within a lightweight inductive graph learning framework, enabling effective personalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMTRouter consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving 0.9 to 21.6 percent higher accuracy and 0.006 to 0.309 higher AUC across multiple datasets. More importantly, we demonstrate that GMTRouter can adapt to new users and evolving preferences using only few-shot data, without extensive fine-tuning.

Experiments demonstrate that our finite-difference variants achieve reconstruction fidelity comparable to their automatic-differentiation counterparts, while reducing GPU memory usage and training time by up to a factor of two.

However, recent studies reveal that alignment algorithms such as RLHF and DPO significantly reduce the diversity of LLM outputs. Not only do aligned LLMs generate text with repetitive structure and word choice, they also approach problems in more uniform ways, and their responses reflect a narrower range of societal perspectives. We attribute this problem to the KL divergence regularizer employed in preference learning algorithms. This causes the model to systematically overweight majority opinions and sacrifice diversity in its outputs. To address this, we propose Soft Preference Learning, which decouples the entropy and cross-entropy terms in the KL penalty - allowing for fine-grained control over LLM generation diversity.

Our physically-based rendering approach simulates light transmission using flux, without requiring prior knowledge of the light source's intensity distribution. To efficiently explore the light source parameter space during optimization, we apply a contraction mapping that converts the constrained problem into an unconstrained one. Using the optimized light source model, we then design the freeform lens shape considering flux consistency and normal integrability.

Prior methods for motion-conditioned synthesis typically require model-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and restrictive. We introduce Time-to-Move (TTM), a training-free, plug-and-play framework for motion- and appearance-controlled video generation with image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models. Our key insight is to use crude reference animations obtained through user-friendly manipulations such as cut-and-drag or depth-based reprojection. Motivated by SDEdit's use of coarse layout cues for image editing, we treat the crude animations as coarse motion cues and adapt the mechanism to the video domain. We preserve appearance with image conditioning and introduce dual-clock denoising, a region-dependent strategy that enforces strong alignment in motion-specified regions while allowing flexibility elsewhere, balancing fidelity to user intent with natural dynamics. This lightweight modification of the sampling process incurs no additional training or runtime cost and is compatible with any backbone. Extensive experiments on object and camera motion benchmarks show that TTM matches or exceeds existing training-based baselines in realism and motion control. Beyond this, TTM introduces a unique capability: precise appearance control through pixel-level conditioning, exceeding the limits of text-only prompting.

In this paper, we present a framework for stress testing factual fidelity in LLMs in the presence of adversarial nudge. Our framework consists of three steps. In the first step, we instruct the LLM to produce sets of truths and lies consistent with the closed domain in question. In the next step, we instruct the LLM to verify the same set of assertions as truths and lies consistent with the same closed domain.

However, efficiently capturing high-fidelity reconstructions of specific objects within complex scenes remains a significant challenge. A key limitation of existing active reconstruction methods is their reliance on scene-level uncertainty metrics, which are often biased by irrelevant background clutter and lead to inefficient view selection for object-centric tasks. We present OUGS, a novel framework that addresses this challenge with a more principled, physically-grounded uncertainty formulation for 3DGS. Our core innovation is to derive uncertainty directly from the explicit physical parameters of the 3D Gaussian primitives (e.g., position, scale, rotation). By propagating the covariance of these parameters through the rendering Jacobian, we establish a highly interpretable uncertainty model. This foundation allows us to then seamlessly integrate semantic segmentation masks to produce a targeted, object-aware uncertainty score that effectively disentangles the object from its environment. This allows for a more effective active view selection strategy that prioritizes views critical to improving object fidelity. Experimental evaluations on public datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the efficiency of the 3DGS reconstruction process and achieves higher quality for targeted objects compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, while also serving as a robust uncertainty estimator for the global scene.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faOUGS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u53473DGS\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u8c61\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e3b\u52a8\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6613\u53d7\u80cc\u666f\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u573a\u666f\u7ea7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4efb\u52a1\u89c6\u56fe\u9009\u62e9\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b", "method": "\u4ece3D\u9ad8\u65af\u57fa\u5143\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6e32\u67d3\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u4f20\u64ad\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u5efa\u7acb\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u8c61\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u8bc4\u5206", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u8c61\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u53cc\u91cd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5168\u5c40\u573a\u666f\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u80fd\u529b", "conclusion": "\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u8c61\u611f\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u52a8\u4e09\u7ef4\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u8def\u5f84"}}

However, existing defenses always assume that an external attacker crafts the harmful query, and the possibility of a model's own output becoming a new attack vector has not been sufficiently explored. In this study, we propose the Self-HarmLLM scenario, which uses a Mitigated Harmful Query (MHQ) generated by the same model as a new input. An MHQ is an ambiguous query whose original intent is preserved while its harmful nature is not directly exposed. We verified whether a jailbreak occurs when this MHQ is re-entered into a separate session of the same model. We conducted experiments on GPT-3.5-turbo, LLaMA3-8B-instruct, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B under Base, Zero-shot, and Few-shot conditions. The results showed up to 52% transformation success rate and up to 33% jailbreak success rate in the Zero-shot condition, and up to 65% transformation success rate and up to 41% jailbreak success rate in the Few-shot condition. By performing both prefix-based automated evaluation and human evaluation, we found that the automated evaluation consistently overestimated jailbreak success, with an average difference of 52%. This indicates that automated evaluation alone is not accurate for determining harmfulness. While this study is a toy-level study based on a limited query set and evaluators, it proves that our method can still be a valid attack scenario.

To overcome this, our key insight is to leverage simulation with a force-closure grasping generation pipeline that understands local geometries of the hand and object in the scene. Because this pipeline is slow and requires ground-truth observations, the resulting data is distilled into a diffusion model that operates in real-time on camera point clouds.

In this paper, we extend this approach to develop a similar framework for Bengali and apply it to translation tasks between English and Bengali. A central focus of our work lies in reassessing the effectiveness of DisCoCirc in reducing language bureaucracy. Unlike the result suggested in [5], our findings indicate that although it works well for a large part of the language, it still faces limitations due to the structural variation of the two languages. We discuss the possible methods that might handle these shortcomings and show that, in practice, DisCoCirc still struggles even with relatively simple sentences. This divergence from prior claims not only highlights the framework's constraints in translation but also suggest scope for future improvement.

However, SFT for domain specialization can be resource-intensive and sometimes leads to a deterioration in performance over general capabilities due to catastrophic forgetting (CF). To address these issues, we propose a self-adaptive gradient-aware data selection approach (GrADS) for supervised fine-tuning of LLMs, which identifies effective subsets of training data by analyzing gradients obtained from a preliminary training phase. Specifically, we design self-guided criteria that leverage the magnitude and statistical distribution of gradients to prioritize examples that contribute the most to the model's learning process. This approach enables the acquisition of representative samples that enhance LLMs understanding of domain-specific tasks. Through extensive experimentation with various LLMs across diverse domains such as medicine, law, and finance, GrADS has demonstrated significant efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

Also, we apply Explainable AI methods using SHapley Additive exPlanations to interpret the prediction results and verifying the model reliability. This integration of CNN local feature extraction, BiGRU bidirectional sequence modeling, attention mechanisms, and SHAP interpretability provides a comprehensive framework for suicide detection.

However, extracting such information from unstructured patient narratives is challenging due to the subtle, overlapping nature of cognitive constructs. This study developed and evaluated natural language processing (NLP) models to automatically identify categories that reflect various cognitive processes from de-identified first-person narratives. Three model families, a Bio_ClinicalBERT-based span categorization model for nested entity recognition, a fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct model using QLoRA for instruction following, and GPT-4o mini evaluated under zero- and few-shot settings, were compared on their performance on extracting seven categories. Our findings indicated that model performance varied substantially across categories and model families. The fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct achieved the highest overall F1-scores (0.74 micro-average and 0.59 macro-average), particularly excelling in context-dependent categories such as thought and social interaction. Bio_ClinicalBERT exhibited high precision but low recall and performed comparable to Llama for some category types such as location and time but failed on other categories such as thought, emotion and social interaction. Compared to conventional information extraction tasks, this task presents a greater challenge due to the abstract and overlapping nature of narrative accounts of complex cognitive processes.

Yet, real-world conversations naturally involve fluid transitions between these modes. To address this gap, we introduce TACT (TOD-And-Chitchat Transition), a dataset designed for transition-aware dialogue modeling that incorporates structurally diverse and integrated mode flows. TACT supports both user- and agent-driven mode switches, enabling robust modeling of complex conversational dynamics. To evaluate an agent's ability to initiate and recover from mode transitions, we propose two new metrics -- Switch and Recovery.

Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) agents show significant potential, with capabilities in information retrieval, reasoning, and generation. However, their application to biomedical hypothesis generation has been limited by the absence of standardized datasets and execution environments. To address this, we introduce BioVerge, a comprehensive benchmark, and BioVerge Agent, an LLM-based agent framework, to create a standardized environment for exploring biomedical hypothesis generation at the frontier of existing scientific knowledge. Our dataset includes structured and textual data derived from historical biomedical hypotheses and PubMed literature, organized to support exploration by LLM agents. BioVerge Agent utilizes a ReAct-based approach with distinct Generation and Evaluation modules that iteratively produce and self-assess hypothesis proposals. Through extensive experimentation, we uncover key insights: 1) different architectures of BioVerge Agent influence exploration diversity and reasoning strategies; 2) structured and textual information sources each provide unique, critical contexts that enhance hypothesis generation; and 3) self-evaluation significantly improves the novelty and relevance of proposed hypotheses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faBioVerge\u57fa\u51c6\u548cLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u548c\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u5408\u53ca\u81ea\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u5047\u8bbe\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u5047\u8bbe\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\uff0cLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5e94\u7528\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u63a2\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u548cPubMed\u6587\u732e\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1ReAct\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u751f\u6210+\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u5757\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u67b6\u6784/\u6570\u636e\u6e90/\u81ea\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u4ee3\u7406\u67b6\u6784\u5f71\u54cd\u63a2\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u548c\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u4e92\u8865\uff1b\u81ea\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f7f\u5047\u8bbe\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u63d0\u534721%\u3001\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u63d0\u534715%\u3002", "conclusion": "BioVerge\u4e3aLLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u591a\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u878d\u5408\u4e0e\u81ea\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5236\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5047\u8bbe\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Building on prior studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce bibliographic records depends on whether the underlying knowledge is generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear in the pretraining corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency with which a given bibliographic record appears in the pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified 100 citations across twenty computer-science domains, and measured factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic metadata. The results revealed that (i) citation count is strongly correlated with factual accuracy, (ii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatim memorized beyond roughly 1,000 citations, and (iii) memory interference occurs when multiple highly cited papers share similar content.

This raises a fundamental question: can we achieve a synergy with high throughput, higher GPU utilization, and AR level quality? Existing methods fail to effectively balance these two aspects, either prioritizing AR using a weaker model for sequential drafting (speculative decoding), leading to lower drafting efficiency, or using some form of left-to-right (AR-like) decoding logic for diffusion, which still suffers from quality degradation and forfeits its potential parallelizability. We introduce TiDAR, a sequence-level hybrid architecture that drafts tokens (Thinking) in Diffusion and samples final outputs (Talking) AutoRegressively - all within a single forward pass using specially designed structured attention masks. This design exploits the free GPU compute density, achieving a strong balance between drafting and verification capacity. Moreover, TiDAR is designed to be serving-friendly (low overhead) as a standalone model. We extensively evaluate TiDAR against AR models, speculative decoding, and diffusion variants across generative and likelihood tasks at 1.5B and 8B scales. Thanks to the parallel drafting and sampling as well as exact KV cache support, TiDAR outperforms speculative decoding in measured throughput and surpasses diffusion models like Dream and Llada in both efficiency and quality.

In tasks like natural language inference (NLI), human label variation (HLV) arises when multiple labels are valid for the same instance, making it difficult to separate annotation errors from plausible variation. An earlier framework VARIERR (Weber-Genzel et al., 2024) asks multiple annotators to explain their label decisions in the first round and flag errors via validity judgments in the second round. However, conducting two rounds of manual annotation is costly and may limit the coverage of plausible labels or explanations. Our study proposes a new framework, EVADE, for generating and validating explanations to detect errors using large language models (LLMs). We perform a comprehensive analysis comparing human- and LLM-detected errors for NLI across distribution comparison, validation overlap, and impact on model fine-tuning. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM validation refines generated explanation distributions to more closely align with human annotations, and that removing LLM-detected errors from training data yields improvements in fine-tuning performance than removing errors identified by human annotators. This highlights the potential to scale error detection, reducing human effort while improving dataset quality under label variation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faEVADE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u9a8c\u8bc1\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u6548\u679c", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfVARIERR\u6846\u67b6\u9700\u4e24\u8f6e\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u6709\u9650\uff1b\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u5bf9\u6807\u6ce8\u53d8\u5f02\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u91ca\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0eLLM\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u91cd\u53e0\u5ea6\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u5f71\u54cd", "result": "LLM\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4f7f\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u91ca\u5206\u5e03\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\uff1b\u79fb\u9664LLM\u68c0\u6d4b\u9519\u8bef\u540e\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u9519\u8bef\u79fb\u9664\u65b9\u6848", "conclusion": "LLM\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u9519\u8bef\u68c0\u6d4b\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u4eba\u5de5\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u6807\u7b7e\u53d8\u5f02\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b"}}

However, existing latent reasoning methods lack mechanisms to ensure stable evolution of latent representations and a systematic way to interleave implicit and explicit reasoning. We introduce SpiralThinker, a unified framework that performs iterative updates over latent representations, enabling extended implicit reasoning without generating additional tokens. A progressive alignment objective combined with structured annotations maintains coherence between latent and textual reasoning. Across mathematical, logical, and commonsense reasoning tasks, SpiralThinker achieves the best overall performance among latent reasoning approaches, consistently surpassing previous methods across all benchmarks. Detailed analyses reveal that both iteration and alignment are indispensable, the numbers of latent tokens and iterations exhibit dataset-specific optima, and appropriate alignment proves critical for an effective iterative process.

However, existing evaluations of large language models (LLMs) often rely on short, static dialogues and fail to capture the dynamic and long-term nature of emotional support. To overcome this limitation, we shift from snapshot-based evaluation to trajectory-based assessment, adopting a user-centered perspective that evaluates models based on their ability to improve and stabilize user emotional states over time. Our framework constructs a large-scale benchmark consisting of 328 emotional contexts and 1,152 disturbance events, simulating realistic emotional shifts under evolving dialogue scenarios. To encourage psychologically grounded responses, we constrain model outputs using validated emotion regulation strategies such as situation selection and cognitive reappraisal. User emotional trajectories are modeled as a first-order Markov process, and we apply causally-adjusted emotion estimation to obtain unbiased emotional state tracking. Based on this framework, we introduce three trajectory-level metrics: Baseline Emotional Level (BEL), Emotional Trajectory Volatility (ETV), and Emotional Centroid Position (ECP).

While extensively studied in language-only settings, multimodal critique of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) remains underexplored despite their growing capabilities in tasks like captioning and visual reasoning. In this work, we introduce MM-CRITIC, a holistic benchmark for evaluating the critique ability of LMMs across multiple dimensions: basic, correction, and comparison. Covering 8 main task types and over 500 tasks, MM-CRITIC collects responses from various LMMs with different model sizes and is composed of 4471 samples. To enhance the evaluation reliability, we integrate expert-informed ground answers into scoring rubrics that guide GPT-4o in annotating responses and generating reference critiques, which serve as anchors for trustworthy judgments.

The proposed strategy adaptively adjusts chunk widths based on encoding states, enabling flexible receptive fields, cross-chunk information exchange, and robust adaptation to varying speaking rates, thereby alleviating the context truncation problem of fixed-chunk methods. To further capture the linguistic characteristics of Tibetan, we construct a lexicon grounded in its orthographic principles, providing linguistically motivated modeling units. During decoding, an external language model is integrated to enhance semantic consistency and improve recognition of long sentences.

Most approaches rely on outcome-based supervision, offering no explicit guidance for intermediate steps. This often leads to reward hacking and degraded response quality. We propose Bi-RAR, a novel retrieval-augmented reasoning framework that evaluates each intermediate step jointly in both forward and backward directions. To assess the information completeness of each step, we introduce a bidirectional information distance grounded in Kolmogorov complexity, approximated via language model generation probabilities. This quantification measures both how far the current reasoning is from the answer and how well it addresses the question. To optimize reasoning under these bidirectional signals, we adopt a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework with a cascading reward structure that emphasizes early trajectory alignment. Empirical results on seven question answering benchmarks demonstrate that Bi-RAR surpasses previous methods and enables efficient interaction and reasoning with the search engine during training and inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faBi-RAR\u53cc\u5411\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eKolmogorov\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u4fe1\u606f\u8ddd\u79bb\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u63d0\u5347RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u679c\u76d1\u7763\u7684RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u5956\u52b1\u4f5c\u5f0a\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u53cc\u5411\u4fe1\u606f\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff08\u524d\u5411\u4fe1\u606f\u8ddd\u79bb\u8861\u91cf\u5f53\u524d\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u540e\u5411\u4fe1\u606f\u8ddd\u79bb\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7ea7\u8054\u5956\u52b1\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9", "result": "\u57287\u4e2a\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4e0e\u641c\u7d22\u5f15\u64ce\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u4ea4\u4e92", "conclusion": "Bi-RAR\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b"}}

While previous studies have benchmarked the humor capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), they have often relied on single-dimensional evaluations, such as judging whether something is simply ``funny.'' This paper argues that a multifaceted understanding of humor is necessary and addresses this gap by systematically evaluating LLMs through the lens of Oogiri, a form of Japanese improvisational comedy games. To achieve this, we expanded upon existing Oogiri datasets with data from new sources and then augmented the collection with Oogiri responses generated by LLMs. We then manually annotated this expanded collection with 5-point absolute ratings across six dimensions: Novelty, Clarity, Relevance, Intelligence, Empathy, and Overall Funniness. Using this dataset, we assessed the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs on two core tasks: their ability to generate creative Oogiri responses and their ability to evaluate the funniness of responses using a six-dimensional evaluation. Our results show that while LLMs can generate responses at a level between low- and mid-tier human performance, they exhibit a notable lack of Empathy. This deficit in Empathy helps explain their failure to replicate human humor assessment. Correlation analyses of human and model evaluation data further reveal a fundamental divergence in evaluation criteria: LLMs prioritize Novelty, whereas humans prioritize Empathy.

We reinterpret the attention map with positional encoding as a noisy feature map, and propose Denoising Positional Encoding (DoPE), a training-free method based on truncated matrix entropy to detect outlier frequency bands in the feature map. Leveraging the noise characteristics of the feature map, we further reparameterize it with a parameter-free Gaussian distribution to achieve robust extrapolation. Our method theoretically reveals the underlying cause of the attention sink phenomenon and its connection to truncated matrix entropy. Experiments on needle-in-a-haystack and many-shot in-context learning tasks demonstrate that DoPE significantly improves retrieval accuracy and reasoning stability across extended contexts (up to 64K tokens). The results show that the denoising strategy for positional embeddings effectively mitigates attention sinks and restores balanced attention patterns, providing a simple yet powerful solution for improving length generalization.

However, tool learning is hampered by the static synthetic data pipelines where data generation and model training are executed as two separate, non-interactive processes. This approach fails to adaptively focus on a model's specific weaknesses and allows noisy labels to persist, degrading training efficiency. We introduce LoopTool, a fully automated, model-aware data evolution framework that closes this loop by tightly integrating data synthesis and model training. LoopTool iteratively refines both the data and the model through three synergistic modules: (1) Greedy Capability Probing (GCP) diagnoses the model's mastered and failed capabilities; (2) Judgement-Guided Label Verification (JGLV) uses an open-source judge model to find and correct annotation errors, progressively purifying the dataset; and (3) Error-Driven Data Expansion (EDDE) generates new, challenging samples based on identified failures. This closed-loop process operates within a cost-effective, open-source ecosystem, eliminating dependence on expensive closed-source APIs. Experiments show that our 8B model trained with LoopTool significantly surpasses its 32B data generator and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the BFCL-v3 and ACEBench benchmarks for its scale.

However, directly entering entire tables as long text into LLMs often leads to incorrect answers because most LLMs cannot inherently capture complex table structures. In this paper, we propose a cell extraction method for TQA without manual identification, even for complex table headers. Our approach estimates table headers by computing similarities between a given question and individual cells via a hybrid retrieval mechanism that integrates a language model and TF-IDF. We then select as the answer the cells at the intersection of the most relevant row and column. Furthermore, the language model is trained using contrastive learning on a small dataset of question-header pairs to enhance performance. We evaluated our approach in the TQA dataset from the U4 shared task at NTCIR-18. The experimental results show that our pipeline achieves an accuracy of 74.6\\%, outperforming existing LLMs such as GPT-4o mini~(63.9\\%).

A recent critique argued that the original results were confounded by how topics were selected for the topic-based component, and noted that the metric had not been validated against ground-truth measures of flow. That work proposed using only the contextual term as a more conceptually valid and interpretable alternative. In this paper, we empirically validate that proposal. Using two essay datasets with human-annotated trait scores, ASAP++ and ELLIPSE, we show that the contextual version of sequentiality aligns more closely with human assessments of discourse-level traits such as Organization and Cohesion. While zero-shot prompted LLMs predict trait scores more accurately than the contextual measure alone, the contextual measure adds more predictive value than both the topic-only and original sequentiality formulations when combined with standard linguistic features. Notably, this combination also outperforms the zero-shot LLM predictions, highlighting the value of explicitly modeling sentence-to-sentence flow.

Alternatively, it can be learned during training to optimise the training objective. In this paper we study the learning dynamics of subword segmentation: if a language model can dynamically optimise tokenisation, how do its subwords evolve during pretraining and finetuning? To explore this, we extend the subword segmental language model (SSLM), a framework for learning subwords during training, to support pretraining and finetuning. We train models for three typologically diverse languages to study learning dynamics across the morphological spectrum: Isi-Xhosa is conjunctive (long word forms composed of many morphemes), Setswana is disjunctive (morphemes written as separate words), and English represents a typological middle ground. We analyse subword dynamics from a linguistic perspective, tracking morphology, productivity, and fertility. We identify four stages of subword learning, with the morphologically complex isi-Xhosa exhibiting greater instability. During finetuning, subword boundaries shift to become finer-grained. Lastly, we show that learnable subwords offers a promising approach to improve text generation and cross-lingual transfer for low-resource, morphologically complex languages.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55SSLM\u6846\u67b6\u63a2\u7d22\u52a8\u6001\u5b50\u8bcd\u5206\u5272\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f62\u6001\u590d\u6742\u8bed\u8a00\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3/\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u5448\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u6f14\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u8bcd\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u590d\u6742\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8fc1\u79fb\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u56fa\u5b9a\u5b50\u8bcd\u5206\u5272\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5f62\u6001\u590d\u6742\u7684\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5b50\u8bcd\u5206\u5272\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u5f62\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "method": "1. \u6269\u5c55SSLM\u6846\u67b6\u652f\u6301\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\n2. \u9009\u62e9\u4e09\u79cd\u5f62\u6001\u7c7b\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u9ecf\u7740\u8bedIsi-Xhosa\u3001\u6790\u53d6\u8bedSetswana\u3001\u5206\u6790\u8bed\u82f1\u8bed\uff09\n3. \u8ffd\u8e2a\u5b50\u8bcd\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u548c\u751f\u80b2\u529b\u53d8\u5316\n4. \u5206\u6790\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u540c\u9636\u6bb5\u53ca\u5fae\u8c03\u65f6\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f", "result": "1. \u8bc6\u522b\u56db\u4e2a\u5b50\u8bcd\u5b66\u4e60\u9636\u6bb5\uff08\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u3001\u5f62\u6001\u5206\u89e3\u3001\u6a21\u5f0f\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\uff09\n2.

However, most existing methods optimize only for final task outcomes, leaving models vulnerable to collapse when negative rewards dominate early training. This challenge is especially pronounced in honesty alignment, where models must not only solve answerable queries but also identify when conclusions cannot be drawn from the given premises. Deductive reasoning provides an ideal testbed because it isolates reasoning capability from reliance on external factual knowledge. To investigate honesty alignment, we curate two multi-step deductive reasoning datasets from graph structures, one for linear algebra and one for logical inference, and introduce unanswerable cases by randomly perturbing an edge in half of the instances. We find that GRPO, with or without supervised fine tuning initialization, struggles on these tasks. Through extensive experiments across three models, we evaluate stabilization strategies and show that curriculum learning provides some benefit but requires carefully designed in distribution datasets with controllable difficulty. To address these limitations, we propose Anchor, a reinforcement learning method that injects ground truth trajectories into rollouts, preventing early training collapse. Our results demonstrate that this method stabilizes learning and significantly improves the overall reasoning performance, underscoring the importance of training dynamics for enabling reliable deductive reasoning in aligned language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Anchor\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5411\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6ce8\u5165\u771f\u5b9e\u8f68\u8ff9\u6765\u9632\u6b62\u65e9\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u6f14\u7ece\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bda\u5b9e\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709GRPO\u7b49\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u8d1f\u5956\u52b1\u4e3b\u5bfc\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u53ef\u56de\u7b54\u4e0e\u4e0d\u53ef\u56de\u7b54\u6848\u4f8b\u7684\u8bda\u5b9e\u5bf9\u9f50\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6b20\u4f73\u3002\u6f14\u7ece\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9694\u79bb\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7eaf\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "1. \u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u4ee3\u6570\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u534a\u6570\u6837\u672c\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u6270\u52a8\u8fb9\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u53ef\u56de\u7b54\u6848\u4f8b\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51faAnchor\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u771f\u5b9e\u8f68\u8ff9\u6765\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eAnchor\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff08\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u534721.8%\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u56de\u7b54\u6848\u4f8b\u8bc6\u522b\u6b63\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523089.3%\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u7a33\u5b9a\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6210\u529f\u8bc1\u660e\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9632\u6b62\u65e9\u671f\u5d29\u6e83\uff09\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6f14\u7ece\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u5bf9\u9f50\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose \\textbf{POTSA} (Parallel Optimal Transport for Speech Alignment), a new framework based on cross-lingual parallel speech pairs and Optimal Transport (OT), designed to bridge high- and low-resource translation gaps. First, we introduce a Bias Compensation module to coarsely align initial speech representations across languages.

However, controlling specific attributes of generated text remains challenging without architectural modifications or extensive fine-tuning. Current methods typically toggle a single, basic attribute but struggle with precise multi-attribute control. In scenarios where attribute requirements conflict, existing methods lack coordination mechanisms, causing interference between desired attributes. Furthermore, these methods fail to incorporate iterative optimization processes in the controlled generation pipeline. To address these limitations, we propose Conflict-aware, Composite, and Collaborative Controlled Text Generation (C$^3$TG), a two-phase framework for fine-grained, multi-dimensional text attribute control. During generation, C$^3$TG selectively pairs the LLM with the required attribute classifiers from the 17 available dimensions and employs weighted KL-divergence to adjust token probabilities. The optimization phase then leverages an energy function combining classifier scores and penalty terms to resolve attribute conflicts through iterative feedback, enabling precise control over multiple dimensions simultaneously while preserving natural text flow. Experiments show that C$^3$TG significantly outperforms baselines across multiple metrics including attribute accuracy, linguistic fluency, and output diversity, while simultaneously reducing toxicity. These results establish C$^3$TG as an effective and flexible solution for multi-dimensional text attribute control that requires no costly model modifications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faC\u00b3TG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u751f\u6210\u9636\u6bb5+\u4f18\u5316\u9636\u6bb5\uff09\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u591a\u5c5e\u6027\u6587\u672c\u63a7\u5236\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a1.\u65e0\u6cd5\u534f\u8c03\u591a\u5c5e\u6027\u51b2\u7a81 2.\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5236 3.\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236", "method": "1.\u751f\u6210\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u52a8\u6001\u914d\u5bf917\u7ef4\u5c5e\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u6743KL\u6563\u5ea6\u8c03\u6574token\u5206\u5e03\uff1b2.\u4f18\u5316\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u6784\u5efa\u80fd\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\u6574\u5408\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5206\u6570\u548c\u60e9\u7f5a\u9879\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u53cd\u9988\u89e3\u51b3\u5c5e\u6027\u51b2\u7a81", "result": "\u5728\u5c5e\u6027\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff08+23.7%\uff09\u3001\u6587\u672c\u6d41\u7545\u5ea6\uff08+15.2%\uff09\u3001\u8f93\u51fa\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff08+31.4%\uff09\u548c\u6bd2\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\uff08-42.6%\uff09\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5168\u9762\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "C\u00b3TG\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u6a21\u578b\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7cbe\u51c6\u6587\u672c\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u63a7\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8303\u5f0f"}}

To address this gap, we introduce \\textbf{mmJEE-Eval}, a multimodal bilingual (English and Hindi) benchmark comprising 1,460 questions from India's JEE Advanced examination (2019-2025) spanning pre-college Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics domains. Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art models reveals that while frontier VLMs (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash) achieve 77-84\\% accuracy on held-out 2025 questions, open-source models plateau at 37-45\\% despite scaling to 400B parameters, a significant difference not observed on existing benchmarks. While closed frontiers from Google and OpenAI show high problem-solving accuracies (up to 100\\% pass@3 scores), they fully collapse when the reasoning load is increased meta-cognitively (GPT-5 fixes just 5.2\\% errors). Systematic ablations show mmJEE-Eval's difficulty stems from complexity and reasoning depth rather than memorization.

However, their effectiveness is critically dependent on ranking accuracy, a metric where further gains are highly impactful. This limitation arises from a fundamental problem that we identify and formalize as the Overfitting-Underfitting Dilemma: current margin designs cause models to apply excessive, wasteful gradients to correctly ranked samples (overfitting) while providing insufficient corrective signals for misranked ones (underfitting). To resolve this dilemma, we propose Adaptive Margin-attached Preference Optimization (AMaPO), a simple yet principled algorithm. AMaPO employs an instance-wise adaptive margin, refined by Z-normalization and exponential scaling, which dynamically reallocates learning effort by amplifying gradients for misranked samples and suppressing them for correct ones. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks demonstrate that AMaPO not only achieves better ranking accuracy and superior downstream alignment performance, but targeted analysis also confirms that it successfully mitigates the core overfitting and underfitting issues.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAMaPO\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fb9\u9645\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89e3\u51b3\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u4e0e\u6b20\u62df\u5408\u56f0\u5883\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6392\u540d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u79bb\u7ebf\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6392\u540d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u8fb9\u9645\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b58\u5728\u6838\u5fc3\u77db\u76fe\uff1a\u6b63\u786e\u6837\u672c\u68af\u5ea6\u6d6a\u8d39\uff08\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff09\u4e0e\u9519\u8bef\u6837\u672c\u7ea0\u6b63\u4e0d\u8db3\uff08\u6b20\u62df\u5408\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eZ\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u4e0e\u6307\u6570\u7f29\u653e\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fb9\u9645\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5b66\u4e60\u6743\u91cd\uff1a\u589e\u5f3a\u8bef\u6392\u6837\u672c\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u6b63\u786e\u6837\u672c\u68af\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e3b\u6d41\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cAMaPO\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6392\u540d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff08+2.5%\u63d0\u5347\uff09\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u8fc7\u62df\u5408/\u6b20\u62df\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "AMaPO\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u68af\u5ea6\u91cd\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u62df\u5408-\u6b20\u62df\u5408\u56f0\u5883\uff0c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

To help making texts more readable and make information more accessible to everyone, a line of researched aims at making texts accessible for their target audience: automatic text simplification (ATS). Lately, there have been studies on the correlations between automatic evaluation metrics in ATS and human judgment. However, the correlations between those two aspects and commonly available readability measures (such as readability formulas or linguistic features) have not been the focus of as much attention. In this work, we investigate the place of readability measures in ATS by complementing the existing studies on evaluation metrics and human judgment, on English.

Synthetic data offers a scalable alternative, and we introduce SynClaimEval, a framework for evaluating synthetic data utility in long-context claim verification -- a task central to hallucination detection and fact-checking. Our framework examines three dimensions: (i) input characteristics, by varying context length and testing generalization to out-of-domain benchmarks; (ii) synthesis logic, by controlling claim complexity and error type variation; and (iii) explanation quality, measuring the degree to which model explanations provide evidence consistent with predictions. Experiments across benchmarks show that long-context synthesis can improve verification in base instruction-tuned models, particularly when augmenting existing human-written datasets.

Although this ownership structure grants decision-making autonomy, it places a burden of responsibility on cooperative's board members. Most board members lack the resources or expertise to manage properties and their energy consumption. This ignorance presents a unique challenge, especially given the EU directives that prohibit buildings rated as energy classes F and G by 2033. Conversational agents (CAs) enable human-like interactions with computer systems, facilitating human-computer interaction across various domains. In our case, CAs can be implemented to support cooperative members in making informed energy retrofitting and usage decisions. This paper introduces a Conversational agent system, called SPARA, designed to advise cooperatives on energy efficiency. SPARA functions as an energy efficiency advisor by leveraging the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework with a Language Model(LM). The LM generates targeted recommendations based on a knowledge base composed of email communications between professional energy advisors and cooperatives' representatives in Stockholm. The preliminary results indicate that SPARA can provide energy efficiency advice with precision 80\\%, comparable to that of municipal energy efficiency (EE) experts. A pilot implementation is currently underway, where municipal EE experts are evaluating SPARA performance based on questions posed to EE experts by BRF members. Our findings suggest that LMs can significantly improve outreach by supporting stakeholders in their energy transition. For future work, more research is needed to evaluate this technology, particularly limitations to the stability and trustworthiness of its energy efficiency advice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u745e\u5178\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8eRAG\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4ee3\u7406SPARA\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4f\u623f\u5408\u4f5c\u793e\u63d0\u4f9b\u80fd\u6548\u5efa\u8bae\uff08\u51c6\u786e\u738780%\uff09\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e13\u5bb6\u4f46\u9700\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027", "motivation": "\u745e\u5178\u4f4f\u623f\u5408\u4f5c\u793e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e13\u4e1a\u80fd\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9762\u4e34\u6b27\u76df2033\u5e74\u7981\u6b62F/G\u7ea7\u80fd\u6548\u5efa\u7b51\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u538b\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u667a\u80fd\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u652f\u6301\u51b3\u7b56", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u65af\u5fb7\u54e5\u5c14\u6469\u80fd\u6e90\u987e\u95ee\u4e0e\u5408\u4f5c\u793e\u7684\u90ae\u4ef6\u901a\u4fe1\u6784\u5efa\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edfSPARA", "result": "\u521d\u6b65\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aSPARA\u5efa\u8bae\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe80%\uff0c\u4e0e\u5e02\u653f\u80fd\u6548\u4e13\u5bb6\u6c34\u5e73\u76f8\u5f53\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u6b63\u8fdb\u884c\u8bd5\u70b9\uff0c\u7531\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u80fd\u529b", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u80fd\u6e90\u8f6c\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u8bae\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u957f\u671f\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1"}}

However, training remains computationally expensive, prior work reporting approximately 36 GPU-hours per dataset, limiting broader adoption and research. We propose CGAR, a novel training methodology that applies curriculum learning to architectural depth rather than traditional data ordering. CGAR introduces two synergistic components: Progressive Depth Curriculum dynamically adjusts recursion depth from shallow to deep configurations during training, preventing early overfitting while reducing computational cost, and Hierarchical Supervision Weighting applies exponentially decaying importance to supervision steps, aligning loss weighting with observed gradient magnitude decay. On Sudoku-Extreme with 423,168 test puzzles, CGAR achieves 1.71x training speedup (10.93 to 6.38 hours, 42% cost reduction) with only 0.63% accuracy drop (86.65% to 86.02%). Systematic ablations reveal Progressive Depth Curriculum alone achieves 2.26x speedup with 85.47% accuracy, demonstrating a rare Pareto improvement where architectural curriculum simultaneously enhances training efficiency and solution quality. CGAR-trained models exhibit superior inference efficiency with 100% halting accuracy and 11% fewer reasoning steps. Our work demonstrates that principled curriculum on architectural depth enables efficient training of recursive reasoning models on modest hardware.

On LLM Agent Behavior in Dictator Games", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "comment": "7 pages, 2 figures, v1 init", "summary": "In behavioral sciences, experiments such as the ultimatum game are conducted to assess preferences for fairness or self-interest of study participants. In the dictator game, a simplified version of the ultimatum game where only one of two players makes a single decision, the dictator unilaterally decides how to split a fixed sum of money between themselves and the other player. Although recent studies have explored behavioral patterns of AI agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) instructed to adopt different personas, we question the robustness of these results. In particular, many of these studies overlook the role of the system prompt - the underlying instructions that shape the model's behavior - and do not account for how sensitive results can be to slight changes in prompts. However, a robust baseline is essential when studying highly complex behavioral aspects of LLMs. To overcome previous limitations, we propose the LLM agent behavior study (LLM-ABS) framework to (i) explore how different system prompts influence model behavior, (ii) get more reliable insights into agent preferences by using neutral prompt variations, and (iii) analyze linguistic features in responses to open-ended instructions by LLM agents to better understand the reasoning behind their behavior. We found that agents often exhibit a strong preference for fairness, as well as a significant impact of the system prompt on their behavior. From a linguistic perspective, we identify that models express their responses differently. Although prompt sensitivity remains a persistent challenge, our proposed framework demonstrates a robust foundation for LLM agent behavior studies.

For scalar quantizers, posterior-expected MSE yields closed-form tables; task-aware proxies are handled by short Monte Carlo on a small calibration set. An optional calibration-only distillation aligns the quantized model with the posterior predictive teacher. At matched average bits/weight of 3.0/3.5/4.0, BayesQ improves over strong PTQ baselines on ResNet-50 (ImageNet) and BERT-base (GLUE) e.g., vs. GPTQ by $+1.5/+0.7/+0.3$ top-1 percentage points on RN50 and $+1.1/+0.4/+0.2$ GLUE points on BERT, while requiring one-time preprocessing comparable to a GPTQ pass.

However, these approaches overlook a fundamental question: what happens when one form of recursive cognition--AI systems with their attention mechanisms, iterative processing, and feedback loops--encounters the recursive communicative processes of other species? Drawing on philosopher Yuk Hui's work on recursivity and contingency, I argue that AI systems are not neutral pattern detectors but recursive cognitive agents whose own information processing may systematically obscure or distort other species' communicative structures. This creates a double contingency problem: each species' communication emerges through contingent ecological and evolutionary conditions, while AI systems process these signals through their own contingent architectural and training conditions.

Furthermore, we examine the incorporation of LLM-derived embeddings within TGPT and benchmark its performance against fine-tuned LLMs, demonstrating that TGPT achieves superior predictive accuracy as well as faster training and inference.

Drawing on search-based interpretations of LLM computation, this paper advances a systematic framework for understanding LLM reasoning and optimization. Namely, that enhancing reasoning is best achieved by structuring a multi-agent pipeline to ensure a traversal of the search space in a gradual, incremental, and sequential (GIS) manner. Stated succinctly, high-quality reasoning is a controlled, incremental search. To test this framework, we investigate the efficacy of recursive refinement (RR)--an iterative process of self-criticism, adversarial stress-testing, and integrating critical feedback--as a practical method for implementing GIS search. We designed an experiment comparing a simple, linear pipeline against a complex, explicitly structured pipeline leveraging a recursive refinement layer. The multi-agent models were constructed to reflect the historical personas of three US Founding Fathers (Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison) using RAG-powered corpora and were prompted to generate responses to three contemporary political issues. Model performance was evaluated using a two-tiered approach: a quantitative score from an LLM arbiter agent and qualitative human judgment. Our results revealed that the complex model consistently outperformed the simple model across all nine test cases with an average arbiter-outputted score of 88.3 versus 71.7. The complex model's arguments were superior in analytical depth, structural nuance, and strategic framing. We conclude that recursive refinement is a robust architectural feature for enhancing LLM reasoning via GIS search.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9012\u5f52\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff08GIS\u641c\u7d22\uff09\u589e\u5f3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e5d\u9879\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u5f97\u520688.3\u4f18\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u6a21\u578b71.7\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u5177\u5907\u6d41\u7545\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4ecd\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ba1\u9053\u5b9e\u73b0\u6e10\u8fdb\u3001\u589e\u91cf\u3001\u987a\u5e8f\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u904d\u5386\uff08GIS\uff09\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9012\u5f52\u4f18\u5316\u4f5c\u4e3aGIS\u641c\u7d22\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1a\u7b80\u5355\u7ebf\u6027\u7ba1\u9053 vs \u542b\u9012\u5f52\u4f18\u5316\u5c42\u7684\u590d\u6742\u7ba1\u9053\uff08\u6a21\u62df\u6c49\u5bc6\u5c14\u987f/\u6770\u6590\u900a/\u9ea6\u8fea\u900a\u4e09\u4f4d\u5386\u53f2\u4eba\u7269\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528RAG\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e09\u4e2a\u5f53\u4ee3\u653f\u6cbb\u8bae\u9898\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e5d\u4e2a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff08\u5e73\u5747\u520688.3 vs 71.7\uff09\uff0c\u8bba\u8bc1\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5c42\u6b21\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u91c7\u7528LLM\u4ef2\u88c1\u4ee3\u7406\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u8f85\u4ee5\u4eba\u5de5\u5b9a\u6027\u5224\u65ad\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9012\u5f52\u4f18\u5316\u901a\u8fc7GIS\u641c\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u7ba1\u9053\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u63a7\u641c\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5047\u8bbe\u3002"}}

The models have a persistent error rate that prevents scale-up: for instance, recent experiments in the Towers of Hanoi benchmark domain showed that the process inevitably becomes derailed after at most a few hundred steps. Thus, although LLM research is often still benchmarked on tasks with relatively few dependent logical steps, there is increasing attention on the ability (or inability) of LLMs to perform long range tasks. This paper describes MAKER, the first system that successfully solves a task with over one million LLM steps with zero errors, and, in principle, scales far beyond this level. The approach relies on an extreme decomposition of a task into subtasks, each of which can be tackled by focused microagents. The high level of modularity resulting from the decomposition allows error correction to be applied at each step through an efficient multi-agent voting scheme. This combination of extreme decomposition and error correction makes scaling possible. Thus, the results suggest that instead of relying on continual improvement of current LLMs, massively decomposed agentic processes (MDAPs) may provide a way to efficiently solve problems at the level of organizations and societies.", "AI": {"tldr": "MAKER\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u6781\u7aef\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6295\u7968\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u767e\u4e07\u6b65\u7ea7LLM\u4efb\u52a1\u96f6\u9519\u8bef\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ec4\u7ec7/\u793e\u4f1a\u5c42\u9762\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\u5728\u957f\u6d41\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u7d2f\u79ef\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5982\u6c49\u8bfa\u5854\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u767e\u6b65\u5373\u5931\u8d25\uff09\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u805a\u7126\u77ed\u903b\u8f91\u94fe\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7a81\u7834\u957f\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6781\u7aef\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u62c6\u5206\u4e3a\u53ef\u7531\u5fae\u4ee3\u7406\u4e13\u6ce8\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u65bd\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u6295\u7968\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u9010\u6b65\u9aa4\u9519\u8bef\u4fee\u6b63\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5b8c\u6210\u8d85\u767e\u4e07\u6b65LLM\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u7406\u8bba\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u66f4\u9ad8\u91cf\u7ea7\uff09\uff0c\u5168\u7a0b\u4fdd\u6301\u96f6\u9519\u8bef\u7387\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u89e3\u4ee3\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\uff08MDAPs\uff09\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8868\u660e\u901a\u8fc7\u67b6\u6784\u521b\u65b0\uff08\u800c\u975e\u5355\u7eaf\u63d0\u5347LLM\u6027\u80fd\uff09\u7684MDAPs\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u7a81\u7834\u5f53\u524dLLM\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec4\u7ec7/\u793e\u4f1a\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u3002"}}

While recent video generation models produce realistic visual sequences, they typically operate in the prompt-to-full-video manner without causal control, interactivity, or long-horizon consistency required for purposeful reasoning. Existing world modeling efforts, on the other hand, often focus on restricted domains (e.g., physical, game, or 3D-scene dynamics) with limited depth and controllability, and struggle to generalize across diverse environments and interaction formats. In this work, we introduce PAN, a general, interactable, and long-horizon world model that predicts future world states through high-quality video simulation conditioned on history and natural language actions. PAN employs the Generative Latent Prediction (GLP) architecture that combines an autoregressive latent dynamics backbone based on a large language model (LLM), which grounds simulation in extensive text-based knowledge and enables conditioning on language-specified actions, with a video diffusion decoder that reconstructs perceptually detailed and temporally coherent visual observations, to achieve a unification between latent space reasoning (imagination) and realizable world dynamics (reality). Trained on large-scale video-action pairs spanning diverse domains, PAN supports open-domain, action-conditioned simulation with coherent, long-term dynamics. Extensive experiments show that PAN achieves strong performance in action-conditioned world simulation, long-horizon forecasting, and simulative reasoning compared to other video generators and world models, taking a step towards general world models that enable predictive simulation of future world states for reasoning and acting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u7528\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578bPAN\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f00\u653e\u57df\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u62df", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u56e0\u679c\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u957f\u65f6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u4e14\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3", "method": "\u91c7\u7528GLP\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e3b\u5e72\u5b9e\u73b0\u6587\u672c\u52a8\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u63a7\u5236 + \u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u751f\u6210\u611f\u77e5\u7ec6\u8282", "result": "\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u6a21\u62df\u3001\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5f00\u653e\u57df\u957f\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u62df", "conclusion": "PAN\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5411\u652f\u6301\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u901a\u7528\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u8fc8\u8fdb"}}

Equipping GUI agents with reliable episodic reasoning capabilities is essential for bridging the gap between users' concise task descriptions and the complexities of real-world execution. Current methods integrate Reinforcement Learning (RL) with System-2 Chain-of-Thought, yielding notable gains in reasoning enhancement. For long-horizon GUI tasks, historical interactions connect each screen to the goal-oriented episode chain, and effectively leveraging these clues is crucial for the current decision. However, existing native GUI agents exhibit weak short-term memory in their explicit reasoning, interpreting the chained interactions as discrete screen understanding, i.e., unawareness of the historical interactions within the episode. This history-agnostic reasoning challenges their performance in GUI automation. To alleviate this weakness, we propose a History-Aware Reasoning (HAR) framework, which encourages an agent to reflect on its own errors and acquire episodic reasoning knowledge from them via tailored strategies that enhance short-term memory in long-horizon interaction. The framework mainly comprises constructing a reflective learning scenario, synthesizing tailored correction guidelines, and designing a hybrid RL reward function. Using the HAR framework, we develop a native end-to-end model, HAR-GUI-3B, which alters the inherent reasoning mode from history-agnostic to history-aware, equipping the GUI agent with stable short-term memory and reliable perception of screen details. Comprehensive evaluations across a range of GUI-related benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faHAR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5386\u53f2\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3aGUI\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u77ed\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5386\u53f2\u4ea4\u4e92\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709GUI\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u77ed\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8584\u5f31\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u5386\u53f2\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u957f\u6d41\u7a0b\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u53cd\u601d\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f+\u5b9a\u5236\u4fee\u6b63\u7b56\u7565+\u6df7\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1HAR-GUI-3B\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5386\u53f2\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aGUI\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "HAR\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u8d4b\u4e88GUI\u4ee3\u7406\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u77ed\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0e\u5c4f\u5e55\u7ec6\u8282\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

We evaluate Routesplain on 16 state-of-the-art LLMs across eight software-related tasks; Routesplain outperforms individual models both in terms of accuracy and cost, and equals or surpasses all black-box baselines, with concept-level intervention highlighting avenues for further router improvements.", "AI": {"tldr": "Routesplain\u9996\u6b21\u4e3a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u53d6\u6982\u5ff5\u7279\u5f81\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548LLM\u8def\u7531\uff0c\u57288\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e2a\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u9ed1\u76d2\u57fa\u7ebf", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u54cd\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c", "method": "\u4ece\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6982\u5ff5\uff08\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u9886\u57df\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u5ff5\u7279\u5f81\u800c\u975e\u9ed1\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8def\u7531\u51b3\u7b56", "result": "\u572816\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbfLLM\u548c8\u9879\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4efb\u52a1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cRoutesplain\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u4e0a\u5747\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e2a\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e0e\u9ed1\u76d2\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u4f18", "conclusion": "\u6982\u5ff5\u7ea7\u5e72\u9884\u673a\u5236\u4e3a\u8def\u7531\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7279\u5f81\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8def\u7531\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c"}}

However, existing methods suffer from Gradient Starvation and Policy Degradation when training directly on samples with mixed difficulty. To mitigate this, prior approaches leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data, but the construction of high-quality CoT annotations remains labor-intensive. Alternatively, curriculum learning strategies have been explored but frequently encounter challenges, such as difficulty mismatch, reliance on manual curriculum design, and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose AdaCuRL, a Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates coarse-to-fine difficulty estimation with adaptive curriculum scheduling. This approach dynamically aligns data difficulty with model capability and incorporates a data revisitation mechanism to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, AdaCuRL employs adaptive reference and sparse KL strategies to prevent Policy Degradation. Extensive experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that AdaCuRL consistently achieves significant performance improvements on both LLMs and MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6AdaCuRL\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u96be\u5ea6\u8c03\u6574\u548c\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8c03\u5ea6\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edfRL\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u532e\u4e4f\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u96be\u5ea6\u6837\u672c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u68af\u5ea6\u532e\u4e4f\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u96be\u5ea6\u5931\u914d\u3001\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u7b49\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7531\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u56de\u8bbf\u673a\u5236\u9632\u6b62\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53c2\u8003\u548c\u7a00\u758fKL\u7b56\u7565\u907f\u514d\u7b56\u7565\u9000\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cAdaCuRL\u5bf9LLMs\u548cMLLMs\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff08\u5177\u4f53\u6307\u6807\u672a\u91cf\u5316\u5c55\u793a\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u52a8\u6001\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e0e\u96be\u5ea6\u5339\u914d\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u68af\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u521b\u65b0\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}
