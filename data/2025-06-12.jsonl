In this paper, we come up with\nthe observation that a specific LLM exhibits notable diversity after being\npruned on different calibration datasets, based on which we present a\nDiversity-Enhanced reconstruction method named DIVE. The recipe of DIVE\nincludes domain affinity mining, pruning-based expert reconstruction, and\nefficient retraining. Specifically, the reconstruction includes pruning and\nreassembly of the feed-forward network (FFN) module. After reconstruction, we\nefficiently retrain the model on routers, experts and normalization modules.

Preliminary studies observe that the hidden activations of LLMs\noften resemble English, even when responding to non-English prompts. This has\nled to the widespread assumption that LLMs may \"think\" in English. However,\nmore recent results showing strong multilingual performance, even surpassing\nEnglish performance on specific tasks in other languages, challenge this view.\nIn this work, we find that LLMs progressively develop a core language-agnostic\nparameter space-a remarkably small subset of parameters whose deactivation\nresults in significant performance degradation across all languages. This\ncompact yet critical set of parameters underlies the model's ability to\ngeneralize beyond individual languages, supporting the emergence of abstract\nthought that is not tied to any specific linguistic system. Specifically, we\nidentify language-related neurons-those are consistently activated during the\nprocessing of particular languages, and categorize them as either shared\n(active across multiple languages) or exclusive (specific to one). As LLMs\nundergo continued development over time, we observe a marked increase in both\nthe proportion and functional importance of shared neurons, while exclusive\nneurons progressively diminish in influence. These shared neurons constitute\nthe backbone of the core language-agnostic parameter space, supporting the\nemergence of abstract thought.

Extending this task to a\nvisually grounded dialogue setting based on videos, a conversational model must\nboth recognize pertinent visual details over time and answer questions where\nthe required information is not necessarily present in the visual information.\nMoreover, the context of the overall conversation must be considered for the\nsubsequent dialogue. To explore this task, we introduce a dataset comprised of\n$2,017$ videos with $5,986$ human-annotated dialogues consisting of $40,954$\ninterleaved dialogue turns. While the dialogue context is visually grounded in\nspecific video segments, the questions further require external knowledge that\nis not visually present. Thus, the model not only has to identify relevant\nvideo parts but also leverage external knowledge to converse within the\ndialogue. We further provide several baselines evaluated on our dataset and\nshow future challenges associated with this task. The dataset is made publicly\navailable here: https://github.com/c-patsch/OKCV."}

Xiao", "Johannes Zenn", "Zhen Liu", "Weiyang Liu", "Robert Bamler", "Bernhard Schölkopf"], "title": "Flipping Against All Odds: Reducing LLM Coin Flip Bias via Verbalized Rejection Sampling", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CL"], "comment": "Technical Report v1 (21 pages, 14 figures)", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) can often accurately describe probability\ndistributions using natural language, yet they still struggle to generate\nfaithful samples from them. This mismatch limits their use in tasks requiring\nreliable stochasticity, such as Monte Carlo methods, agent-based simulations,\nand randomized decision-making. We investigate this gap between knowledge and\nsampling in the context of Bernoulli distributions. We introduce Verbalized\nRejection Sampling (VRS), a natural-language adaptation of classical rejection\nsampling that prompts the LLM to reason about and accept or reject proposed\nsamples. Despite relying on the same Bernoulli mechanism internally, VRS\nsubstantially reduces sampling bias across models. We provide theoretical\nanalysis showing that, under mild assumptions, VRS improves over direct\nsampling, with gains attributable to both the algorithm and prompt design. More\nbroadly, our results show how classical probabilistic tools can be verbalized\nand embedded into LLM workflows to improve reliability, without requiring\naccess to model internals or heavy prompt engineering."}
