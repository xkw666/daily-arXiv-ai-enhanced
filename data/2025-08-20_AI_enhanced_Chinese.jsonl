However, editing the structural content of 3D scenes\nin videos remains challenging, particularly when dealing with significant\nviewpoint changes, such as large camera rotations or zooms. Key challenges\ninclude generating novel view content that remains consistent with the original\nvideo, preserving unedited regions, and translating sparse 2D inputs into\nrealistic 3D video outputs. To address these issues, we propose Sketch3DVE, a\nsketch-based 3D-aware video editing method to enable detailed local\nmanipulation of videos with significant viewpoint changes. To solve the\nchallenge posed by sparse inputs, we employ image editing methods to generate\nedited results for the first frame, which are then propagated to the remaining\nframes of the video. We utilize sketching as an interaction tool for precise\ngeometry control, while other mask-based image editing methods are also\nsupported. To handle viewpoint changes, we perform a detailed analysis and\nmanipulation of the 3D information in the video. Specifically, we utilize a\ndense stereo method to estimate a point cloud and the camera parameters of the\ninput video. We then propose a point cloud editing approach that uses depth\nmaps to represent the 3D geometry of newly edited components, aligning them\neffectively with the original 3D scene. To seamlessly merge the newly edited\ncontent with the original video while preserving the features of unedited\nregions, we introduce a 3D-aware mask propagation strategy and employ a video\ndiffusion model to produce realistic edited videos.

The observation initiates\nthe design of a low frequency domain filtering module for filtering out the\ndocument-level features that are sensitive to domain shift, and a dynamic\nspectrum alignment strategy to extract the task-specific and domain-invariant\nfeatures for improving the detector's performance in domain generalization.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that MGT-Prism outperforms state-of-the-art\nbaselines by an average of 0.90% in accuracy and 0.92% in F1 score on 11 test\ndatasets across three domain-generalization scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u9891\u57df\u5206\u6790\u7684MGT-Prism\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u9891\u6ee4\u6ce2\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u9891\u8c31\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5b58\u5728\u9886\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u6587\u672c\u5728\u9891\u57df\u5b58\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u5149\u8c31\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u800c\u673a\u5668\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6587\u672c\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u9891\u8c31\u5dee\u5f02", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4f4e\u9891\u57df\u6ee4\u6ce2\u6a21\u5757\u53bb\u9664\u9886\u57df\u654f\u611f\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u9891\u8c31\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u53d6\u9886\u57df\u65e0\u5173\u7279\u5f81", "result": "\u572811\u4e2a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53470.90%\uff0cF1\u503c\u63d0\u53470.92%", "conclusion": "\u9891\u57df\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u9886\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd"}}

We identify several\nkey challenges: metrics often capture only specific aspects of text quality,\ntheir effectiveness varies by task and dataset, validation practices remain\nunstructured, and correlations with human judgment are inconsistent.\nImportantly, we find that these challenges persist in the most recent type of\nmetric, LLM-as-a-Judge, as well as in the evaluation of Retrieval Augmented\nGeneration (RAG), an increasingly relevant task in academia and industry. Our\nfindings challenge the quest for the 'perfect metric'. We propose selecting\nmetrics based on task-specific needs and leveraging complementary evaluations\nand advocate that new metrics should focus on enhanced validation\nmethodologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u7ef4\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u6839\u636e\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\u7ec4\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\u5e76\u52a0\u5f3a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5", "motivation": "\u63ed\u793a\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff08AEM\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u5bf9'\u5b8c\u7f8e\u6307\u6807'\u7684\u8ffd\u6c42", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5ba1\u67e5\u73b0\u6709\u6307\u6807\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u5f0f\u548c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6307\u6807\u6709\u6548\u6027\u53d7\u4efb\u52a1/\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5f71\u54cd\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u5f0f\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001LLM-as-a-Judge\u548cRAG\u8bc4\u4f30\u540c\u6837\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u9677", "conclusion": "\u5e94\u57fa\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\u9009\u62e9\u6307\u6807\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u5f00\u53d1\u9700\u805a\u7126\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdb\u800c\u975e\u8ffd\u6c42\u901a\u7528\u6027"}}

Recent studies have explored fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs)\nwith synthetic data to enhance their long-context capabilities. However, the\neffectiveness of such approaches is often limited by the low diversity and\nfactual inconsistencies in the generated data. To address these challenges, we\npropose LongMab-PO, a novel framework that leverages a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)\nrollout strategy to identify the most informative chunks from the given long\ncontext for sampling high-quality and diverse responses and constructing\npreference data pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training.\nSpecifically, we treat context chunks as arms of MAB, select chunks based on\ntheir expected reward scores to input into LLMs to generate responses, and\niteratively update these scores based on reward feedback.

The sophisticated\nanalysis of patient-generated health content, which contains complex emotional\nand medical contexts, requires scarce domain expertise, while traditional ML\napproaches are constrained by data shortage and privacy limitations in\nhealthcare settings. Online Health Communities (OHCs) exemplify these\nchallenges with mixed-sentiment posts, clinical terminology, and implicit\nemotional expressions that demand specialised knowledge for accurate Sentiment\nAnalysis (SA). To address these challenges, this study explores how Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) can integrate expert knowledge through in-context\nlearning for SA, providing a scalable solution for sophisticated health data\nanalysis. Specifically, we develop a structured codebook that systematically\nencodes expert interpretation guidelines, enabling LLMs to apply\ndomain-specific knowledge through targeted prompting rather than extensive\ntraining. Six GPT models validated alongside DeepSeek and LLaMA 3.1 are\ncompared with pre-trained language models (BioBERT variants) and lexicon-based\nmethods, using 400 expert-annotated posts from two OHCs.

Given that online and city council\ndiscourse reflect and influence part of public opinion, it provides valuable\ninsights to identify and track social biases. This research contributes to\nalleviating homelessness by acting on public opinion. It introduces novel\nmethods, building on natural language processing (NLP) and large language\nmodels (LLMs), to identify and measure PEH social bias expressed in digital\nspaces. We present a new, manually-annotated multi-modal dataset compiled from\nReddit, X (formerly Twitter), news articles, and city council meeting minutes\nacross 10 U.S. cities. This unique dataset provides evidence of the typologies\nof homelessness bias described in the literature. In order to scale up and\nautomate the detection of homelessness bias online, we evaluate LLMs as\nclassifiers. We applied both zero-shot and few-shot classification techniques\nto this data. We utilized local LLMs (Llama 3.2 3B Instruct, Qwen 2.5 7B\nInstruct, and Phi4 Instruct Mini) as well as closed-source API models (GPT-4.1,\nGemini 2.5 Pro, and Grok-4). Our findings reveal that although there are\nsignificant inconsistencies in local LLM zero-shot classification, the\nin-context learning classification scores of local LLMs approach the\nclassification scores of closed-source LLMs. Furthermore, LLMs outperform BERT\nwhen averaging across all categories.

To address this, we propose L3AE, the first integration of\nLLMs into the LAE framework.

This paper presents a systematic survey of log\nusage, focusing on Database (DB), Data Warehouse (DW), Web, and KG logs.

(3) which constraints and\nnon-functional requirements (NFRs) guide their exploitation?. The survey\nreveals a limited number of end-to-end approaches, the absence of\nstandardization across log usage pipelines, and the existence of shared\nstructural elements among different types of logs.

This task demands robust visual reasoning\ncapabilities to detect rotational cues and contextualize spatial relationships\nwithin images, regardless of their orientation. To evaluate MLLMs on these\nabilities, we introduce RotBench -- a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark\ncomprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively\nsimple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and\nproprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably\nidentify rotation in input images. Providing models with auxiliary information\n-- including captions, depth maps, and more -- or using chain-of-thought\nprompting offers only small and inconsistent improvements. Our results indicate\nthat most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0{\\deg}) images,\nwhile certain models are able to identify upside-down (180{\\deg}) images. None\ncan reliably distinguish between 90{\\deg} and 270{\\deg}. Simultaneously showing\nthe image rotated in different orientations leads to moderate performance gains\nfor reasoning models, while a modified setup using voting improves the\nperformance of weaker models. We further show that fine-tuning does not improve\nmodels' ability to distinguish 90{\\deg} and 270{\\deg} rotations, despite\nsubstantially improving the identification of 180{\\deg} images.
