The temporal coherence inherent in these tasks presents an opportunity to reuse intermediate results from previous frames and avoid redundant computations. Recent work has shown that caching intermediate features to be reused in subsequent inferences is an effective method to reduce latency in diffusion models. We extend this idea to real-time rendering and present ReFrame, which explores different caching policies to optimize trade-offs between quality and performance in rendering workloads. ReFrame can be applied to a variety of encoder-decoder style networks commonly found in rendering pipelines. Experimental results show that we achieve 1.4x speedup on average with negligible quality loss in three real-time rendering tasks.

However, there still lacks a comprehensive metric for assessing the editing quality. Existing metrics either require high human evaluation costs, which hinder large-scale evaluation, or are adapted from other tasks and lose task-specific concerns, failing to comprehensively evaluate both instruction-based modification and preservation of irrelevant regions, resulting in biased evaluation. To tackle this, we introduce a new metric called Balancing Preservation and Modification (BPM), tailored for instruction-based image editing by explicitly disentangling the image into editing-relevant and irrelevant regions for specific consideration. We first identify and locate editing-relevant regions, followed by a two-tier process to assess editing quality: Region-Aware Judge evaluates whether the position and size of the edited region align with the instruction, and Semantic-Aware Judge further assesses the instruction content compliance within editing-relevant regions as well as content preservation within irrelevant regions, yielding comprehensive and interpretable quality assessment. Moreover, the editing-relevant region localization in BPM can be integrated into image editing approaches to improve editing quality, demonstrating its broad applicability. We verify the effectiveness of the BPM metric on comprehensive instruction-editing data, and the results show the highest alignment with human evaluation compared to existing metrics, indicating its efficacy.

However, existing methods often rely on either high-poly mesh modeling with post-hoc simplification or massive 3D Gaussians, resulting in a complex pipeline or limited visual realism. In this paper, we demonstrate that such exhaustive modeling is unnecessary for achieving compelling immersive experience. We introduce ImmerseGen, a novel agent-guided framework for compact and photorealistic world modeling. ImmerseGen represents scenes as hierarchical compositions of lightweight geometric proxies, i.e., simplified terrain and billboard meshes, and generates photorealistic appearance by synthesizing RGBA textures onto these proxies. Specifically, we propose terrain-conditioned texturing for user-centric base world synthesis, and RGBA asset texturing for midground and foreground scenery.This reformulation offers several advantages: (i) it simplifies modeling by enabling agents to guide generative models in producing coherent textures that integrate seamlessly with the scene; (ii) it bypasses complex geometry creation and decimation by directly synthesizing photorealistic textures on proxies, preserving visual quality without degradation; (iii) it enables compact representations suitable for real-time rendering on mobile VR headsets. To automate scene creation from text prompts, we introduce VLM-based modeling agents enhanced with semantic grid-based analysis for improved spatial reasoning and accurate asset placement. ImmerseGen further enriches scenes with dynamic effects and ambient audio to support multisensory immersion. Experiments on scene generation and live VR showcases demonstrate that ImmerseGen achieves superior photorealism, spatial coherence and rendering efficiency compared to prior methods.

Natural language processing technologies, represented by Large Language Models (LLMs), have been widely applied to climate change-specific research, providing essential information support for decision-makers and the public. Some studies have improved model performance on relevant tasks by constructing climate change-related instruction data and instruction-tuning LLMs. However, current research remains inadequate in efficiently producing large volumes of high-precision instruction data for climate change, which limits further development of climate change LLMs. This study introduces an automated method for constructing instruction data. The method generates instructions using facts and background knowledge from documents and enhances the diversity of the instruction data through web scraping and the collection of seed instructions. Using this method, we constructed a climate change instruction dataset, named ClimateChat-Corpus, which was used to fine-tune open-source LLMs, resulting in an LLM named ClimateChat.

The current trend in HAR relies on marker tracking technology. However, marker-based systems have several limitations, such as difficulty in use and installation, sensitivity to light, and marker design. In this paper, we propose a markerless HAR framework with GeoPose-based tracking. We use different gestures for manipulation and achieve 7 DOF (3 DOF each for translation and rotation, and 1 DOF for scaling). The proposed framework, called GHAR, is implemented for architectural building models. It augments virtual CAD models of buildings on the ground, enabling users to manipulate and visualize an architectural model before actual construction. The system offers a quick view of the building infrastructure, playing a vital role in requirement analysis and planning in construction technology. We evaluated the usability, manipulability, and comprehensibility of the proposed system using a standard user study with the System Usability Scale (SUS) and Handheld Augmented Reality User Study (HARUS).

While humans consistently learn to navigate this diversity, large language models (LLMs) struggle with linguistic-mathematical puzzles involving cross-linguistic numeral systems, which humans can learn to solve successfully. We investigate why this task is difficult for LLMs through a series of experiments that untangle the linguistic and mathematical aspects of numbers in language. Our experiments establish that models cannot consistently solve such problems unless the mathematical operations in the problems are explicitly marked using known symbols ($+$, $\\times$, etc, as in \"twenty + three\"). In further ablation studies, we probe how individual parameters of numeral construction and combination affect performance. While humans use their linguistic understanding of numbers to make inferences about the implicit compositional structure of numerals, LLMs seem to lack this notion of implicit numeral structure.

These methods remain a fundamental component of modern applications. However, animatable digital asset creation predominantly remains a manual process. Current automated tools often fall short of delivering the desired level of quality for intricate and complex geometries, requiring manual touch-ups. We propose a fully automatic and robust method for generating high quality skinning weights given a user-provided skeleton and mesh in A- or T-pose. Notably, our approach provides direct sparsity controls, limiting the number of bone influences per vertex, which is essential for efficient asset creation for large-scale mobile experiences with multiple concurrent users. Our method additionally addresses the need for level-of-detail (LoD) variations in performance-sensitive applications, which are exacerbated on mobile platforms. By optimizing weights in space rather than on discrete points, we enable a single optimization result to be seamlessly applied to all levels of detail of that asset or even variations of that asset. To achieve this, we introduce a novel parameterized family of functions called SkinCells. We demonstrate how our automatic method is able to robustly compute skinning weights in cases where biharmonic weight computation fails.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8499\u76ae\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7a00\u758f\u9aa8\u9abc\u5f71\u54cd\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u591a\u7ec6\u8282\u5c42\u6b21\u9002\u914d\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u79fb\u52a8\u7aef\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u573a\u666f", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8499\u76ae\u6743\u91cd\u751f\u6210\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u52a8\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u4f53\u65f6\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u79fb\u52a8\u7aef\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e94\u7528\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u591a\u7ec6\u8282\u5c42\u6b21\u652f\u6301", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u53c2\u6570\u5316SkinCells\u51fd\u6570\u65cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6743\u91cd\u5728\u591a\u7ec6\u8282\u5c42\u6b21\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u7684\u65e0\u7f1d\u8fc1\u79fb\u5e94\u7528", "result": "\u5728\u53cc\u8c03\u548c\u6743\u91cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u4ecd\u80fd\u7a33\u5065\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u8d28\u8499\u76ae\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6bcf\u9876\u70b9\u9aa8\u9abc\u5f71\u54cd\u6570\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\u53ef\u8de8\u4e0d\u540cLOD\u5c42\u7ea7\u590d\u7528", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u89d2\u8272\u8d44\u4ea7\u521b\u5efa\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u7528\u6237\u5e76\u53d1\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u7aef\u5b9e\u65f6\u52a8\u753b\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5b9e\u65f6\u89d2\u8272\u52a8\u753b\u5236\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u9769\u65b0"}}

The Vision-Language Reward Model (VL-RM) is key to aligning VL models by providing structured feedback, yet training effective VL-RMs faces two major challenges. First, the bootstrapping dilemma arises as high-quality training data depends on already strong VL models, creating a cycle where self-generated supervision reinforces existing biases. Second, modality bias and negative example amplification occur when VL models hallucinate incorrect visual attributes, leading to flawed preference data that further misguides training.

Despite advancements in emotional text-to-speech (TTS) techniques, task-oriented emotional SDSs remain underexplored due to the compartmentalized nature of SDS and emotional TTS research, as well as the lack of standardized evaluation metrics for social goals. We address these challenges by developing an emotional SDS for news conversations that utilizes a large language model (LLM)-based sentiment analyzer to identify appropriate emotions and PromptTTS to synthesize context-appropriate emotional speech. We also propose subjective evaluation scale for emotional SDSs and judge the emotion regulation performance of the proposed and baseline systems. Experiments showed that our emotional SDS outperformed a baseline system in terms of the emotion regulation and engagement. These results suggest the critical role of speech emotion for more engaging conversations.

As large language models (LLMs) enter high-stakes domains like education, healthcare, governance, and law, their behavior must reliably reflect human-aligned values and safety constraints. Yet current evaluations rely heavily on behavioral proxies such as refusal rates, G-Eval scores, and toxicity classifiers, all of which have critical blind spots. Aligned models are often vulnerable to jailbreaking, stochasticity of generation, and alignment faking.\n  To address this issue, we introduce the Alignment Quality Index (AQI). This novel geometric and prompt-invariant metric empirically assesses LLM alignment by analyzing the separation of safe and unsafe activations in latent space. By combining measures such as the Davies-Bouldin Score (DBS), Dunn Index (DI), Xie-Beni Index (XBI), and Calinski-Harabasz Index (CHI) across various formulations, AQI captures clustering quality to detect hidden misalignments and jailbreak risks, even when outputs appear compliant. AQI also serves as an early warning signal for alignment faking, offering a robust, decoding invariant tool for behavior agnostic safety auditing.\n  Additionally, we propose the LITMUS dataset to facilitate robust evaluation under these challenging conditions. Empirical tests on LITMUS across different models trained under DPO, GRPO, and RLHF conditions demonstrate AQI's correlation with external judges and ability to reveal vulnerabilities missed by refusal metrics.

Current AI systems based on large language models (LLMs) can provide feedback that makes people feel heard. Yet it remains unclear whether LLMs represent emotion in language as humans do, or whether and how the emotional tone of their output can be controlled. We assess human-AI emotional alignment across linguistic-cultural groups and model-families, using interpretable LLM features translated from concept-sets for over twenty nuanced emotion categories (including six basic emotions). Our analyses reveal that LLM-derived emotion spaces are structurally congruent with human perception, underpinned by the fundamental affective dimensions of valence and arousal. Furthermore, these emotion-related features also accurately predict large-scale behavioural data on word ratings along these two core dimensions, reflecting both universal and language-specific patterns. Finally, by leveraging steering vectors derived solely from human-centric emotion concepts, we show that model expressions can be stably and naturally modulated across distinct emotion categories, which provides causal evidence that human emotion concepts can be used to systematically induce LLMs to produce corresponding affective states when conveying content. These findings suggest AI not only shares emotional representations with humans but its affective outputs can be precisely guided using psychologically grounded emotion concepts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u60c5\u611f\u6982\u5ff5\u53ef\u7cbe\u786e\u8c03\u63a7AI\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "motivation": "\u9a8c\u8bc1LLM\u662f\u5426\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5171\u4eab\u60c5\u611f\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u60c5\u611f\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u53ef\u8c03\u63a7\u6027\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u4ea4\u6d41\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6587\u5316\u7fa4\u4f53\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4f7f\u752820+\u60c5\u611f\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u89e3\u91caLLM\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5bf9\u6548\u4ef7/\u5524\u9192\u5ea6\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "LLM\u60c5\u611f\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u7ed3\u6784\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u60c5\u611f\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u884c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u7c7b\u60c5\u611f\u5bfc\u5411\u5411\u91cf\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u8868\u8fbe\u8c03\u63a7\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5171\u4eab\u4eba\u7c7b\u60c5\u611f\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u66f4\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u6982\u5ff5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f15\u5bfc\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u63a7\u60c5\u611f\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Smith", "Sewoong Oh"], "title": "Sampling from Your Language Model One Byte at a Time", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.FL", "cs.LG"], "comment": "23 pages, 8 figures", "summary": "Tokenization is used almost universally by modern language models, enabling efficient text representation using multi-byte or multi-character tokens. However, prior work has shown that tokenization can introduce distortion into the model's generations. For example, users are often advised not to end their prompts with a space because it prevents the model from including the space as part of the next token. This Prompt Boundary Problem (PBP) also arises in languages such as Chinese and in code generation, where tokens often do not line up with syntactic boundaries. Additionally mismatching tokenizers often hinder model composition and interoperability. For example, it is not possible to directly ensemble models with different tokenizers due to their mismatching vocabularies. To address these issues, we present an inference-time method to convert any autoregressive LM with a BPE tokenizer into a character-level or byte-level LM, without changing its generative distribution at the text level. Our method efficient solves the PBP and is also able to unify the vocabularies of language models with different tokenizers, allowing one to ensemble LMs with different tokenizers at inference time as well as transfer the post-training from one model to another using proxy-tuning. We demonstrate in experiments that the ensemble and proxy-tuned models outperform their constituents on downstream evals.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u5c06BPE\u5206\u8bcd\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5b57\u7b26/\u5b57\u8282\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u8bcd\u9519\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u5408\u5e94\u7528", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u4e0d\u540c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8fb9\u754c\u95ee\u9898(PBP)\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u5408\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u5dee\u7b49\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u4fdd\u6301\u6587\u672c\u5c42\u9762\u751f\u6210\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5c06BPE\u5206\u8bcd\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5b57\u7b26\u7ea7/\u5b57\u8282\u7ea7\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u7edf\u4e00\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\uff0c\u7ec4\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u8c03\u4f18\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u539f\u6a21\u578b", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u8bcd\u9519\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf"}}

In this work, our observation is that the differences between the preferred response $y^+$ and dispreferred response $y^-$ influence what LLMs can learn, which may not match the desirable differences to learn. Therefore, we use distance and reward margin to quantify these differences, and combine them to get Distance Calibrated Reward Margin (DCRM), a metric that measures the quality of a response pair for PO. Intuitively, DCRM encourages minimal noisy differences and maximal desired differences. With this, we study 3 types of commonly used preference datasets, classified along two axes: the source of the responses and the preference labeling function. We establish a general correlation between higher DCRM of the training set and better learning outcome. Inspired by this, we propose a best-of-$N^2$ pairing method that selects response pairs with the highest DCRM.

However, their autoregressive nature leads to substantial inference latency, posing challenges for real-time applications.

Existing approaches, however, overlook the inherent coherence in text generation, limiting their efficiency. To address this gap, we propose a Speculative Sampling with Syntactic and Semantic Coherence (S$^4$C) framework, which extends speculative sampling by leveraging multi-head drafting for rapid token generation and a continuous verification tree for efficient candidate validation and feature reuse. Experimental results demonstrate that S$^4$C surpasses baseline methods across mainstream tasks, offering enhanced efficiency, parallelism, and the ability to generate more valid tokens with fewer computational resources.

Evaluating this bias is challenging, as conventional direct-query methods are susceptible to social desirability effects and fail to capture its subtle, multi-dimensional nature. To this end, we propose an evaluation framework that leverages the Stereotype Content Model (SCM) to reconceptualize bias as a multi-dimensional failure in ToM across Competence, Sociability, and Morality. The framework introduces two indirect tasks: the Word Association Bias Test (WABT) to assess implicit lexical associations and the Affective Attribution Test (AAT) to measure covert affective leanings, both designed to probe latent stereotypes without triggering model avoidance.

Our three-stage process (1) trains decoder self-attention and feedforward layers on code-switched text, (2) aligns decoder and encoder via cross-attention using limited speech-text data, and (3) fully fine-tunes the entire model. Experiments with Whisper on Malay-English code-switching demonstrate a 9.02% relative WER reduction, while improving monolingual performance in Singlish, Malay, and other English variants.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAsyncSwitch\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4ee3\u7801\u5207\u6362\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u9a6c\u6765\u8bed-\u82f1\u8bed\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b09.02%\u8bcd\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4ee3\u7801\u5207\u6362ASR\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u532e\u4e4f\u548c\u5408\u6210\u97f3\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1a1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7801\u5207\u6362\u6587\u672c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42 2) \u7528\u6709\u9650\u8bed\u97f3\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668 3) \u5b8c\u6574\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03", "result": "\u9a6c\u6765\u8bed-\u82f1\u8bed\u4ee3\u7801\u5207\u6362\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5bf9WER\u964d\u4f4e9.02%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u65b0\u52a0\u5761\u82f1\u8bed\u3001\u9a6c\u6765\u8bed\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u82f1\u8bed\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u5355\u8bed\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "AsyncSwitch\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u9002\u914d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8bed\u8a00ASR\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Identifying the intended target item from patient's circumlocution involves the two challenges of term failure and error: (1) The terms relevant to identifying the item remain unseen. (2) What makes the challenge unique is inherent perturbed terms by semantic paraphasia, which are not exactly related to the target item, hindering the identification process. To address each, we propose robustifying the model from semantically paraphasic errors and enhancing the model with unseen terms with gradient-based selective augmentation. Specifically, the gradient value controls augmented data quality amid semantic errors, while the gradient variance guides the inclusion of unseen but relevant terms.

Leveraging information asymmetry, AgentSynth constructs subtasks that are simple during generation but significantly more challenging when composed into long-horizon tasks, enabling the creation of over 6,000 diverse and realistic tasks. Our pipeline begins with an LLM-based task proposer guided by a persona, followed by an execution agent that completes the task and logs the trajectory. This process is repeated iteratively to form a sequence of subtasks, which are then summarized by a separate agent into a composite task of controllable difficulty. A key strength of AgentSynth is its ability to precisely modulate task complexity by varying the number of subtasks. Empirical evaluations show that state-of-the-art LLM agents suffer a steep performance drop, from 18% success at difficulty level 1 to just 4% at level 6, highlighting the benchmark's difficulty and discriminative power. Moreover, our pipeline achieves a low average cost of \\$0.60 per trajectory, orders of magnitude cheaper than human annotations.

However, obtaining high-quality data remains challenging, with data privacy issues presenting a significant hurdle. To address the need for high-quality data. Synthesize data has emerged as a mainstream solution, demonstrating impressive performance in areas such as images, audio, and video. Generating mixed-type data, especially high-quality tabular data, still faces significant challenges. These primarily include its inherent heterogeneous data types, complex inter-variable relationships, and intricate column-wise distributions. In this paper, we introduce CausalDiffTab, a diffusion model-based generative model specifically designed to handle mixed tabular data containing both numerical and categorical features, while being more flexible in capturing complex interactions among variables. We further propose a hybrid adaptive causal regularization method based on the principle of Hierarchical Prior Fusion. This approach adaptively controls the weight of causal regularization, enhancing the model's performance without compromising its generative capabilities.

While models have become proficient at detecting explicit patterns, which typically appear in texts as single remarks referred to as utterances, such as social media posts, malicious actors have shifted toward utilizing implicit influential verbal patterns embedded within conversations. These verbal patterns aim to mentally penetrate the victim's mind in order to influence them, enabling the actor to obtain the desired information through implicit means. This paper presents an improved approach for detecting such implicit influential patterns. Furthermore, the proposed model is capable of identifying the specific locations of these influential elements within a conversation. To achieve this, the existing dataset was augmented using the reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art language models. Our designed framework resulted in a 6% improvement in the detection of implicit influential patterns in conversations.

For example in TRC, we need to understand the temporal semantic differences between the following two questions that are lexically near-identical: \"What finished right before the decision?\" or \"What finished right after the decision?\". To discern the two questions, existing solutions have relied on answer overlaps as a proxy label to contrast similar and dissimilar questions. However, we claim that answer overlap can lead to unreliable results, due to spurious overlaps of two dissimilar questions with coincidentally identical answers. To address the issue, we propose a novel approach that elicits proper reasoning behaviors through a module for predicting time spans of events. We introduce the Timeline Reasoning Network (TRN) operating in a two-step inductive reasoning process: In the first step model initially answers each question with semantic and syntactic information. The next step chains multiple questions on the same event to predict a timeline, which is then used to ground the answers. Results on the TORQUE and TB-dense, TRC and TRE tasks respectively, demonstrate that TRN outperforms previous methods by effectively resolving the spurious overlaps using the predicted timeline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u7ebf\u63a8\u7406\u7f51\u7edc(TRN)\u7684\u4e24\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u65f6\u5e8f\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7b54\u6848\u91cd\u53e0\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b54\u6848\u91cd\u53e0\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4ee3\u7406\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u5076\u7136\u6027\u76f8\u540c\u7b54\u6848\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bef\u5224\u3002\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65f6\u95f4\u8de8\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u5efa\u7acb\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "1. \u521d\u6b65\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u53e5\u6cd5\u4fe1\u606f\u56de\u7b54\u95ee\u9898\uff1b2. \u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u95ee\u9898\u94fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u6784\u5efa\u65f6\u95f4\u7ebf\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u7ebf\u4fee\u6b63\u7b54\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5728TORQUE\u548cTB-dense\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cTRN\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u7b54\u6848\u91cd\u53e0\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u865a\u5047\u5173\u8054\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u95f4\u7ebf\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65f6\u5e8f\u903b\u8f91\u94fe\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

In contrast, expert problem solvers - such as Olympiad or programming contest teams - leverage a rich tapestry of experiences: absorbing mentorship from coaches, developing intuition from past problems, leveraging knowledge of tool usage and library functionality, adapting strategies based on the expertise and experiences of peers, continuously refining their reasoning through trial and error, and learning from other related problems even during competition. We introduce Xolver, a training-free multi-agent reasoning framework that equips a black-box LLM with a persistent, evolving memory of holistic experience. Xolver integrates diverse experience modalities, including external and self-retrieval, tool use, collaborative interactions, agent-driven evaluation, and iterative refinement. By learning from relevant strategies, code fragments, and abstract reasoning patterns at inference time, Xolver avoids generating solutions from scratch - marking a transition from isolated inference toward experience-aware language agents. Built on both open-weight and proprietary models, Xolver consistently outperforms specialized reasoning agents. Even with lightweight backbones (e.g., QWQ-32B), it often surpasses advanced models including Qwen3-235B, Gemini 2.5 Pro, o3, and o4-mini-high.

However, this approach fails to account for the relationship between tool and word tokens, limiting adaptability within pre-trained LLMs. To address this issue, we propose a novel token learning method that aligns tool tokens with the existing word embedding space from the perspective of initialization, thereby enhancing model performance.

This ensures the learned embeddings are well-aligned with the word token space, improving tool call accuracy. We evaluate the method on tasks such as numerical reasoning, knowledge-based question answering, and embodied plan generation using GSM8K-XL, FuncQA, KAMEL, and VirtualHome datasets.

However, these agents often generate short-sighted responses that fail to sustain user guidance and meet expectations. Although preference optimization has proven effective in aligning LLMs with user expectations, it remains costly and performs poorly in multi-turn dialogue. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel multi-turn preference optimization (MTPO) paradigm ECPO, which leverages Expectation Confirmation Theory to explicitly model the evolution of user satisfaction throughout multi-turn dialogues, uncovering the underlying causes of dissatisfaction. These causes can be utilized to support targeted optimization of unsatisfactory responses, thereby achieving turn-level preference optimization. ECPO ingeniously eliminates the significant sampling overhead of existing MTPO methods while ensuring the optimization process drives meaningful improvements. To support ECPO, we introduce an LLM-based user simulator, AILO, to simulate user feedback and perform expectation confirmation during conversational recommendations.

However, this variation is often overlooked in summarization evaluation. While having multiple reference summaries is known to improve correlation with human judgments, the impact of using different reference sets on reference-based metrics has not been systematically investigated. This work examines the sensitivity of widely used reference-based metrics in relation to the choice of reference sets, analyzing three diverse multi-reference summarization datasets: SummEval, GUMSum, and DUC2004. We demonstrate that many popular metrics exhibit significant instability. This instability is particularly concerning for n-gram-based metrics like ROUGE, where model rankings vary depending on the reference sets, undermining the reliability of model comparisons. We also collect human judgments on LLM outputs for genre-diverse data and examine their correlation with metrics to supplement existing findings beyond newswire summaries, finding weak-to-no correlation.

To evaluate retrieval beyond these shallow signals, recent benchmarks introduce reasoning-heavy queries; however, they primarily shift the burden to query-side processing techniques -- like prompting or multi-hop retrieval -- that can help resolve complexity. In contrast, we present ImpliRet, a benchmark that shifts the reasoning challenge to document-side processing: The queries are simple, but relevance depends on facts stated implicitly in documents through temporal (e.g., resolving \"two days ago\"), arithmetic, and world knowledge relationships.

We explain both phenomena through the lens of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) scaling theory. Building on these observations, we propose LongLLaDA, a training-free method that integrates LLaDA with the NTK-based RoPE extrapolation. Our results validate that established extrapolation scaling laws remain effective for extending the context windows of diffusion LLMs. Furthermore, we identify long-context tasks where diffusion LLMs outperform auto-regressive LLMs and others where they fall short.

Existing benchmarks primarily assess static knowledge, while intelligence also entails the ability to rapidly learn from experience.

In this work, we propose semantic games as effective testbeds for evaluating test-time learning, due to their resistance to saturation and inherent demand for strategic reasoning. We introduce an objective evaluation framework that compares model performance under both limited and cumulative experience settings, and contains four forms of experience representation. To provide a comparative baseline, we recruit eight human participants to complete the same task. Results show that LLMs exhibit measurable test-time learning capabilities; however, their improvements are less stable under cumulative experience and progress more slowly than those observed in humans.

Verifying whether a specific LLM was trained on particular data instances or an entire dataset is extremely challenging. Dataset watermarking addresses this by embedding identifiable modifications in training data to detect unauthorized use. However, existing methods often lack stealth, making them relatively easy to detect and remove. In light of these limitations, we propose LexiMark, a novel watermarking technique designed for text and documents, which embeds synonym substitutions for carefully selected high-entropy words. Our method aims to enhance an LLM's memorization capabilities on the watermarked text without altering the semantic integrity of the text. As a result, the watermark is difficult to detect, blending seamlessly into the text with no visible markers, and is resistant to removal due to its subtle, contextually appropriate substitutions that evade automated and manual detection. We evaluated our method using baseline datasets from recent studies and seven open-source models: LLaMA-1 7B, LLaMA-3 8B, Mistral 7B, Pythia 6.9B, as well as three smaller variants from the Pythia family (160M, 410M, and 1B).

Attackers can exploit this by inducing excessive output, leading to resource exhaustion and service degradation. Prior energy-latency attacks aim to increase generation time by broadly shifting the output token distribution away from the EOS token, but they neglect the influence of token-level Part-of-Speech (POS) characteristics on EOS and sentence-level structural patterns on output counts, limiting their efficacy. To address this, we propose LingoLoop, an attack designed to induce MLLMs to generate excessively verbose and repetitive sequences. First, we find that the POS tag of a token strongly affects the likelihood of generating an EOS token. Based on this insight, we propose a POS-Aware Delay Mechanism to postpone EOS token generation by adjusting attention weights guided by POS information. Second, we identify that constraining output diversity to induce repetitive loops is effective for sustained generation. We introduce a Generative Path Pruning Mechanism that limits the magnitude of hidden states, encouraging the model to produce persistent loops. Extensive experiments demonstrate LingoLoop can increase generated tokens by up to 30 times and energy consumption by a comparable factor on models like Qwen2.5-VL-3B, consistently driving MLLMs towards their maximum generation limits.

While it is common to assign a uniform decay rate to every layer, this approach overlooks the structural diversity of LLMs and the varying spectral properties across modules. In this paper, we introduce AlphaDecay, a simple yet effective method that adaptively assigns different weight decay strengths to each module of an LLM. Our approach is guided by Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR) theory, which analyzes the empirical spectral density (ESD) of weight correlation matrices to quantify \"heavy-tailedness.\" Modules exhibiting more pronounced heavy-tailed ESDs, reflecting stronger feature learning, are assigned weaker decay, while modules with lighter-tailed spectra receive stronger decay. Our method leverages tailored weight decay assignments to balance the module-wise differences in spectral properties, leading to improved performance.

Moreover, existing attribution methods do not explain how and why models leverage the provided source documents to generate their final responses, limiting interpretability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a modular generation framework, GenerationPrograms, inspired by recent advancements in executable \"code agent\" architectures. Unlike conventional generation methods that simultaneously generate outputs and attributions or rely on post-hoc attribution, GenerationPrograms decomposes the process into two distinct stages: first, creating an executable program plan composed of modular text operations (such as paraphrasing, compression, and fusion) explicitly tailored to the query, and second, executing these operations following the program's specified instructions to produce the final response. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that GenerationPrograms significantly improves attribution quality at both the document level and sentence level across two long-form question-answering tasks and a multi-document summarization task. We further demonstrate that GenerationPrograms can effectively function as a post-hoc attribution method, outperforming traditional techniques in recovering accurate attributions. In addition, the interpretable programs generated by GenerationPrograms enable localized refinement through modular-level improvements that further enhance overall attribution quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6GenerationPrograms\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8ba1\u5212\u4e0e\u6267\u884c\u673a\u5236\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5f52\u56e0\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u6e90\u6587\u6863\u751f\u6210\u54cd\u5e94", "method": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u6839\u636e\u67e5\u8be2\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u64cd\u4f5c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8ba1\u5212\uff08\u6539\u5199/\u538b\u7f29/\u878d\u5408\u7b49\uff09\uff1b2) \u6309\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6307\u4ee4\u6267\u884c\u64cd\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u6700\u7ec8\u54cd\u5e94", "result": "\u5728\u957f\u95ee\u7b54\u548c\u591a\u6587\u6863\u6458\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u6587\u6863\u7ea7\u548c\u53e5\u5b50\u7ea7\u5f52\u56e0\u8d28\u91cf\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e8b\u540e\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6a21\u5757\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\u6539\u8fdb", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u5206\u89e3\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5f52\u56e0\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316\u67b6\u6784\u652f\u6301\u5c40\u90e8\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4e8b\u540e\u5f52\u56e0\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

Our method generates candidate translations using an LLM from one ISA to another, and embeds such translations within a software-testing framework to build quantifiable confidence in the translation. We evaluate our GG approach over two diverse datasets, enforce high code coverage (>98%) across unit tests, and achieve functional/semantic correctness of 99% on HumanEval programs and 49% on BringupBench programs, respectively. Further, we compare our approach to the state-of-the-art Rosetta 2 framework on Apple Silicon, showcasing 1.73x faster runtime performance, 1.47x better energy efficiency, and 2.41x better memory usage for our transpiled code, demonstrating the effectiveness of GG for real-world CISC-to-RISC translation tasks.

In this work, we investigate whether adding semantic information in the form of an Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) helps pretrained language models better generalize in NLI.

Due to their linguistic capacities, it is possible that LLMs are an efficient alternative to time-consuming manual coding and the pre-training of supervised machine learning models. As most existing research on this topic has focused on English-language responses relating to non-complex topics or on single LLMs, it is unclear whether its findings generalize and how the quality of these classifications compares to established methods. In this study, we investigate to what extent different LLMs can be used to code open-ended survey responses in other contexts, using German data on reasons for survey participation as an example. We compare several state-of-the-art LLMs and several prompting approaches, and evaluate the LLMs' performance by using human expert codings. Overall performance differs greatly between LLMs, and only a fine-tuned LLM achieves satisfactory levels of predictive performance. Performance differences between prompting approaches are conditional on the LLM used. Finally, LLMs' unequal classification performance across different categories of reasons for survey participation results in different categorical distributions when not using fine-tuning. We discuss the implications of these findings, both for methodological research on coding open-ended responses and for their substantive analysis, and for practitioners processing or substantively analyzing such data. Finally, we highlight the many trade-offs researchers need to consider when choosing automated methods for open-ended response classification in the age of LLMs. In doing so, our study contributes to the growing body of research about the conditions under which LLMs can be efficiently, accurately, and reliably leveraged in survey research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u5728\u5fb7\u8bed\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u95ee\u5377\u5e94\u7b54\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5177\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22LLM\u80fd\u5426\u66ff\u4ee3\u8017\u65f6\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u975e\u82f1\u8bed\u590d\u6742\u8bed\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6548\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5fb7\u56fd\u8c03\u67e5\u53c2\u4e0e\u539f\u56e0\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u591a\u79cd\u524d\u6cbfLLM\u53ca\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e13\u5bb6\u4eba\u5de5\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4ec5\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u5230\u7406\u60f3\u9884\u6d4b\u6c34\u5e73\uff1b\u63d0\u793a\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u672a\u5fae\u8c03\u65f6\u5206\u7c7b\u504f\u5dee\u5bfc\u81f4\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u5e94\u7b54\u5206\u7c7b\u9700\u6743\u8861\u6548\u7387\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u53ca\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u7ed3\u679c\u6709\u51b3\u5b9a\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Through systematic experiments, we find that for recent strong models such as the Qwen2.5 series, adding traditional CoT exemplars does not improve reasoning performance compared to Zero-Shot CoT. Instead, their primary function is to align the output format with human expectations. We further investigate the effectiveness of enhanced CoT exemplars, constructed using answers from advanced models such as \\texttt{Qwen2.5-Max} and \\texttt{DeepSeek-R1}.

However, their performance is limited by the small number of trainable parameters. Recent work combines LoRA with the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), i.e., LoRA-MoE, to enhance capacity, but two limitations remain in hindering the full exploitation of its potential: 1) the influence of downstream tasks when assigning expert numbers, and 2) the uniform rank assignment across all LoRA experts, which restricts representational diversity. To mitigate these gaps, we propose GuiLoMo, a fine-grained layer-wise expert numbers and ranks allocation strategy with GuidedSelection Vectors (GSVs). GSVs are learned via a prior bilevel optimization process to capture both model- and task-specific needs, and are then used to allocate optimal expert numbers and ranks.

Large general-purpose models are trained for many tasks, but work best on high-frequency use cases. After training, it is hard to adapt a model to perform well on specific use cases underrepresented in the training corpus. Relying on prompt engineering or few-shot examples to maximize the output quality on a particular test case can be frustrating, as models can be highly sensitive to small changes, react in unpredicted ways or rely on a fixed system prompt for maintaining performance. In this work, we ask: \"Can we optimize our training protocols to both improve controllability and performance on underrepresented use cases at inference time?\" We revisit the divide between training and inference techniques to improve long-tail performance while providing users with a set of control levers the model is trained to be responsive to. We create a detailed taxonomy of data characteristics and task provenance to explicitly control generation attributes and implicitly condition generations at inference time. We fine-tune a base model to infer these markers automatically, which makes them optional at inference time. This principled and flexible approach yields pronounced improvements in performance, especially on examples from the long tail of the training distribution. While we observe an average lift of 5.7% win rates in open-ended generation quality with our markers, we see over 9.1% gains in underrepresented domains. We also observe relative lifts of up to 14.1% on underrepresented tasks like CodeRepair and absolute improvements of 35.3% on length instruction following evaluations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u636e\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u9690\u5f0f\u6761\u4ef6\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u5c3e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u5c3e/\u4f4e\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7528\u4f8b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4f20\u7edf\u8bad\u7ec3-\u63a8\u7406\u754c\u9650\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u63a7\u4f18\u5316", "method": "1. \u521b\u5efa\u6570\u636e\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u6765\u6e90\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\n2. \u5fae\u8c03\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u52a8\u63a8\u65ad\u7279\u5f81\u6807\u8bb0\n3. \u652f\u6301\u663e\u5f0f\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u9690\u5f0f\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210", "result": "\u5e73\u5747\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u53475.7%\uff08\u957f\u5c3e\u9886\u57df9.1%\uff09\uff0cCodeRepair\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u534714.1%\uff0c\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u534735.3%\u7edd\u5bf9\u503c", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u6807\u8bb0\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u573a\u666f\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf"}}

Built upon the publicly available Ling-lite model, a 16.8 billion parameter model with 2.75 billion activated parameters, our approach matches the performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) small-scale reasoning models on challenging benchmarks (e.g., AIME, LiveCodeBench, GPQA-Diamond) while activating only one-third of the parameters required by comparable models. To accomplish this, we introduce a joint training pipeline integrating distillation with RL, revealing undocumented challenges in MoE RL training. First, we identify optimization instability during RL training, and we propose Constrained Contextual Computation Policy Optimization(C3PO), a novel approach that enhances training stability and improves computational throughput via algorithm-system co-design methodology.

Despite recent advances in enhancing language model (LM) reasoning, most methods lean toward exploitation, and increasingly encounter performance plateaus. In this work, we revisit entropy -- a signal of exploration in RL -- and examine its relationship to exploratory reasoning in LMs. Through empirical analysis, we uncover strong positive correlations between high-entropy regions and three types of exploratory reasoning actions: (1) pivotal tokens that determine or connect logical steps, (2) reflective actions such as self-verification and correction, and (3) rare behaviors under-explored by the base LMs. Motivated by this, we introduce a minimal modification to standard RL with only one line of code: augmenting the advantage function with an entropy-based term. Unlike traditional maximum-entropy methods which encourage exploration by promoting uncertainty, we encourage exploration by promoting longer and deeper reasoning chains.

Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) and similar schemes split text once, build a static vocabulary, and leave the model stuck with that choice. We relax this rigidity by introducing an autoregressive U-Net that learns to embed its own tokens as it trains. The network reads raw bytes, pools them into words, then pairs of words, then up to 4 words, giving it a multi-scale view of the sequence. At deeper stages, the model must predict further into the future -- anticipating the next few words rather than the next byte -- so deeper stages focus on broader semantic patterns while earlier stages handle fine details.

However, since speech is continuous and complex, it is often discretized for autoregressive modeling. Speech tokens derived from self-supervised models (known as semantic tokens) typically focus on the linguistic aspects of speech but neglect prosodic information. As a result, models trained on these tokens can generate speech with reduced naturalness. Existing approaches try to fix this by adding pitch features to the semantic tokens. However, pitch alone cannot fully represent the range of paralinguistic attributes, and selecting the right features requires careful hand-engineering. To overcome this, we propose an end-to-end variational approach that automatically learns to encode these continuous speech attributes to enhance the semantic tokens. Our approach eliminates the need for manual extraction and selection of paralinguistic features. Moreover, it produces preferred speech continuations according to human raters.

Quantization offers a solution, yet performance degradation in the sub-1-bit regime remains particularly difficult. This paper introduces LittleBit, a novel method for extreme LLM compression. It targets levels like 0.1 bits per weight (BPW), achieving nearly 31$\\times$ memory reduction, e.g., Llama2-13B to under 0.9 GB. LittleBit represents weights in a low-rank form using latent matrix factorization, subsequently binarizing these factors. To counteract information loss from this extreme precision, it integrates a multi-scale compensation mechanism. This includes row, column, and an additional latent dimension that learns per-rank importance. Two key contributions enable effective training: Dual Sign-Value-Independent Decomposition (Dual-SVID) for stable quantization-aware training (QAT) initialization, and integrated Residual Compensation to mitigate errors. Extensive experiments confirm LittleBit's superiority in sub-1-bit quantization: e.g., its 0.1 BPW performance on Llama2-7B surpasses the leading method's 0.7 BPW. This establishes a superior size-performance trade-off, with kernel-level benchmarks indicating potential for a 5$\\times$ speedup compared to FP16.

We also introduce \"paper-cards\", concise paper summaries under 300 characters, which enhance BM25 retrieval, increasing MRR@3 from 0.56 to 0.85 on simplified technical queries.\n  For multihop tasks, our reranking method reaches an F1 score of 0.52 with LLaMA2-Chat-7B on the LongBench 2WikiMultihopQA dataset, surpassing chunking and fine-tuned baselines which score 0.328 and 0.412 respectively.\n  This method eliminates fine-tuning requirements, reduces retrieval latency, enables intuitive question-driven knowledge access, and decreases vector storage demands by 80%, positioning it as a scalable and efficient RAG alternative.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u95ee\u9898\u751f\u6210\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u5757\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u5b58\u50a8\u9700\u6c42", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u5206\u5757\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u5b58\u50a8\u9700\u6c42\u5927\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u5ef6\u8fdf\u957f\u7b49\u95ee\u9898", "method": "1. \u751f\u6210\u8986\u76d6\u8bcd\u6c47\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u4f5c\u4e3a\u68c0\u7d22\u7ebf\u7d22\n2. \u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u53e5\u6cd5\u91cd\u6392\u65b9\u6cd5\n3. \u521b\u5efa300\u5b57\u7b26\u5185\u7684\u8bba\u6587\u6458\u8981\u5361\u7247\uff08paper-cards\uff09", "result": "\u5355\u8df3\u68c0\u7d22Recall@3\u8fbe0.84\uff08\u63d0\u534760%\uff09\uff0cBM25\u68c0\u7d22MRR@3\u4ece0.56\u5347\u81f30.85\uff0c\u591a\u8df3\u4efb\u52a1F1\u8fbe0.52\uff08\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u5b58\u50a8\u9700\u6c42\u964d\u4f4e80%", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u964d\u4f4e80%\u5b58\u50a8\u9700\u6c42\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u68c0\u7d22\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u95ee\u9898\u9a71\u52a8\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848"}}

We find that RLVR drives performance through two main means: (1) by compressing pass@$k$ into pass@1 and (2) via \"capability gain\" in which models learn to solve new problems that they previously could not solve even at high $k$. We find that while capability gain exists across model scales, learning to solve new problems is primarily driven through self-distillation. We demonstrate these findings across model scales ranging from 0.5B to 72B on >500,000 reasoning problems with prompts and verifiable final answers across math, science, and code domains. We further show that we can significantly improve pass@$k$ rates by leveraging natural language guidance for the model to consider within context while still requiring the model to derive a solution chain from scratch. Based of these insights, we derive $\\text{Guide}$ - a new class of online training algorithms. $\\text{Guide}$ adaptively incorporates hints into the model's context on problems for which all rollouts were initially incorrect and adjusts the importance sampling ratio for the \"off-policy\" trajectories in order to optimize the policy for contexts in which the hints are no longer present. We describe variants of $\\text{Guide}$ for GRPO and PPO and empirically show that Guide-GRPO on 7B and 32B parameter models improves generalization over its vanilla counterpart with up to 4$\\%$ macro-average improvement across math benchmarks.

To answer this question, we introduce AssistedDS (Assisted Data Science), a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate how LLMs handle domain knowledge in tabular prediction tasks. AssistedDS features both synthetic datasets with explicitly known generative mechanisms and real-world Kaggle competitions, each accompanied by curated bundles of helpful and adversarial documents. These documents provide domain-specific insights into data cleaning, feature engineering, and model selection. We assess state-of-the-art LLMs on their ability to discern and apply beneficial versus harmful domain knowledge, evaluating submission validity, information recall, and predictive performance. Our results demonstrate three key findings: (1) LLMs frequently exhibit an uncritical adoption of provided information, significantly impairing their predictive performance when adversarial content is introduced, (2) helpful guidance is often insufficient to counteract the negative influence of adversarial information, and (3) in Kaggle datasets, LLMs often make errors in handling time-series data, applying consistent feature engineering across different folds, and interpreting categorical variables correctly.

In parallel, the rise of LLM-based chat interfaces has raised user expectations, encouraging users to pose more complex queries that necessitate retrieval by ``reasoning'' over documents rather than through simple keyword matching or semantic similarity. While some recent efforts have exploited reasoning abilities of LLMs for reranking such queries, considerable potential for improvement remains. In that regards, we introduce InsertRank, an LLM-based reranker that leverages lexical signals like BM25 scores during reranking to further improve retrieval performance.

However, a critical paradox clouds its efficacy: RLVR-tuned models often underperform their base models on the $Pass@K$ metric for solution-finding, leading to the hypothesis that RLVR merely re-weights existing reasoning paths at the cost of reasoning diversity. In this work, we resolve this contradiction by identifying the source of the problem: the $Pass@K$ metric itself is a flawed measure of reasoning, as it credits correct final answers that probably arise from inaccurate or incomplete chains of thought (CoTs). To address this, we introduce a more precise evaluation metric, $CoT$-$Pass@K$, which mandates that both the reasoning path and the final answer be correct. We provide a new theoretical foundation that formalizes how RLVR, unlike traditional RL, is uniquely structured to incentivize logical integrity. Our empirical results are supportive: using $CoT$-$Pass@K$, we observe that RLVR can incentivize the generalization of correct reasoning for all values of $K$. Furthermore, by analyzing the training dynamics, we find that this enhanced reasoning capability emerges early in the training process and smoothly generalizes.

Moreover, Bayesian methods also increase computational overheads and require additional tricks for them to work well. Here, we fix these issues by using a recently proposed variational algorithm called IVON. We show that IVON is easy to implement and has similar costs to AdamW, and yet it can also drastically improve many metrics by using a simple posterior pruning technique. We present extensive results on billion-scale LLMs (Llama and Qwen series) going way beyond the scale of existing applications of IVON. For example, we finetune a Llama-3.2-3B model on a set of commonsense reasoning tasks and improve accuracy over AdamW by 1.3% and reduce ECE by 5.4%, outperforming AdamW and other recent Bayesian methods like Laplace-LoRA and BLoB.

However, it is challenging to leverage such token-level reward as guidance for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), since DPO is formulated as a sequence-level bandit problem. To address this challenge, this work decomposes the sequence-level PPO into a sequence of token-level proximal policy optimization problems and then frames the problem of token-level PPO with token-level reward guidance, from which closed-form optimal token-level policy and the corresponding token-level reward can be derived. Using the obtained reward and Bradley-Terry model, this work establishes a framework of computable loss functions with token-level reward guidance for DPO, and proposes a practical reward guidance based on the induced DPO reward. This formulation enables different tokens to exhibit varying degrees of deviation from reference policy based on their respective rewards. Experiment results demonstrate that our method achieves substantial performance improvements over DPO, with win rate gains of up to 7.5 points on MT-Bench, 6.2 points on AlpacaEval 2, and 4.3 points on Arena-Hard.

Despite its rapid growth and algorithmic relevance, the field of computational studies in influencer marketing remains fragmented, especially with limited systematic reviews covering the computational methodologies employed. This makes overarching scientific measurements in the influencer economy very scarce, to the detriment of interested stakeholders outside of platforms themselves, such as regulators, but also researchers from other fields. This paper aims to provide an overview of the state of the art of computational studies in influencer marketing by conducting a systematic literature review (SLR) based on the PRISMA model. The paper analyses 69 studies to identify key research themes, methodologies, and future directions in this research field. The review identifies four major research themes: Influencer identification and characterisation, Advertising strategies and engagement, Sponsored content analysis and discovery, and Fairness. Methodologically, the studies are categorised into machine learning-based techniques (e.g., classification, clustering) and non-machine-learning-based techniques (e.g., statistical analysis, network analysis). Key findings reveal a strong focus on optimising commercial outcomes, with limited attention to regulatory compliance and ethical considerations. The review highlights the need for more nuanced computational research that incorporates contextual factors such as language, platform, and industry type, as well as improved model explainability and dataset reproducibility.

We identify a core aspect of this issue as \"invalid thinking\" -- models tend to repeatedly double-check their work after having derived the correct answer. To address this specific inefficiency, we move beyond the general principles of Efficacy and Efficiency to propose two new, fine-grained principles: Brevity, which advocates for eliminating redundancy, and Sufficiency, which ensures critical reasoning steps are preserved. Guided by these principles, we introduce LC-R1, a post-training method based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). LC-R1 employs a novel combination of a Length Reward for overall conciseness and a Compress Reward that is specifically designed to remove the invalid portion of the thinking process. Extensive experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that LC-R1 achieves a significant reduction in sequence length (~50%) with only a marginal (~2%) drop in accuracy, achieving a favorable trade-off point on the Pareto frontier that prioritizes high compression. Our analysis further validates the robustness of LC-R1 and provides valuable insights for developing more powerful yet computationally efficient LRMs. Our code is released at https://github.com/zxiangx/LC-R1.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLC-R1\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u65e0\u6548\u601d\u7ef4\u51cf\u5c11\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u51cf\u5c1150%\u4e14\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4ec5\u4e0b\u964d2%", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u65e0\u6548\u91cd\u590d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u65e0\u6548\u601d\u7ef4\u73b0\u8c61\uff09", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eGRPO\u6846\u67b6\u5f00\u53d1LC-R1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u957f\u5ea6\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u538b\u7f29\u5956\u52b1\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u538b\u7f29\u7ea650%\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4ec5\u4e0b\u964d2%", "conclusion": "Brevity\u4e0eSufficiency\u539f\u5219\u6307\u5bfc\u7684LC-R1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u5411"}}

They over-rely on partial cues and generate incorrect responses. Recently, methods like Visual Contrastive Decoding (VCD) and Instruction Contrastive Decoding (ICD) have been proposed to mitigate hallucinations by contrasting predictions from perturbed or negatively prefixed inputs against original outputs. In this work, we uncover that methods like VCD and ICD fundamentally influence internal attention dynamics of the model. This observation suggests that their effectiveness may not stem merely from surface-level modifications to logits but from deeper shifts in attention distribution. Inspired by this insight, we propose an attention-steerable contrastive decoding framework that directly intervenes in attention mechanisms of the model to offer a more principled approach to mitigating hallucinations. Our experiments across multiple MLLM architectures and diverse decoding methods demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces hallucinations and improves the performance on benchmarks such as POPE, CHAIR, and MMHal-Bench, while simultaneously enhancing performance on standard VQA benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u7801\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u5e72\u9884\u6a21\u578b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5VCD\u548cICD\u7684\u6548\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u6e90\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u6539\u53d8\u800c\u975e\u8868\u9762logits\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u8fd9\u542f\u53d1\u4e86\u66f4\u6839\u672c\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6848", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53ef\u8c03\u63a7\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u7801\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5c42\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u5e72\u9884", "result": "\u5728POPE/CHAIR/MMHal-Bench\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u6807\u51c6VQA\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0", "conclusion": "\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5f15\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u4e3a\u7f13\u89e3MLLM\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u517c\u5bb9\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5"}}
