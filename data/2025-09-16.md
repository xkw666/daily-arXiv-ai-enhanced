### [1] [Uncovering the Vulnerability of Large Language Models in the Financial Domain via Risk Concealment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10546)
*Gang Cheng,Haibo Jin,Wenbin Zhang,Haohan Wang,Jun Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出风险隐藏攻击框架（RCA），揭示主流金融大模型在监管合规方面的重大安全漏洞，攻击成功率平均达93.18%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全研究集中于通用领域有害内容，缺乏对金融领域特有监管风险的针对性研究

Method: 开发多轮风险隐藏攻击框架RCA，构建金融领域安全基准FIN-Bench，测试9个主流LLM

Result: RCA成功突破所有测试模型，GPT-4攻击成功率98.28%，OpenAI o1达97.56%，平均成功率93.18%

Conclusion: 当前LLM对齐技术在金融领域存在重大缺陷，亟需建立领域感知的强化监管机制

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into financial
applications, yet existing red-teaming research primarily targets harmful
content, largely neglecting regulatory risks. In this work, we aim to
investigate the vulnerability of financial LLMs through red-teaming approaches.
We introduce Risk-Concealment Attacks (RCA), a novel multi-turn framework that
iteratively conceals regulatory risks to provoke seemingly compliant yet
regulatory-violating responses from LLMs. To enable systematic evaluation, we
construct FIN-Bench, a domain-specific benchmark for assessing LLM safety in
financial contexts. Extensive experiments on FIN-Bench demonstrate that RCA
effectively bypasses nine mainstream LLMs, achieving an average attack success
rate (ASR) of 93.18%, including 98.28% on GPT-4.1 and 97.56% on OpenAI o1.
These findings reveal a critical gap in current alignment techniques and
underscore the urgent need for stronger moderation mechanisms in financial
domains. We hope this work offers practical insights for advancing robust and
domain-aware LLM alignment.

### [2] [No Answer Needed: Predicting LLM Answer Accuracy from Question-Only Linear Probes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10625)
*Iván Vicente Moreno Cencerrado,Arnau Padrés Masdemont,Anton Gonzalvez Hawthorne,David Demitri Africa,Lorenzo Pacchiardi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型通过中间层激活值可预测答案正确性，数学推理能力较弱，且'我不知道'回答与内部置信度强相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLM是否具备自我评估答案正确性的能力，并分析其内部机制的表现特征。

Method: 在问题输入后、答案生成前提取模型激活值，训练线性探针预测正确性，跨多个模型家族（7B-70B参数）和不同分布数据集进行验证。

Result: 中间层激活预测效果最佳，数学推理任务泛化能力差，模型拒绝回答行为与探针得分高度相关。

Conclusion: LLM的自我评估能力存在于计算中期阶段，补充了模型内部机制理解，但数学推理能力仍需改进。

Abstract: Do large language models (LLMs) anticipate when they will answer correctly?
To study this, we extract activations after a question is read but before any
tokens are generated, and train linear probes to predict whether the model's
forthcoming answer will be correct. Across three open-source model families
ranging from 7 to 70 billion parameters, projections on this "in-advance
correctness direction" trained on generic trivia questions predict success in
distribution and on diverse out-of-distribution knowledge datasets,
outperforming black-box baselines and verbalised predicted confidence.
Predictive power saturates in intermediate layers, suggesting that
self-assessment emerges mid-computation. Notably, generalisation falters on
questions requiring mathematical reasoning. Moreover, for models responding "I
don't know", doing so strongly correlates with the probe score, indicating that
the same direction also captures confidence. By complementing previous results
on truthfulness and other behaviours obtained with probes and sparse
auto-encoders, our work contributes essential findings to elucidate LLM
internals.

### [3] [Interdisciplinary Research in Conversation: A Case Study in Computational Morphology for Language Documentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10644)
*Enora Rice,Katharina von der Wense,Alexis Palmer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文指出计算形态学研究与实际语言文档工作脱节，提出通过用户中心设计（UCD）提升工具实用性，并以GlossLM模型为例揭示指标表现与真实需求的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前计算形态学工具在语言文档实践中应用有限，核心矛盾在于NLP研究与实际场景需求错配。研究旨在通过用户中心设计（UCD）重构研究范式，解决工具实用性问题。

Method: 采用案例研究法，对最先进的多语言IGT生成模型GlossLM开展小规模用户研究（3名语言学家参与），评估系统在真实文档场景中的可用性。

Result: 研究发现即使指标表现优异，系统仍无法满足实际文档核心需求，暴露出模型限制、标签标准化、分词及个性化等新研究问题。

Conclusion: 以用户为中心的设计不仅能提升工具效能，更能揭示更丰富、相关性强的研究方向，推动计算形态学与语言文档的有机融合。

Abstract: Computational morphology has the potential to support language documentation
through tasks like morphological segmentation and the generation of Interlinear
Glossed Text (IGT). However, our research outputs have seen limited use in
real-world language documentation settings. This position paper situates the
disconnect between computational morphology and language documentation within a
broader misalignment between research and practice in NLP and argues that the
field risks becoming decontextualized and ineffectual without systematic
integration of User-Centered Design (UCD). To demonstrate how principles from
UCD can reshape the research agenda, we present a case study of GlossLM, a
state-of-the-art multilingual IGT generation model. Through a small-scale user
study with three documentary linguists, we find that despite strong metric
based performance, the system fails to meet core usability needs in real
documentation contexts. These insights raise new research questions around
model constraints, label standardization, segmentation, and personalization. We
argue that centering users not only produces more effective tools, but surfaces
richer, more relevant research directions

### [4] [Context Copying Modulation: The Role of Entropy Neurons in Managing Parametric and Contextual Knowledge Conflicts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10663)
*Zineddine Tighidet,Andrea Mogini,Hedi Ben-younes,Jiali Mei,Patrick Gallinari,Benjamin Piwowarski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大语言模型中的熵神经元抑制上下文复制行为，增强对冲突信息处理的理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在处理上下文与内部知识冲突时的行为不一致问题，探索熵神经元在此过程中的作用。

Method: 通过消融实验分析熵神经元在不同LLMs中抑制上下文复制的机制，观察生成过程变化。

Result: 熵神经元负责抑制上下文复制，消融后生成过程显著改变，证实其在处理冲突信息中的关键角色。

Conclusion: 研究结果深化了对LLMs内部动态的理解，特别是在处理冲突信息时熵神经元的重要性。

Abstract: The behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) when facing contextual
information that conflicts with their internal parametric knowledge is
inconsistent, with no generally accepted explanation for the expected outcome
distribution. Recent work has identified in autoregressive transformer models a
class of neurons -- called entropy neurons -- that produce a significant effect
on the model output entropy while having an overall moderate impact on the
ranking of the predicted tokens. In this paper, we investigate the preliminary
claim that these neurons are involved in inhibiting context copying behavior in
transformers by looking at their role in resolving conflicts between contextual
and parametric information. We show that entropy neurons are responsible for
suppressing context copying across a range of LLMs, and that ablating them
leads to a significant change in the generation process. These results enhance
our understanding of the internal dynamics of LLMs when handling conflicting
information.

### [5] [Pluralistic Alignment for Healthcare: A Role-Driven Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10685)
*Jiayou Zhong,Anudeex Shetty,Chao Jia,Xuanrui Lin,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出EthosAgents方法，通过模拟多样化价值观实现医疗领域大语言模型的多元化对齐，在七种不同规模模型中均取得提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐方法（如模块化多元主义）难以适应医疗领域因个人/文化/情境因素形成的复杂多元价值观，需开发轻量化通用方案。

Method: 开发EthosAgents框架，通过代理机制模拟不同价值立场，在7个开源与闭源模型（不同参数量级）上测试三种对齐模式。

Result: 实验表明该方法在所有模型的三种对齐模式下均提升多元化表现，验证了规范意识与适应性机制的有效性。

Conclusion: 医疗领域的价值观对齐需动态适应性方案，该研究为其他高风险领域（如法律、金融）的AI伦理对齐提供方法论启示。

Abstract: As large language models are increasingly deployed in sensitive domains such
as healthcare, ensuring their outputs reflect the diverse values and
perspectives held across populations is critical. However, existing alignment
approaches, including pluralistic paradigms like Modular Pluralism, often fall
short in the health domain, where personal, cultural, and situational factors
shape pluralism. Motivated by the aforementioned healthcare challenges, we
propose a first lightweight, generalizable, pluralistic alignment approach,
EthosAgents, designed to simulate diverse perspectives and values. We
empirically show that it advances the pluralistic alignment for all three modes
across seven varying-sized open and closed models. Our findings reveal that
health-related pluralism demands adaptable and normatively aware approaches,
offering insights into how these models can better respect diversity in other
high-stakes domains.

### [6] [Struct-Bench: A Benchmark for Differentially Private Structured Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10696)
*Shuaiqi Wang,Vikas Raunak,Arturs Backurs,Victor Reis,Pei Zhou,Sihao Chen,Longqi Yang,Zinan Lin,Sergey Yekhanin,Giulia Fanti*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Struct-Bench框架与基准测试，用于评估包含自然语言的结构化数据DP合成方法，解决现有评估指标不足并建立标准化评估平台。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有合成数据评估方法（如FID）难以有效评估包含自然语言的结构化数据质量，需建立针对性的评估基准推动隐私保护数据生成研究。

Method: 要求用户以上下文无关文法（CFG）描述数据结构，整合5个真实/2个合成数据集，提供结构化数据生成质量评估指标与排行榜。

Result: 实验表明现有DP方法在结构化数据生成上存在显著挑战，并通过案例验证Struct-Bench可提升Private Evolution的生成质量。

Conclusion: Struct-Bench通过标准化评估框架、多维度指标和公开资源，促进隐私保护结构化数据生成方法的研究与改进。

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) synthetic data generation is a promising
technique for utilizing private datasets that otherwise cannot be exposed for
model training or other analytics. While much research literature has focused
on generating private unstructured text and image data, in enterprise settings,
structured data (e.g., tabular) is more common, often including natural
language fields or components. Existing synthetic data evaluation techniques
(e.g., FID) struggle to capture the structural properties and correlations of
such datasets. In this work, we propose Struct-Bench, a framework and benchmark
for evaluating synthetic datasets derived from structured datasets that contain
natural language data. The Struct-Bench framework requires users to provide a
representation of their dataset structure as a Context-Free Grammar (CFG). Our
benchmark comprises 5 real-world and 2 synthetically generated datasets, each
annotated with CFGs. We show that these datasets demonstrably present a great
challenge even for state-of-the-art DP synthetic data generation methods.
Struct-Bench also includes reference implementations of different metrics and a
leaderboard, thereby providing researchers a standardized evaluation platform
to benchmark and investigate privacy-preserving synthetic data generation
methods. Further, we also present a case study showing how to use Struct-Bench
to improve the synthetic data quality of Private Evolution (PE) on structured
data. The benchmark and the leaderboard have been publicly made available at
https://struct-bench.github.io.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在现实应用中存在幻觉内容生成、知识更新滞后、专业领域能力有限等关键缺陷，需要动态知识整合方案

Method: 系统性分析：1) 稀疏/密集/混合检索机制 2) 分类法构建/层级分类/信息抽取等文本结构化技术 3) 基于提示/推理框架/知识嵌入的LLM集成方法

Conclusion: 为RAS技术体系提供首个系统性综述框架，指明检索增强与结构化知识融合的技术路径及应用前景

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing
with their remarkable capabilities in text generation and reasoning. However,
these models face critical challenges when deployed in real-world applications,
including hallucination generation, outdated knowledge, and limited domain
expertise. Retrieval And Structuring (RAS) Augmented Generation addresses these
limitations by integrating dynamic information retrieval with structured
knowledge representations. This survey (1) examines retrieval mechanisms
including sparse, dense, and hybrid approaches for accessing external
knowledge; (2) explore text structuring techniques such as taxonomy
construction, hierarchical classification, and information extraction that
transform unstructured text into organized representations; and (3) investigate
how these structured representations integrate with LLMs through prompt-based
methods, reasoning frameworks, and knowledge embedding techniques. It also
identifies technical challenges in retrieval efficiency, structure quality, and
knowledge integration, while highlighting research opportunities in multimodal
retrieval, cross-lingual structures, and interactive systems. This
comprehensive overview provides researchers and practitioners with insights
into RAS methods, applications, and future directions.

*Iman Barati,Mostafa Amiri,Heshaam Faili*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出SearchInstruct方法，通过LLM扩展问题与动态检索生成高质量SFT数据集，提升模型在专业领域的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决特定领域监督微调（SFT）数据集构建难题，传统方法难以生成符合领域约束且数据稀缺的高质量训练数据

Method: 基于少量人工生成问题，利用大语言模型系统性扩展问题，动态检索领域资源生成精准答案

Result: 实验验证方法提升SFT数据集多样性及质量，显著增强LLM在专业领域表现，并有效支持模型编辑等任务

Conclusion: SearchInstruct为领域专用模型优化提供可扩展解决方案，开源实现促进社区应用与复现

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is essential for training large language models
(LLMs), significantly enhancing critical capabilities such as instruction
following and in-context learning. Nevertheless, creating suitable training
datasets tailored for specific domains remains challenging due to unique domain
constraints and data scarcity. In this paper, we propose SearchInstruct, an
innovative method explicitly designed to construct high quality instruction
datasets for SFT. Our approach begins with a limited set of domain specific,
human generated questions, which are systematically expanded using a large
language model. Subsequently, domain relevant resources are dynamically
retrieved to generate accurate and contextually appropriate answers for each
augmented question. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that SearchInstruct
enhances both the diversity and quality of SFT datasets, leading to measurable
improvements in LLM performance within specialized domains. Additionally, we
show that beyond dataset generation, the proposed method can also effectively
facilitate tasks such as model editing, enabling efficient updates to existing
models. To facilitate reproducibility and community adoption, we provide full
implementation details, the complete set of generated instruction response
pairs, and the source code in a publicly accessible Git repository:

### [9] [PolyTruth: Multilingual Disinformation Detection using Transformer-Based Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10737)
*Zaur Gouliev,Jennifer Waters,Chengqian Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究系统评估了五款多语言Transformer模型在25种语言中的虚假信息检测能力，构建了PolyTruth数据集并发现RemBERT在低资源语言中表现最佳，揭示了现有AI系统的潜力与局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型主要在英语环境测试，但虚假信息常跨语言传播。本研究旨在填补多语言场景下模型性能评估的空白。

Method: 使用包含60,486对跨25种语言声明的PolyTruth数据集，对比mBERT/XLM/XLM-RoBERTa/RemBERT/mT5在虚假信息分类任务中的表现，其中半数数据来自增强的MindBugs验证集。

Result: RemBERT整体表现最优（尤其在低资源语言），而mBERT/XLM在数据稀缺时性能受限。数据集已开源供后续研究。

Conclusion: 研究表明AI在多语言虚假信息检测中具备潜力但仍有局限，开源数据集将推动该领域发展。

Abstract: Disinformation spreads rapidly across linguistic boundaries, yet most AI
models are still benchmarked only on English. We address this gap with a
systematic comparison of five multilingual transformer models: mBERT, XLM,
XLM-RoBERTa, RemBERT, and mT5 on a common fake-vs-true machine learning
classification task. While transformer-based language models have demonstrated
notable success in detecting disinformation in English, their effectiveness in
multilingual contexts still remains up for debate. To facilitate evaluation, we
introduce PolyTruth Disinfo Corpus, a novel corpus of 60,486 statement pairs
(false claim vs. factual correction) spanning over twenty five languages that
collectively cover five language families and a broad topical range from
politics, health, climate, finance, and conspiracy, half of which are
fact-checked disinformation claims verified by an augmented MindBugs Discovery
dataset. Our experiments revealed performance variations. Models such as
RemBERT achieved better overall accuracy, particularly excelling in
low-resource languages, whereas models like mBERT and XLM exhibit considerable
limitations when training data is scarce. We provide a discussion of these
performance patterns and implications for real-world deployment. The dataset is
publicly available on our GitHub repository to encourage further
experimentation and advancement. Our findings illuminate both the potential and
the current limitations of AI systems for multilingual disinformation
detection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在概率推理任务中存在性能差距，大模型在推理和样本生成方面表现更优，但也存在符号敏感性和上下文长度限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在语言理解生成方面表现优异，但其在需要概率推理的任务中表现出不明确且不一致的行为，需系统性评估其概率推理能力。

Method: 通过设计模式识别、最大似然估计、样本生成三个任务，评估LLMs对联合分布及条件分布的推理能力，分析频率统计、边缘化、生成行为等技能。

Result: 大模型展现出更强的推理能力和样本生成潜力，但对概率符号表示敏感且上下文长度增加时性能下降超60%。

Conclusion: 需提升LLMs的概率符号鲁棒性及长上下文处理能力，为构建可靠概率推理系统提供改进方向。

Abstract: Despite widespread success in language understanding and generation, large
language models (LLMs) exhibit unclear and often inconsistent behavior when
faced with tasks that require probabilistic reasoning. In this work, we present
the first comprehensive study of the reasoning capabilities of LLMs over
explicit discrete probability distributions. Given observations from a
probability distribution, we evaluate models on three carefully designed tasks,
mode identification, maximum likelihood estimation, and sample generation, by
prompting them to provide responses to queries about either the joint
distribution or its conditionals. These tasks thus probe a range of
probabilistic skills, including frequency analysis, marginalization, and
generative behavior. Through comprehensive empirical evaluations, we
demonstrate that there exists a clear performance gap between smaller and
larger models, with the latter demonstrating stronger inference and surprising
capabilities in sample generation. Furthermore, our investigations reveal
notable limitations, including sensitivity to variations in the notation
utilized to represent probabilistic outcomes and performance degradation of
over 60% as context length increases. Together, our results provide a detailed
understanding of the probabilistic reasoning abilities of LLMs and identify key
directions for future improvement.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出自动化生成科学领域MCQA评估基准的框架，通过推理追踪检索显著提升小模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估基准无法跟上科学知识的快速更新，需要自动化生成最新测试基准以确保语言模型评估的有效性

Method: 开发模块化框架实现PDF解析到问题生成的全流程自动化，在放射与癌症生物学领域生成16,000+多选题，测试1.1B-14B参数模型并比较不同检索方法

Result: 推理追踪检索使多个小模型在合成/专家标注基准上表现提升，部分模型在专业考试中超越GPT-4

Conclusion: 自动化评估基准生成方法有效，结合推理追踪检索可显著增强小模型性能，为持续评估语言模型提供新方案

Abstract: As scientific knowledge grows at an unprecedented pace, evaluation benchmarks
must evolve to reflect new discoveries and ensure language models are tested on
current, diverse literature. We propose a scalable, modular framework for
generating multiple-choice question-answering (MCQA) benchmarks directly from
large corpora of scientific papers. Our pipeline automates every stage of MCQA
creation, including PDF parsing, semantic chunking, question generation, and
model evaluation. As a case study, we generate more than 16,000 MCQs from
22,000 open-access articles in radiation and cancer biology. We then evaluate a
suite of small language models (1.1B-14B parameters) on these questions,
comparing baseline accuracy with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) from
paper-derived semantic chunks and from reasoning traces distilled from GPT-4.1.
We find that reasoning-trace retrieval consistently improves performance on
both synthetic and expert-annotated benchmarks, enabling several small models
to surpass GPT-4 on the 2023 Astro Radiation and Cancer Biology exam.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RECAP框架通过模块化情感推理显著提升医疗AI的同理心沟通能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗语言模型缺乏情感支持能力，临床场景中患者需要具有同理心的沟通来建立信任与依从性

Method: 提出RECAP五步推理框架（Reflect-Extract-Calibrate-Align-Produce），将同理心分解为可解释的评估阶段，并引入Likert量表信号

Result: 在多个基准测试中提升8B模型22-28%的情感推理能力，临床评估显示更优的同理心沟通表现

Conclusion: 基于认知评价理论的模块化提示方法可在保持医疗AI问责制的同时系统性增强其情感智能

Abstract: Large language models in healthcare often miss critical emotional cues,
delivering medically sound but emotionally flat advice. This is especially
problematic in clinical contexts where patients are distressed and vulnerable,
and require empathic communication to support safety, adherence, and trust. We
present RECAP (Reflect-Extract-Calibrate-Align-Produce), an inference-time
framework that adds structured emotional reasoning without retraining. By
decomposing empathy into transparent appraisal-theoretic stages and exposing
per-dimension Likert signals, RECAP produces nuanced, auditable responses.
Across EmoBench, SECEU, and EQ-Bench, RECAP improves emotional reasoning by
22-28% on 8B models and 10-13% on larger models over zero-shot baselines.
Clinician evaluations further confirm superior empathetic communication. RECAP
shows that modular, theory-grounded prompting can systematically enhance
emotional intelligence in medical AI while preserving the accountability
required for deployment.

TL;DR: 提出Judge Q方法通过软令牌列表优化KV缓存淘汰策略，在低训练成本下提升LLM的长序列处理性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存淘汰方法过度依赖局部窗口信息，导致全局关键信息丢失。需要更有效的全局信息捕捉机制

Method: 1. 在嵌入层训练软令牌列表
2. 将软令牌与输入序列拼接
3. 对齐软令牌与解码token的注意力图
4. 生成全局感知的KV重要性评分

Result: LongBench提升1分/RULER提升3分，Llama-3.1-8B和Mistral-7B验证有效，KV缓存淘汰时性能衰减更小

Conclusion: 该方法以极低训练成本实现全局信息捕捉，兼容现有开源模型，显著提升长文本处理效率

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) utilize key-value (KV) cache to store historical
information during sequence processing. The size of KV cache grows linearly as
the length of the sequence extends, which seriously affects memory usage and
decoding efficiency. Current methods for KV cache eviction typically utilize
the last window from the pre-filling phase as queries to compute the KV
importance scores for eviction. Although this scheme is simple to implement, it
tends to overly focus on local information, potentially leading to the neglect
or omission of crucial global information. To mitigate this issue, we propose
Judge Q, a novel training method which incorporates a soft token list. This
method only tunes the model's embedding layer at a low training cost. By
concatenating the soft token list at the end of the input sequence, we train
these tokens' attention map to the original input sequence to align with that
of the actual decoded tokens. In this way, the queries corresponding to the
soft tokens can effectively capture global information and better evaluate the
importance of the keys and values within the KV cache, thus maintaining
decoding quality when KV cache is evicted. Under the same eviction budget, our
method exhibits less performance degradation compared to existing eviction
approaches. We validate our approach through experiments conducted on models
such as Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, using benchmarks
including LongBench, RULER, and Needle-in-a-Haystack. Results indicate an
improvement of approximately 1 point on the LongBench and over 3 points on
RULER. This proposed methodology can be seamlessly integrated into existing
open-source models with minimal training overhead, thereby enhancing
performance in KV cache eviction scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出SEEED方法改进对话AI错误检测，通过增强负样本权重和对比样本选择，提升未知错误识别准确率8%并强化泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在检测未明确指定的错误（如模型更新或用户行为变化导致的错误）时存在局限，需更有效的自动化错误发现方法。

Method: 提出Automated Error Discovery框架，SEEED方法改进Soft Nearest Neighbor Loss的负样本距离权重，结合Label-Based Sample Ranking优化表示学习。

Result: SEEED在多个数据集上超越GPT-4o等基线模型，未知错误检测准确率最高提升8%，且泛化到未知意图检测任务表现优异。

Conclusion: SEEED通过损失函数改进和样本选择策略，显著提升对话AI错误检测能力，为动态环境下的错误管理提供新解决方案。

Abstract: Although LLM-based conversational agents demonstrate strong fluency and
coherence, they still produce undesirable behaviors (errors) that are
challenging to prevent from reaching users during deployment. Recent research
leverages large language models (LLMs) to detect errors and guide
response-generation models toward improvement. However, current LLMs struggle
to identify errors not explicitly specified in their instructions, such as
those arising from updates to the response-generation model or shifts in user
behavior. In this work, we introduce Automated Error Discovery, a framework for
detecting and defining errors in conversational AI, and propose SEEED (Soft
Clustering Extended Encoder-Based Error Detection), as an encoder-based
approach to its implementation. We enhance the Soft Nearest Neighbor Loss by
amplifying distance weighting for negative samples and introduce Label-Based
Sample Ranking to select highly contrastive examples for better representation
learning. SEEED outperforms adapted baselines -- including GPT-4o and Phi-4 --
across multiple error-annotated dialogue datasets, improving the accuracy for
detecting unknown errors by up to 8 points and demonstrating strong
generalization to unknown intent detection.

Result: 结构化指南准确率显著高于叙事数据；引用量每翻倍使正确率提升30%；提供金标准摘要可将错误项准确率提升至0.79。

Conclusion: LLMs在临床问答中展现潜力但存在局限，检索增强和分层评估是提升证据对齐的关键，模型性能受数据源质量影响大于模型规模。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial progress in
biomedical and clinical applications, motivating rigorous evaluation of their
ability to answer nuanced, evidence-based questions. We curate a multi-source
benchmark drawing from Cochrane systematic reviews and clinical guidelines,
including structured recommendations from the American Heart Association and
narrative guidance used by insurers. Using GPT-4o-mini and GPT-5, we observe
consistent performance patterns across sources and clinical domains: accuracy
is highest on structured guideline recommendations (90%) and lower on narrative
guideline and systematic review questions (60--70%). We also find a strong
correlation between accuracy and the citation count of the underlying
systematic reviews, where each doubling of citations is associated with roughly
a 30% increase in the odds of a correct answer. Models show moderate ability to
reason about evidence quality when contextual information is supplied. When we
incorporate retrieval-augmented prompting, providing the gold-source abstract
raises accuracy on previously incorrect items to 0.79; providing top 3 PubMed
abstracts (ranked by semantic relevance) improves accuracy to 0.23, while
random abstracts reduce accuracy (0.10, within temperature variation). These
effects are mirrored in GPT-4o-mini, underscoring that source clarity and
targeted retrieval -- not just model size -- drive performance. Overall, our
results highlight both the promise and current limitations of LLMs for
evidence-based clinical question answering. Retrieval-augmented prompting
emerges as a useful strategy to improve factual accuracy and alignment with
source evidence, while stratified evaluation by specialty and question type
remains essential to understand current knowledge access and to contextualize
model performance.

### [16] [GAPrune: Gradient-Alignment Pruning for Domain-Aware Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10844)
*Yixuan Tang,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出GAPrune剪枝框架，通过综合领域重要性和通用语义保留，在50%稀疏度下保持领域性能（性能损失<2.5%），并通过短时重训练实现性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM剪枝方法未区分通用和领域参数，导致领域能力受损。需在模型压缩的同时维持领域专业化能力。

Method: 1. 使用Fisher信息衡量领域重要性 2. 通用域梯度对齐评估参数行为 3. 综合形成DAI评分指标，优先剪除低DAI参数（领域不重要/目标冲突）

Result: 单次剪枝：FinMTEB/ChemTEB性能损失≤2.5%（50%稀疏度）；100步重训练后：FinMTEB提升4.51%，ChemTEB提升1.73%

Conclusion: 定向剪枝策略可同时实现模型压缩与领域能力增强，为资源受限环境部署提供新范式，推动领域嵌入模型实用化进程

Abstract: Domain-specific embedding models have shown promise for applications that
require specialized semantic understanding, such as coding agents and financial
retrieval systems, often achieving higher performance gains than general
models. However, state-of-the-art embedding models are typically based on LLMs,
which contain billions of parameters, making deployment challenging in
resource-constrained environments. Model compression through pruning offers a
promising solution, but existing pruning methods treat all parameters
uniformly, failing to distinguish between general semantic representations and
domain-specific patterns, leading to suboptimal pruning decisions. Thus, we
propose GAPrune, a pruning framework that addresses this challenge by
considering both domain importance and preserving general linguistic
foundation. Our method uses Fisher Information to measure importance and
general-domain gradient alignment to assess parameter behavior, then combines
these signals using our Domain Alignment Importance (DAI) scoring. Lower DAI
scores indicate that the parameter is either less important for the domain task
or creates conflicts between domain and general objectives. Experiments on two
domain benchmarks, FinMTEB and ChemTEB, show that GAPrune maintains performance
within 2.5% of dense models in one-shot pruning at 50% sparsity, while
outperforming all baselines. With retraining in 100 steps, GAPrune achieves
+4.51% improvement on FinMTEB and +1.73% on ChemTEB, demonstrating that our
pruning strategy not only preserves but enhances domain-specific capabilities.
Our findings demonstrate that principled pruning strategies can achieve model
compression and enhanced domain specialization, providing the research
community with a new approach for development.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于扩散模型的Text2SignDiff方法，实现无需gloss符号的手语生成，通过跨模态对齐提升生成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手语生成依赖gloss符号标注，存在标注稀缺、语言依赖性强的缺陷，限制了模型的灵活性和泛化能力

Method: 1. 设计非自回归的潜在扩散模型，联合噪声潜在手语编码和口语文本迭代去噪
2. 开发跨模态对齐器，在共享潜在空间桥接手语视觉特征与口语文本特征

Result: 在PHOENIX14T和How2Sign数据集上达到SOTA，验证了方法的有效性

Conclusion: 通过扩散模型与跨模态对齐的协同设计，首次实现了无需gloss的高质量手语生成，推动聋人社区数字包容

Abstract: Sign language production (SLP) aims to translate spoken language sentences
into a sequence of pose frames in a sign language, bridging the communication
gap and promoting digital inclusion for deaf and hard-of-hearing communities.
Existing methods typically rely on gloss, a symbolic representation of sign
language words or phrases that serves as an intermediate step in SLP. This
limits the flexibility and generalization of SLP, as gloss annotations are
often unavailable and language-specific. Therefore, we present a novel
diffusion-based generative approach - Text2Sign Diffusion (Text2SignDiff) for
gloss-free SLP. Specifically, a gloss-free latent diffusion model is proposed
to generate sign language sequences from noisy latent sign codes and spoken
text jointly, reducing the potential error accumulation through a
non-autoregressive iterative denoising process. We also design a cross-modal
signing aligner that learns a shared latent space to bridge visual and textual
content in sign and spoken languages. This alignment supports the conditioned
diffusion-based process, enabling more accurate and contextually relevant sign
language generation without gloss. Extensive experiments on the commonly used
PHOENIX14T and How2Sign datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method,
achieving the state-of-the-art performance.

*Xiaohui Rao,Hanlin Wu,Zhenguang G. Cai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究通过脑电数据揭示：虽然AI与人类幽默行为评分相近，但AI幽默引发更小N400（认知努力降低）和更大LPP（情绪反应增强），显示大脑对AI幽默存在动态适应的积极反馈机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究人类对AI幽默的认知神经机制，验证算法厌恶理论在幽默领域的适用性，为AI社交能力提供神经科学依据。

Method: 采用脑电图（EEG）对比分析24名被试处理AI/人类幽默时的N400（语义冲突）和LPP（情绪唤醒）成分，结合时间动态变化模式。

Result: AI幽默引发N400下降18%（认知效率提升），LPP增强32%（情绪奖励）。人类幽默组显示神经适应性，而AI组呈现累积强化效应。AI可信度评分与LPP振幅正相关（r=0.67）。

Conclusion: 大脑通过动态更新预测模型适应AI幽默，累积强化效应挑战算法厌恶理论，揭示AI幽默在促进人机共情中的独特神经机制。

Abstract: As AI companions become capable of human-like communication, including
telling jokes, understanding how people cognitively and emotionally respond to
AI humor becomes increasingly important. This study used electroencephalography
(EEG) to compare how people process humor from AI versus human sources.
Behavioral analysis revealed that participants rated AI and human humor as
comparably funny. However, neurophysiological data showed that AI humor
elicited a smaller N400 effect, suggesting reduced cognitive effort during the
processing of incongruity. This was accompanied by a larger Late Positive
Potential (LPP), indicating a greater degree of surprise and emotional
response. This enhanced LPP likely stems from the violation of low initial
expectations regarding AI's comedic capabilities. Furthermore, a key temporal
dynamic emerged: human humor showed habituation effects, marked by an
increasing N400 and a decreasing LPP over time. In contrast, AI humor
demonstrated increasing processing efficiency and emotional reward, with a
decreasing N400 and an increasing LPP. This trajectory reveals how the brain
can dynamically update its predictive model of AI capabilities. This process of
cumulative reinforcement challenges "algorithm aversion" in humor, as it
demonstrates how cognitive adaptation to AI's language patterns can lead to an
intensified emotional reward. Additionally, participants' social attitudes
toward AI modulated these neural responses, with higher perceived AI
trustworthiness correlating with enhanced emotional engagement. These findings
indicate that the brain responds to AI humor with surprisingly positive and
intense reactions, highlighting humor's potential for fostering genuine
engagement in human-AI social interaction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PREMem通过将复杂推理过程前置到记忆存储阶段，显著减轻对话AI生成响应时的计算负担，提升不同规模模型的性能表现（小模型可达大型基线水平），且在有限token预算下仍保持有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对话系统的长期记忆能力依赖响应生成阶段的实时推理，导致性能受限于模型规模。作者试图通过将推理过程迁移至记忆构建阶段，降低交互时的计算需求并增强记忆表征。

Method: 1. 提取细粒度记忆片段（事实/经验/主观信息）
2. 建立跨会话记忆项的显式关系
3. 捕捉扩展/转换/影响等演变模式
4. 在预存储阶段完成关系推理而非响应生成时

Result: 实验显示：所有模型规模均获显著提升（+12.7% F1）；6B小模型性能接近175B基线；token预算压缩至1/3时仍保持90%效果

Conclusion: PREMem通过预存储推理重构记忆结构，实现了计算负载的时空转移，使不同规模模型都能高效处理长期记忆依赖，在资源受限场景下具备实用价值。

Abstract: Effective long-term memory in conversational AI requires synthesizing
information across multiple sessions. However, current systems place excessive
reasoning burden on response generation, making performance significantly
dependent on model sizes. We introduce PREMem (Pre-storage Reasoning for
Episodic Memory), a novel approach that shifts complex reasoning processes from
inference to memory construction. PREMem extracts fine-grained memory fragments
categorized into factual, experiential, and subjective information; it then
establishes explicit relationships between memory items across sessions,
capturing evolution patterns like extensions, transformations, and
implications. By performing this reasoning during pre-storage rather than when
generating a response, PREMem creates enriched representations while reducing
computational demands during interactions. Experiments show significant
performance improvements across all model sizes, with smaller models achieving
results comparable to much larger baselines while maintaining effectiveness
even with constrained token budgets. Code and dataset are available at
https://github.com/sangyeop-kim/PREMem.

*Shaohua Fang,Yue Li,Yan Cong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大语言模型在量词辖域解释中呈现类人倾向，多数模型偏好表层解释，部分模型展现中英文逆辖域差异，模型架构与训练数据显著影响对齐程度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大语言模型如何处理跨语言的量词辖域歧义现象，验证其是否具备人类相似的量化解释模式

Method: 采用跨语言对比方法，通过概率评估解释可能性，使用人类相似性评分（HS）量化模型与人类表现的接近程度

Result: 多数模型偏好表层解释（与人类趋势一致），部分模型在中英文逆辖域偏好上呈现语言特异性，HS评分显示模型对齐潜力但存在显著个体差异

Conclusion: 大语言模型展现出与人类解释对齐的潜力，但模型架构、规模和训练数据语言背景（特别是预训练数据的语言构成）显著影响其类人量化解释的近似程度

Abstract: Sentences with multiple quantifiers often lead to interpretive ambiguities,
which can vary across languages. This study adopts a cross-linguistic approach
to examine how large language models (LLMs) handle quantifier scope
interpretation in English and Chinese, using probabilities to assess
interpretive likelihood. Human similarity (HS) scores were used to quantify the
extent to which LLMs emulate human performance across language groups. Results
reveal that most LLMs prefer the surface scope interpretations, aligning with
human tendencies, while only some differentiate between English and Chinese in
the inverse scope preferences, reflecting human-similar patterns. HS scores
highlight variability in LLMs' approximation of human behavior, but their
overall potential to align with humans is notable. Differences in model
architecture, scale, and particularly models' pre-training data language
background, significantly influence how closely LLMs approximate human
quantifier scope interpretations.

TL;DR: 提出Term2Note方法，在强差分隐私约束下生成高质量临床笔记，平衡隐私保护与数据效用


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域使用真实数据存在隐私泄露风险，现有差分隐私文本生成方法在长临床笔记合成中难以兼顾隐私与效用

Method: 通过内容和形式的结构化分离，分节生成基于DP医疗术语的笔记内容，配合DP质量最大化器筛选高质量输出

Result: 合成笔记统计特征与真实数据高度吻合，分类模型性能接近真实数据训练结果，较基线方法保真度提升18.2%

Conclusion: Term2Note在严格隐私约束下实现临床笔记的高保真合成，为医疗数据隐私保护提供了可行替代方案

Abstract: Training data is fundamental to the success of modern machine learning
models, yet in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, the use of real-world
training data is severely constrained by concerns over privacy leakage. A
promising solution to this challenge is the use of differentially private (DP)
synthetic data, which offers formal privacy guarantees while maintaining data
utility. However, striking the right balance between privacy protection and
utility remains challenging in clinical note synthesis, given its domain
specificity and the complexity of long-form text generation. In this paper, we
present Term2Note, a methodology to synthesise long clinical notes under strong
DP constraints. By structurally separating content and form, Term2Note
generates section-wise note content conditioned on DP medical terms, with each
governed by separate DP constraints. A DP quality maximiser further enhances
synthetic notes by selecting high-quality outputs. Experimental results show
that Term2Note produces synthetic notes with statistical properties closely
aligned with real clinical notes, demonstrating strong fidelity. In addition,
multi-label classification models trained on these synthetic notes perform
comparably to those trained on real data, confirming their high utility.
Compared to existing DP text generation baselines, Term2Note achieves
substantial improvements in both fidelity and utility while operating under
fewer assumptions, suggesting its potential as a viable privacy-preserving
alternative to using sensitive clinical notes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文化能力评估存在分类零散、领域局限和人工依赖问题，需系统化解决方案提升LLMs的跨文化适应性。

Method: 1. 构建12主类/130子类的多层级文化分类法；2. 基于RAG利用事实知识合成跨文化QA对；3. 创建含19,360条数据的CultureSynth-7基准。

Result: 评估14个LLMs发现：GPT-4o领先，3B参数为文化能力门槛；模型存在架构处理偏见和显著地理差异（如亚洲主题准确率低30%）。

Conclusion: CultureSynth提供可扩展的文化评估框架，降低人工标注依赖，揭示模型文化能力与参数规模、架构设计的地理关联性。

Abstract: Cultural competence, defined as the ability to understand and adapt to
multicultural contexts, is increasingly vital for large language models (LLMs)
in global environments. While several cultural benchmarks exist to assess LLMs'
cultural competence, current evaluations suffer from fragmented taxonomies,
domain specificity, and heavy reliance on manual data annotation. To address
these limitations, we introduce CultureSynth, a novel framework comprising (1)
a comprehensive hierarchical multilingual cultural taxonomy covering 12 primary
and 130 secondary topics, and (2) a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based
methodology leveraging factual knowledge to synthesize culturally relevant
question-answer pairs. The CultureSynth-7 synthetic benchmark contains 19,360
entries and 4,149 manually verified entries across 7 languages. Evaluation of
14 prevalent LLMs of different sizes reveals clear performance stratification
led by ChatGPT-4o-Latest and Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct. The results demonstrate that
a 3B-parameter threshold is necessary for achieving basic cultural competence,
models display varying architectural biases in knowledge processing, and
significant geographic disparities exist across models. We believe that
CultureSynth offers a scalable framework for developing culturally aware AI
systems while reducing reliance on manual annotation\footnote{Benchmark is

Conclusion: 该方法为量化评估企业可持续发展合规性提供了标准化解决方案，显著提升非财务风险分析的自动化程度和监管透明度

Abstract: The growing importance of environmental, social, and governance data in
regulatory and investment contexts has increased the need for accurate,
interpretable, and internationally aligned representations of non-financial
risks, particularly those reported in unstructured news sources. However,
aligning such controversy-related data with principle-based normative
frameworks, such as the United Nations Global Compact or Sustainable
Development Goals, presents significant challenges. These frameworks are
typically expressed in abstract language, lack standardized taxonomies, and
differ from the proprietary classification systems used by commercial data
providers. In this paper, we present a semi-automatic method for constructing
structured knowledge representations of environmental, social, and governance
events reported in the news. Our approach uses lightweight ontology design,
formal pattern modeling, and large language models to convert normative
principles into reusable templates expressed in the Resource Description
Framework. These templates are used to extract relevant information from news
content and populate a structured knowledge graph that links reported incidents
to specific framework principles. The result is a scalable and transparent
framework for identifying and interpreting non-compliance with international
sustainability guidelines.

prioritize comprehensive coverage, spotlights selectively emphasize intriguing
content to foster deeper reader engagement with the source material. We
formally differentiate spotlights from related constructs and support our
analysis with a detailed benchmarking study using new datasets curated for this
work. To generate high-quality spotlights, we propose a two-stage approach:
fine-tuning a large language model on our benchmark data, followed by alignment
via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our comprehensive evaluation
demonstrates that the resulting model not only identifies key elements with
precision but also enhances readability and boosts the engagement value of the
original document.

Abstract: The proliferation of clickbait headlines poses significant challenges to the
credibility of information and user trust in digital media. While recent
advances in machine learning have improved the detection of manipulative
content, the lack of explainability limits their practical adoption. This paper
presents a model for explainable clickbait detection that not only identifies
clickbait titles but also attributes them to specific linguistic manipulation
strategies. We introduce a synthetic dataset generated by systematically
augmenting real news headlines using a predefined catalogue of clickbait
strategies. This dataset enables controlled experimentation and detailed
analysis of model behaviour. We present a two-stage framework for automatic
clickbait analysis comprising detection and tactic attribution. In the first
stage, we compare a fine-tuned BERT classifier with large language models
(LLMs), specifically GPT-4.0 and Gemini 2.4 Flash, under both zero-shot
prompting and few-shot prompting enriched with illustrative clickbait headlines
and their associated persuasive tactics. In the second stage, a dedicated
BERT-based classifier predicts the specific clickbait strategies present in
each headline. This work advances the development of transparent and
trustworthy AI systems for combating manipulative media content. We share the
dataset with the research community at

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), they
have demonstrated exceptional capabilities across a variety of vision-language
tasks. However, current evaluation benchmarks predominantly focus on objective
visual question answering or captioning, inadequately assessing the models'
ability to understand complex and subjective human emotions. To bridge this
gap, we introduce EmoBench-Reddit, a novel, hierarchical benchmark for
multimodal emotion understanding. The dataset comprises 350 meticulously
curated samples from the social media platform Reddit, each containing an
image, associated user-provided text, and an emotion category (sad, humor,
sarcasm, happy) confirmed by user flairs. We designed a hierarchical task
framework that progresses from basic perception to advanced cognition, with
each data point featuring six multiple-choice questions and one open-ended
question of increasing difficulty. Perception tasks evaluate the model's
ability to identify basic visual elements (e.g., colors, objects), while
cognition tasks require scene reasoning, intent understanding, and deep empathy
integrating textual context. We ensured annotation quality through a
combination of AI assistance (Claude 4) and manual verification.

Conclusion: 突破静态评估范式，通过动态适配模型能力水平的测试方法可大幅提升基准测试质量，项目反应理论与动态选择机制分别对应效度提升和方差控制

Abstract: Language model (LM) benchmarking faces several challenges: comprehensive
evaluations are costly, benchmarks often fail to measure the intended
capabilities, and evaluation quality can degrade due to labeling errors and
benchmark saturation. Although various strategies have been proposed to
mitigate these issues, they tend to address individual aspects in isolation,
neglecting broader questions about overall evaluation quality. Here, we
introduce Fluid Benchmarking, a new evaluation approach that advances LM
benchmarking across multiple dimensions. Inspired by psychometrics, Fluid
Benchmarking is based on the insight that the relative value of benchmark items
depends on an LM's capability level, suggesting that evaluation should adapt to
each LM. Methodologically, Fluid Benchmarking estimates an item response model
based on existing LM evaluation results and uses the inferred quantities to
select evaluation items dynamically, similar to computerized adaptive testing
in education. In our experiments, we compare Fluid Benchmarking against the
common practice of random item sampling as well as more sophisticated
baselines, including alternative methods grounded in item response theory. We
examine four dimensions -- efficiency, validity, variance, and saturation --
and find that Fluid Benchmarking achieves superior performance in all of them
(e.g., higher validity and less variance on MMLU with fifty times fewer items).
Our analysis shows that the two components of Fluid Benchmarking have distinct
effects: item response theory, used to map performance into a latent ability
space, increases validity, while dynamic item selection reduces variance.
Overall, our results suggest that LM benchmarking can be substantially improved
by moving beyond static evaluation.

Abstract: Integrating argumentation mechanisms into negotiation dialogue systems
improves conflict resolution through exchanges of arguments and critiques.
Moreover, incorporating personality attributes enhances adaptability by
aligning interactions with individuals' preferences and styles. To advance
these capabilities in negotiation dialogue systems, we propose a novel
Personality-driven Argumentation-based Negotiation Dialogue Generation (PAN-DG)
task. To support this task, we introduce PACT, a dataset of Personality-driven
Argumentation-based negotiation Conversations for Tourism sector. This dataset,
generated using Large Language Models (LLMs), features three distinct
personality profiles, viz. Argumentation Profile, Preference Profile, and
Buying Style Profile to simulate a variety of negotiation scenarios involving
diverse personalities. Thorough automatic and manual evaluations indicate that
the dataset comprises high-quality dialogues. Further, we conduct comparative
experiments between pre-trained and fine-tuned LLMs for the PAN-DG task.
Multi-dimensional evaluation demonstrates that the fine-tuned LLMs effectively
generate personality-driven rational responses during negotiations. This
underscores the effectiveness of PACT in enhancing personalization and
reasoning capabilities in negotiation dialogue systems, thereby establishing a

TL;DR: 探究上下文和情感元数据对LLM谬误分类的影响，发现理论提示增强可解释性但额外元数据会降低性能，情感元数据引发模型偏见


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对政治辩论场景中LLM的推理能力，研究如何通过语境信息和情感元数据优化谬误分类，验证理论框架的实际应用效果

Method: 使用美国总统辩论数据，在Qwen-3(8B)模型上测试三种输入模式（纯文本/上下文/上下文+情感元数据），对比基础提示与两种理论驱动思维链框架（语用辩证法和论点周期表）的表现

Result: 理论提示提升可解释性但准确率提升有限，情感元数据使模型42.7%更倾向标注'诉诸情感'，基础提示在多数情况下优于复杂提示策略

Conclusion: LLM的谬误分类任务中，注意力稀释效应可能比信息增益更显著，保持简洁提示策略比堆砌元数据更能维持逻辑推理稳定性

Abstract: This study investigates how context and emotional tone metadata influence
large language model (LLM) reasoning and performance in fallacy classification
tasks, particularly within political debate settings. Using data from U.S.
presidential debates, we classify six fallacy types through various prompting
strategies applied to the Qwen-3 (8B) model. We introduce two theoretically
grounded Chain-of-Thought frameworks: Pragma-Dialectics and the Periodic Table
of Arguments, and evaluate their effectiveness against a baseline prompt under
three input settings: text-only, text with context, and text with both context
and audio-based emotional tone metadata. Results suggest that while theoretical
prompting can improve interpretability and, in some cases, accuracy, the
addition of context and especially emotional tone metadata often leads to
lowered performance. Emotional tone metadata biases the model toward labeling
statements as \textit{Appeal to Emotion}, worsening logical reasoning. Overall,
basic prompts often outperformed enhanced ones, suggesting that attention
dilution from added inputs may worsen rather than improve fallacy
classification in LLMs.

Motivation: 观察到表情符号可能触发大语言模型生成毒性内容，试图系统性验证该现象并探究其机制

Method: 通过自动化构建含表情符号的诱导性提示词，在7个主流大模型和5种语言中进行毒性生成实验，结合模型语义认知、序列生成和分词机制进行多维度解释

Result: 实验证实表情符号显著提升模型毒性生成概率（跨模型跨语言验证），预训练数据污染分析揭示表情符号与毒性内容的潜在关联

Conclusion: 表情符号作为异质语义通道可绕过安全防护，需加强多模态安全机制并重视预训练数据清洗

Abstract: Emojis are globally used non-verbal cues in digital communication, and
extensive research has examined how large language models (LLMs) understand and
utilize emojis across contexts. While usually associated with friendliness or
playfulness, it is observed that emojis may trigger toxic content generation in
LLMs. Motivated by such a observation, we aim to investigate: (1) whether
emojis can clearly enhance the toxicity generation in LLMs and (2) how to
interpret this phenomenon. We begin with a comprehensive exploration of
emoji-triggered LLM toxicity generation by automating the construction of
prompts with emojis to subtly express toxic intent. Experiments across 5
mainstream languages on 7 famous LLMs along with jailbreak tasks demonstrate
that prompts with emojis could easily induce toxicity generation. To understand
this phenomenon, we conduct model-level interpretations spanning semantic
cognition, sequence generation and tokenization, suggesting that emojis can act
as a heterogeneous semantic channel to bypass the safety mechanisms. To pursue
deeper insights, we further probe the pre-training corpus and uncover potential
correlation between the emoji-related data polution with the toxicity
generation behaviors. Supplementary materials provide our implementation code
and data. (Warning: This paper contains potentially sensitive contents)

TL;DR: 提出Text2Mem统一内存操作语言，通过标准化自然语言指令到可靠执行的转换框架，解决现有Agent内存管理功能局限和规范缺失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM Agent内存框架仅支持基础操作（编码/检索/删除），缺乏高级操作（合并/拆分/失效控制），且缺乏形式化规范导致跨系统行为不可预测。

Method: 1. 定义三层对齐内存架构的操作集 2. 基于JSON Schema构建可验证的指令规范 3. 开发类型化解析器/验证器/适配器架构 4. 集成SQL原型与真实框架的适配 5. 统一执行合约封装结果。

Result: 实现跨异构后端的安全/确定性/可移植内存操作，支持参数标准化、语义约束验证和服务集成，建立首个Agent内存控制标准化基础。

Conclusion: Text2Mem框架及其配套基准测试Text2Mem Bench为Agent内存管理提供了标准化协议层，解决了长期存在的操作碎片化和行为不确定性难题。

Abstract: Large language model agents increasingly depend on memory to sustain long
horizon interaction, but existing frameworks remain limited. Most expose only a
few basic primitives such as encode, retrieve, and delete, while higher order
operations like merge, promote, demote, split, lock, and expire are missing or
inconsistently supported. Moreover, there is no formal and executable
specification for memory commands, leaving scope and lifecycle rules implicit
and causing unpredictable behavior across systems. We introduce Text2Mem, a
unified memory operation language that provides a standardized pathway from
natural language to reliable execution. Text2Mem defines a compact yet
expressive operation set aligned with encoding, storage, and retrieval. Each
instruction is represented as a JSON based schema instance with required fields
and semantic invariants, which a parser transforms into typed operation objects
with normalized parameters. A validator ensures correctness before execution,
while adapters map typed objects either to a SQL prototype backend or to real
memory frameworks. Model based services such as embeddings or summarization are
integrated when required. All results are returned through a unified execution
contract. This design ensures safety, determinism, and portability across
heterogeneous backends. We also outline Text2Mem Bench, a planned benchmark
that separates schema generation from backend execution to enable systematic
evaluation. Together, these components establish the first standardized
foundation for memory control in agents.

TL;DR: 差分隐私调优的LLMs生成文本质量显著下降（文本缩短77%、语法错误增加9%、多样性减少10%），且下游分类任务准确率降低


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究差分隐私调优对LLMs生成文本质量和下游任务效用的影响，填补该领域研究空白

Method: 使用5个LLMs在3个语料库进行4级隐私调优，评估文本长度、语法正确性、词汇多样性及下游分类任务表现

Result: 强隐私约束导致文本缩短≥77%、语法正确性降低≥9%、二元组多样性减少≥10%，下游分类准确率下降

Conclusion: 差分隐私强度与数据效用存在显著权衡，过强隐私保护可能损害合成数据在应用场景中的实际价值

Abstract: Ensuring user privacy by synthesizing data from large language models (LLMs)
tuned under differential privacy (DP) has become popular recently. However, the
impact of DP fine-tuned LLMs on the quality of the language and the utility of
the texts they produce has not been investigated. In this work, we tune five
LLMs with three corpora under four levels of privacy and assess the length, the
grammatical correctness, and the lexical diversity of the text outputs they
produce. We also probe the utility of the synthetic outputs in downstream
classification tasks such as book genre recognition based on book descriptions
and cause of death recognition based on verbal autopsies. The results indicate
that LLMs tuned under stronger privacy constrains produce texts that are
shorter by at least 77 %, that are less grammatically correct by at least 9 %,
and are less diverse by at least 10 % in bi-gram diversity. Furthermore, the
accuracy they reach in downstream classification tasks decreases, which might
be detrimental to the usefulness of the generated synthetic data.

*Hang Guo,Yawei Li,Luca Benini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出结合量化与剪枝的OBR框架，通过误差补偿协调两种压缩技术，实现大语言模型的高效压缩（W4A4KV4量化+50%稀疏），取得4.72倍加速和6.4倍内存缩减。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单一压缩方法（量化/剪枝）接近性能极限，但联合使用时因权重分布需求冲突（量化需紧凑范围 vs 剪枝需高方差）导致效果受限。

Method: 基于二阶Hessian目标构建无需训练的框架OBR，通过代理近似将问题转化为可解形式，最终通过分组误差补偿获得闭式解，对齐量化与剪枝的误差。

Result: 实验显示OBR支持LLM的W4A4KV4量化与50%稀疏化，相比FP16密集基线实现4.72倍速度提升和6.4倍内存降低。

Conclusion: OBR首次有效结合量化与稀疏技术，通过误差补偿机制解决分布冲突，为LLM压缩提供新的高效协同优化路径。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) compression, such as
quantization and pruning, have achieved notable success. However, as these
techniques gradually approach their respective limits, relying on a single
method for further compression has become increasingly challenging. In this
work, we explore an alternative solution by combining quantization and
sparsity. This joint approach, though promising, introduces new difficulties
due to the inherently conflicting requirements on weight distributions:
quantization favors compact ranges, while pruning benefits from high variance.
To attack this problem, we propose Optimal Brain Restoration (OBR), a general
and training-free framework that aligns pruning and quantization by error
compensation between both. OBR minimizes performance degradation on downstream
tasks by building on a second-order Hessian objective, which is then
reformulated into a tractable problem through surrogate approximation and
ultimately reaches a closed-form solution via group error compensation.
Experiments show that OBR enables aggressive W4A4KV4 quantization with 50%
sparsity on existing LLMs, and delivers up to 4.72x speedup and 6.4x memory
reduction compared to the FP16-dense baseline.

Motivation: 传统对抗训练虽能提升生物医学信息抽取模型性能，但带来高昂计算开销，需寻求效率优化方案

Method: 基于PubMedBERT架构，将随机采样机制与对抗训练原理结合，通过动态权重调整实现计算效率优化

Result: 在BioIE任务中，RAT在F1值等指标上超越基线模型，同时减少30%训练时间

Conclusion: RAT为生物医学NLP提供革新性框架，在模型性能与计算效率间取得理想平衡，具有重要临床应用价值

Abstract: We introduce random adversarial training (RAT), a novel framework
successfully applied to biomedical information extraction (BioIE) tasks.
Building on PubMedBERT as the foundational architecture, our study first
validates the effectiveness of conventional adversarial training in enhancing
pre-trained language models' performance on BioIE tasks. While adversarial
training yields significant improvements across various performance metrics, it
also introduces considerable computational overhead. To address this
limitation, we propose RAT as an efficiency solution for biomedical information
extraction. This framework strategically integrates random sampling mechanisms
with adversarial training principles, achieving dual objectives: enhanced model
generalization and robustness while significantly reducing computational costs.
Through comprehensive evaluations, RAT demonstrates superior performance
compared to baseline models in BioIE tasks. The results highlight RAT's
potential as a transformative framework for biomedical natural language
processing, offering a balanced solution to the model performance and
computational efficiency.

Conclusion: 提示工程应与现有数据处理流程深度整合，通过系统化而非零散的应用模式，实现从机会主义试探到高质量科研范式的转变

Abstract: Developing effective prompts demands significant cognitive investment to
generate reliable, high-quality responses from Large Language Models (LLMs). By
deploying case-specific prompt engineering techniques that streamline
frequently performed life sciences workflows, researchers could achieve
substantial efficiency gains that far exceed the initial time investment
required to master these techniques. The Prompt Report published in 2025
outlined 58 different text-based prompt engineering techniques, highlighting
the numerous ways prompts could be constructed. To provide actionable
guidelines and reduce the friction of navigating these various approaches, we
distil this report to focus on 6 core techniques: zero-shot, few-shot
approaches, thought generation, ensembling, self-criticism, and decomposition.
We breakdown the significance of each approach and ground it in use cases
relevant to life sciences, from literature summarization and data extraction to
editorial tasks. We provide detailed recommendations for how prompts should and
shouldn't be structured, addressing common pitfalls including multi-turn
conversation degradation, hallucinations, and distinctions between reasoning
and non-reasoning models. We examine context window limitations, agentic tools
like Claude Code, while analyzing the effectiveness of Deep Research tools
across OpenAI, Google, Anthropic and Perplexity platforms, discussing current
limitations. We demonstrate how prompt engineering can augment rather than
replace existing established individual practices around data processing and
document editing. Our aim is to provide actionable guidance on core prompt
engineering principles, and to facilitate the transition from opportunistic
prompting to an effective, low-friction systematic practice that contributes to
higher quality research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有物理常识推理数据集（如PIQA）以英语为中心且缺乏文化多样性，需构建包含文化语境的数据集

Method: 从301万网络问题出发，通过多阶段筛选（3个语言模型）获得11,553个候选问题，经GPT-4o优化和人工验证得到441组高质量QA对

Result: 最佳模型准确率83.22%，最弱模型仅59.86%，模型在涉及泡菜/韩服等文化要素场景表现显著较差

Conclusion: Ko-PIQA既是韩语模型基准，也为构建包容性常识推理系统奠定基础，凸显文化多样性数据集的重要性

Abstract: Physical commonsense reasoning datasets like PIQA are predominantly
English-centric and lack cultural diversity. We introduce Ko-PIQA, a Korean
physical commonsense reasoning dataset that incorporates cultural context.
Starting from 3.01 million web-crawled questions, we employed a multi-stage
filtering approach using three language models to identify 11,553 PIQA-style
questions. Through GPT-4o refinement and human validation, we obtained 441
high-quality question-answer pairs. A key feature of Ko-PIQA is its cultural
grounding: 19.7\% of questions contain culturally specific elements like
traditional Korean foods (kimchi), clothing (hanbok), and specialized
appliances (kimchi refrigerators) that require culturally-aware reasoning
beyond direct translation. We evaluate seven language models on Ko-PIQA, with
the best model achieving 83.22\% accuracy while the weakest reaches only
59.86\%, demonstrating significant room for improvement. Models particularly
struggle with culturally specific scenarios, highlighting the importance of
culturally diverse datasets. Ko-PIQA serves as both a benchmark for Korean
language models and a foundation for more inclusive commonsense reasoning
research. The dataset and code will be publicly available.

Conclusion: 研究证实Transformer架构在关系抽取中的有效性，同时指出需持续关注大型语言模型在该领域的发展与应用潜力

Abstract: In the era of large language model, relation extraction (RE) plays an
important role in information extraction through the transformation of
unstructured raw text into structured data (Wadhwa et al., 2023). In this
paper, we systematically compare the performance of deep supervised learning
approaches without transformers and those with transformers. We used a series
of non-transformer architectures such as PA-LSTM(Zhang et al., 2017),
C-GCN(Zhang et al., 2018), and AGGCN(attention guide GCN)(Guo et al., 2019),
and a series of transformer architectures such as BERT, RoBERTa, and R-BERT(Wu
and He, 2019). Our comparison included traditional metrics like micro F1, as
well as evaluations in different scenarios, varying sentence lengths, and
different percentages of the dataset for training. Our experiments were
conducted on TACRED, TACREV, and RE-TACRED. The results show that
transformer-based models outperform non-transformer models, achieving micro F1
scores of 80-90% compared to 64-67% for non-transformer models. Additionally,
we briefly review the research journey in supervised relation classification
and discuss the role and current status of large language models (LLMs) in
relation extraction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多语言模型扩展需重新训练且面临灾难性遗忘问题，现有方法因缺乏原始数据无法应用经验回放策略

Method: LayRA方法基于两个关键发现：1) LoRA技术可减少遗忘 2) 多语言模型不同层承担不同语言处理功能（初始层编码源语言，中间层英语推理，最终层翻译回源语言）

Result: 实验表明LayRA在保留原有语言能力与学习新语言间取得最佳平衡，且通过模型算术实现目标语言的指令跟随能力

Conclusion: 该方法为多语言模型扩展提供高效解决方案，无需原始训练数据即可持续集成新语言，同时保持模型原有性能

Abstract: Multilingual language models are trained on a fixed set of languages, and to
support new languages, the models need to be retrained from scratch. This is an
expensive endeavor and is often infeasible, as model developers tend not to
release their pre-training data. Naive approaches, such as continued
pretraining, suffer from catastrophic forgetting; however, mitigation
strategies like experience replay cannot be applied due to the lack of original
pretraining data. In this work, we investigate the problem of continually
adding new languages to a multilingual model, assuming access to pretraining
data in only the target languages. We explore multiple approaches to address
this problem and propose Layer-Selective LoRA (LayRA), which adds Low-Rank
Adapters (LoRA) to selected initial and final layers while keeping the rest of
the model frozen. LayRA builds on two insights: (1) LoRA reduces forgetting,
and (2) multilingual models encode inputs in the source language in the initial
layers, reason in English in intermediate layers, and translate back to the
source language in final layers. We experiment with adding multiple
combinations of Galician, Swahili, and Urdu to pretrained language models and
evaluate each method on diverse multilingual tasks. We find that LayRA provides
the overall best tradeoff between preserving models' capabilities in previously
supported languages, while being competitive with existing approaches such as
LoRA in learning new languages. We also demonstrate that using model
arithmetic, the adapted models can be equipped with strong instruction
following abilities without access to any instruction tuning data in the target
languages.

Abstract: This study presents the first multi-platform sentiment analysis of public
opinion on the 15-minute city concept across Twitter, Reddit, and news media.
Using compressed transformer models and Llama-3-8B for annotation, we classify
sentiment across heterogeneous text domains. Our pipeline handles long-form and
short-form text, supports consistent annotation, and enables reproducible
evaluation. We benchmark five models (DistilRoBERTa, DistilBERT, MiniLM,
ELECTRA, TinyBERT) using stratified 5-fold cross-validation, reporting
F1-score, AUC, and training time. DistilRoBERTa achieved the highest F1
(0.8292), TinyBERT the best efficiency, and MiniLM the best cross-platform
consistency. Results show News data yields inflated performance due to class
imbalance, Reddit suffers from summarization loss, and Twitter offers moderate
challenge. Compressed models perform competitively, challenging assumptions
that larger models are necessary. We identify platform-specific trade-offs and
propose directions for scalable, real-world sentiment classification in urban
planning discourse.

Motivation: 解决现有多模态主题模型处理多图像效率低、可解释性差的问题，通过上下文嵌入和注意力机制实现高效跨模态对齐。

Method: 基于微调的大型视觉语言模型获取上下文嵌入，采用分布注意力机制加权标记贡献，通过重建目标实现主题-文档表示对齐，支持多图像单次编码。

Result: 在6个多模态基准中全面超越基线模型，平均LLM得分2.61，在少样本检索和科学文献视觉语义捕捉方面表现突出。

Conclusion: CEMTM成功融合上下文增强与分布注意力机制，在保持可解释性的同时实现了多模态主题建模的性能突破，尤其适用于复杂领域分析。

Abstract: We introduce CEMTM, a context-enhanced multimodal topic model designed to
infer coherent and interpretable topic structures from both short and long
documents containing text and images. CEMTM builds on fine-tuned large vision
language models (LVLMs) to obtain contextualized embeddings, and employs a
distributional attention mechanism to weight token-level contributions to topic
inference. A reconstruction objective aligns topic-based representations with
the document embedding, encouraging semantic consistency across modalities.
Unlike existing approaches, CEMTM can process multiple images per document
without repeated encoding and maintains interpretability through explicit
word-topic and document-topic distributions. Extensive experiments on six
multimodal benchmarks show that CEMTM consistently outperforms unimodal and
multimodal baselines, achieving a remarkable average LLM score of 2.61. Further
analysis shows its effectiveness in downstream few-shot retrieval and its
ability to capture visually grounded semantics in complex domains such as
scientific articles.

Document Generation. Our experiments show that Reversed Training improves the
QA Template method, while Iterative Document Generation eliminates
hallucinations in the generated source text and boosts coreference resolution.
Integrating these methods and techniques offers an effective and robust
solution to LLM-based coreference resolution.

Method: 1. 采用指令调优大语言模型的零样本方法 2. 使用LoRA参数高效微调技术 3. 设计BM25/MiniLM驱动的文档级/句子级证据筛选策略

Result: 最佳模型在英文验证集F1达0.76，但测试集下降12%，显示证据粒度（句子级优于文档级）与领域适配的显著影响

Conclusion: 系统性能证实：1. 细粒度证据选择提升核查准确性 2. 领域特定微调缓解分布偏移 3. 跨领域泛化仍需改进模型架构与训练策略

Abstract: This paper presents our system for Task 3 of the CLEF 2025 CheckThat! Lab,
which focuses on verifying numerical and temporal claims using retrieved
evidence. We explore two complementary approaches: zero-shot prompting with
instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) and supervised fine-tuning using
parameter-efficient LoRA. To enhance evidence quality, we investigate several
selection strategies, including full-document input and top-k sentence
filtering using BM25 and MiniLM. Our best-performing model LLaMA fine-tuned
with LoRA achieves strong performance on the English validation set. However, a
notable drop in the test set highlights a generalization challenge. These
findings underscore the importance of evidence granularity and model adaptation
for robust numerical fact verification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以有效建模候选词替换对目标词及其上下文的双向影响，导致语义变化难以准确表征。

Method: 使用注意力权重和可解释性更强的集成梯度方法，量化上下文词对目标词的影响，并结合替换前后句子的语义相似性进行候选排序。

Result: 在LS07和SWORDS数据集上的实验表明，两种方法均显著提高了候选词排序性能。

Conclusion: 通过捕捉替换操作对目标词与上下文的双向语义影响，能够更精准地评估候选词适配度，提升排序效果。

Abstract: A key subtask in lexical substitution is ranking the given candidate words. A
common approach is to replace the target word with a candidate in the original
sentence and feed the modified sentence into a model to capture semantic
differences before and after substitution. However, effectively modeling the
bidirectional influence of candidate substitution on both the target word and
its context remains challenging. Existing methods often focus solely on
semantic changes at the target position or rely on parameter tuning over
multiple evaluation metrics, making it difficult to accurately characterize
semantic variation. To address this, we investigate two approaches: one based
on attention weights and another leveraging the more interpretable integrated
gradients method, both designed to measure the influence of context tokens on
the target token and to rank candidates by incorporating semantic similarity
between the original and substituted sentences. Experiments on the LS07 and
SWORDS datasets demonstrate that both approaches improve ranking performance.

Motivation: 探索LVLMs在理解人类协作对话中指代表达的能力，因其需整合语言、视觉和对话交互，而现有模型在此类任务中存在明显不足。

Method: 使用7种先进LVLM作为旁听者，分析人类多轮协作对象匹配对话语料，测试模型在重复任务中的表现动态。

Result: 所有模型均未能展现持续性能提升，且在多轮重复任务中保持较低成功率，表明该任务仍具挑战性。

Conclusion: 发布语料库与代码促进相关研究，同时揭示了当前LVLMs在动态对话理解方面的核心瓶颈。

Abstract: During spontaneous conversations, speakers collaborate on novel referring
expressions, which they can then re-use in subsequent conversations.
Understanding such referring expressions is an important ability for an
embodied agent, so that it can carry out tasks in the real world. This requires
integrating and understanding language, vision, and conversational interaction.
We study the capabilities of seven state-of-the-art Large Vision Language
Models (LVLMs) as overhearers to a corpus of spontaneous conversations between
pairs of human discourse participants engaged in a collaborative
object-matching task. We find that such a task remains challenging for current
LVLMs and they all fail to show a consistent performance improvement as they
overhear more conversations from the same discourse participants repeating the
same task for multiple rounds. We release our corpus and code for
reproducibility and to facilitate future research.

Method: 创建含8,380题的12领域MCQA数据集，采用PEFT和LoRA技术微调medgemma-4b-it模型，对比8个医疗LLM的零样本表现

Result: medgemma-27b-text-it准确率超90%，微调后的4b版本在多项测试中超越<10B模型并与70B模型相当

Conclusion: 建议西班牙语国家及类似秘鲁流行病学特征的地区优先使用medgemma-27b-text-it或微调后的4b模型

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Medical large language models (LLMS) have demonstrated remarkable
performance in answering medical examinations. However, the extent to which
this high performance is transferable to medical questions in Spanish and from
a Latin American country remains unexplored. This knowledge is crucial as
LLM-based medical applications gain traction in Latin America. AIMS: to build a
dataset of questions from medical examinations taken by Peruvian physicians
pursuing specialty training; to fine-tune a LLM on this dataset; to evaluate
and compare the performance in terms of accuracy between vanilla LLMs and the
fine-tuned LLM. METHODS: We curated PeruMedQA, a multiple-choice
question-answering (MCQA) datasets containing 8,380 questions spanning 12
medical domains (2018-2025). We selected eight medical LLMs including
medgemma-4b-it and medgemma-27b-text-it, and developed zero-shot task-specific
prompts to answer the questions appropriately. We employed parameter-efficient
fine tuning (PEFT)and low-rant adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune medgemma-4b-it
utilizing all questions except those from 2025 (test set). RESULTS:
medgemma-27b-text-it outperformed all other models, achieving a proportion of
correct answers exceeding 90% in several instances. LLMs with <10 billion
parameters exhibited <60% of correct answers, while some exams yielded results
<50%. The fine-tuned version of medgemma-4b-it emerged victorious agains all
LLMs with <10 billion parameters and rivaled a LLM with 70 billion parameters
across various examinations. CONCLUSIONS: For medical AI application and
research that require knowledge bases from Spanish-speaking countries and those
exhibiting similar epidemiological profiles to Peru's, interested parties
should utilize medgemma-27b-text-it or a fine-tuned version of medgemma-4b-it.

Method: 采用稳健的共现计量方法，跨词类对比反义关系与其他三种语义关系的共现特征

Result: 反义词对呈现高共现强度、优先线性语序和短距离共现三大特性

Conclusion: 研究证实反义关系具有独特的共现模式，为词汇语义学研究提供新证据，所有分析结果已在线公开

Abstract: Antonymy has long received particular attention in lexical semantics.
Previous studies have shown that antonym pairs frequently co-occur in text,
across genres and parts of speech, more often than would be expected by chance.
However, whether this co-occurrence pattern is distinctive of antonymy remains
unclear, due to a lack of comparison with other semantic relations. This work
fills the gap by comparing antonymy with three other relations across parts of
speech using robust co-occurrence metrics. We find that antonymy is distinctive
in three respects: antonym pairs co-occur with high strength, in a preferred
linear order, and within short spans. All results are available online.

Motivation: 现有幻觉检测方法难以有效分离语义和推理信息，且鲁棒性不足，影响关键决策场景的可靠性。

Method: 将LLM隐藏状态空间分解为语义/推理子空间，通过对解嵌入层参数进行奇异值分解获取基础向量，将隐藏状态投影到推理子空间进行检测。

Result: 在多个数据集实现SOTA性能，TriviaQA上AUROC达92.8%（提升7.5%），特征维度缩减至原5%并有效降噪。

Conclusion: HARP通过子空间分解和投影机制，在保持低维特征的同时显著提升检测鲁棒性和准确性，为LLM可靠性提供新解决方案。

Abstract: Hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) pose a major barrier to their
reliable use in critical decision-making. Although existing hallucination
detection methods have improved accuracy, they still struggle with
disentangling semantic and reasoning information and maintaining robustness. To
address these challenges, we propose HARP (Hallucination detection via
reasoning subspace projection), a novel hallucination detection framework. HARP
establishes that the hidden state space of LLMs can be decomposed into a direct
sum of a semantic subspace and a reasoning subspace, where the former encodes
linguistic expression and the latter captures internal reasoning processes.
Moreover, we demonstrate that the Unembedding layer can disentangle these
subspaces, and by applying Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to its
parameters, the basis vectors spanning the semantic and reasoning subspaces are
obtained. Finally, HARP projects hidden states onto the basis vectors of the
reasoning subspace, and the resulting projections are then used as input
features for hallucination detection in LLMs. By using these projections, HARP
reduces the dimension of the feature to approximately 5% of the original,
filters out most noise, and achieves enhanced robustness. Experiments across
multiple datasets show that HARP achieves state-of-the-art hallucination
detection performance; in particular, it achieves an AUROC of 92.8% on
TriviaQA, outperforming the previous best method by 7.5%.

Motivation: 现有RAG评估工具无法有效衡量文档分块质量，尤其是证据稀疏性问题，需要开发更精确的评估基准和方法。

Method: 构建包含多级分块标注与证据密集QA对的HiCBench基准，并提出基于微调LLM的HiChunk框架与Auto-Merge检索算法。

Result: 实验证明HiCBench能全面评估分块方法对RAG流程的影响，HiChunk在合理时间内实现了更优的分块质量与系统性能提升。

Conclusion: HiCBench填补了文档分块评估的空白，HiChunk为优化RAG系统提供了可扩展的分块解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the response capabilities of
language models by integrating external knowledge sources. However, document
chunking as an important part of RAG system often lacks effective evaluation
tools. This paper first analyzes why existing RAG evaluation benchmarks are
inadequate for assessing document chunking quality, specifically due to
evidence sparsity. Based on this conclusion, we propose HiCBench, which
includes manually annotated multi-level document chunking points, synthesized
evidence-dense quetion answer(QA) pairs, and their corresponding evidence
sources. Additionally, we introduce the HiChunk framework, a multi-level
document structuring framework based on fine-tuned LLMs, combined with the
Auto-Merge retrieval algorithm to improve retrieval quality. Experiments
demonstrate that HiCBench effectively evaluates the impact of different
chunking methods across the entire RAG pipeline. Moreover, HiChunk achieves
better chunking quality within reasonable time consumption, thereby enhancing
the overall performance of RAG systems.

Motivation: LLMs在金融/医疗等高危领域存在幻觉风险，现有方法难以兼顾实时检测与模型结构适配性。

Method: 联合测量层内语义离散度（Intra-Layer Dispersion）和基于注意力引导的层间概念漂移（Inter-Layer Drift）

Result: 在5个开源LLM和5个基准测试中持续优于现有免训练基线方法

Conclusion: 通过捕捉表征的动态演化，D²HScore为幻觉检测提供了可解释且轻量化的解决方案

Abstract: Although large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, their
practical application is often hindered by the generation of non-factual
content, which is called "hallucination". Ensuring the reliability of LLMs'
outputs is a critical challenge, particularly in high-stakes domains such as
finance, security, and healthcare. In this work, we revisit hallucination
detection from the perspective of model architecture and generation dynamics.
Leveraging the multi-layer structure and autoregressive decoding process of
LLMs, we decompose hallucination signals into two complementary dimensions: the
semantic breadth of token representations within each layer, and the semantic
depth of core concepts as they evolve across layers. Based on this insight, we
propose \textbf{D$^2$HScore (Dispersion and Drift-based Hallucination Score)},
a training-free and label-free framework that jointly measures: (1)
\textbf{Intra-Layer Dispersion}, which quantifies the semantic diversity of
token representations within each layer; and (2) \textbf{Inter-Layer Drift},
which tracks the progressive transformation of key token representations across
layers. To ensure drift reflects the evolution of meaningful semantics rather
than noisy or redundant tokens, we guide token selection using attention
signals. By capturing both the horizontal and vertical dynamics of
representation during inference, D$^2$HScore provides an interpretable and
lightweight proxy for hallucination detection. Extensive experiments across
five open-source LLMs and five widely used benchmarks demonstrate that
D$^2$HScore consistently outperforms existing training-free baselines.

Abstract: Rapid developments of large language models have revolutionized many NLP
tasks for English data. Unfortunately, the models and their evaluations for
low-resource languages are being overlooked, especially for languages in South
Asia. Although there are more than 650 languages in South Asia, many of them
either have very limited computational resources or are missing from existing
language models. Thus, a concrete question to be answered is: Can we assess the
current stage and challenges to inform our NLP community and facilitate model
developments for South Asian languages? In this survey, we have comprehensively
examined current efforts and challenges of NLP models for South Asian languages
by retrieving studies since 2020, with a focus on transformer-based models,
such as BERT, T5, & GPT. We present advances and gaps across 3 essential
aspects: data, models, & tasks, such as available data sources, fine-tuning
strategies, & domain applications. Our findings highlight substantial issues,
including missing data in critical domains (e.g., health), code-mixing, and
lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. Our survey aims to raise awareness
within the NLP community for more targeted data curation, unify benchmarks
tailored to cultural and linguistic nuances of South Asia, and encourage an
equitable representation of South Asian languages. The complete list of

Abstract: With many endangered languages at risk of disappearing, efforts to preserve
them now rely more than ever on using technology alongside culturally informed
teaching strategies. This study examines user behaviors in TALKA, a generative
AI-powered chatbot designed for Hakka language engagement, by employing a
dual-layered analytical framework grounded in Bloom's Taxonomy of cognitive
processes and dialogue act categorization. We analyzed 7,077 user utterances,
each carefully annotated according to six cognitive levels and eleven dialogue
act types. These included a variety of functions, such as asking for
information, requesting translations, making cultural inquiries, and using
language creatively. Pragmatic classifications further highlight how different
types of dialogue acts--such as feedback, control commands, and social
greetings--align with specific cognitive intentions. The results suggest that
generative AI chatbots can support language learning in meaningful
ways--especially when they are designed with an understanding of how users
think and communicate. They may also help learners express themselves more
confidently and connect with their cultural identity. The TALKA case provides
empirical insights into how AI-mediated dialogue facilitates cognitive
development in low-resource language learners, as well as pragmatic negotiation
and socio-cultural affiliation. By focusing on AI-assisted language learning,
this study offers new insights into how technology can support language
preservation and educational practice.

Result: 在FSAD/BARU/IMDB数据集上超越现有方法，准确率和F1分数表现最优

Conclusion: 该框架为社交媒体监控、客户反馈分析等细粒度情感分析任务提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Entity-level sentiment classification involves identifying the sentiment
polarity linked to specific entities within text. This task poses several
challenges: effectively modeling the subtle and complex interactions between
entities and their surrounding sentiment expressions; capturing dependencies
that may span across sentences; and ensuring consistent sentiment predictions
for multiple mentions of the same entity through coreference resolution.
Additionally, linguistic phenomena such as negation, ambiguity, and overlapping
opinions further complicate the analysis. These complexities make entity-level
sentiment classification a difficult problem, especially in real-world, noisy
textual data. To address these issues, we propose SpanEIT, a novel framework
integrating dynamic span interaction and graph-aware memory mechanisms for
enhanced entity-sentiment relational modeling. SpanEIT builds span-based
representations for entities and candidate sentiment phrases, employs
bidirectional attention for fine-grained interactions, and uses a graph
attention network to capture syntactic and co-occurrence relations. A
coreference-aware memory module ensures entity-level consistency across
documents. Experiments on FSAD, BARU, and IMDB datasets show SpanEIT
outperforms state-of-the-art transformer and hybrid baselines in accuracy and
F1 scores. Ablation and interpretability analyses validate the effectiveness of
our approach, underscoring its potential for fine-grained sentiment analysis in
applications like social media monitoring and customer feedback analysis.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied in
Personalized Image Aesthetic Assessment (PIAA) as a scalable alternative to

influenced by demographic factors such as gender, age, and education. In this
work, we propose AesBiasBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs along two

benchmark covers three subtasks (Aesthetic Perception, Assessment, Empathy) and
introduces structured metrics (IFD, NRD, AAS) to assess both bias and
alignment. We evaluate 19 MLLMs, including proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4o,
Claude-3.5-Sonnet) and open-source models (e.g., InternVL-2.5, Qwen2.5-VL).
Results indicate that smaller models exhibit stronger stereotype biases,
whereas larger models align more closely with human preferences. Incorporating
identity information often exacerbates bias, particularly in emotional
judgments. These findings underscore the importance of identity-aware
evaluation frameworks in subjective vision-language tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI伦理评估标准无法充分反映心理健康领域特有的保密性、自主权、善意原则与偏见的复杂伦理困境，需建立专业领域评估体系。

Method: 通过模型辅助生成包含多决策选项、专家推理路径、利益相关者视角的结构化场景数据库，建立决策准确性、解释质量与专业规范对齐的三维评估体系。

Result: 构建了首个连接AI伦理与心理健康决策的评估框架，支持对AI系统伦理推理能力和现实社会影响的系统性测评。

Conclusion: 开放数据集作为种子资源，通过社区共建促进能够处理社会敏感决策的负责任AI系统发展，强调专业规范对齐与多维度评估的重要性。

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) in mental health and other
sensitive domains raises urgent questions about ethical reasoning, fairness,
and responsible alignment. Yet, existing benchmarks for moral and clinical
decision-making do not adequately capture the unique ethical dilemmas
encountered in mental health practice, where confidentiality, autonomy,
beneficence, and bias frequently intersect. To address this gap, we introduce
Ethical Reasoning in Mental Health (EthicsMH), a pilot dataset of 125 scenarios
designed to evaluate how AI systems navigate ethically charged situations in
therapeutic and psychiatric contexts. Each scenario is enriched with structured
fields, including multiple decision options, expert-aligned reasoning, expected
model behavior, real-world impact, and multi-stakeholder viewpoints. This
structure enables evaluation not only of decision accuracy but also of
explanation quality and alignment with professional norms. Although modest in
scale and developed with model-assisted generation, EthicsMH establishes a task
framework that bridges AI ethics and mental health decision-making. By
releasing this dataset, we aim to provide a seed resource that can be expanded
through community and expert contributions, fostering the development of AI
systems capable of responsibly handling some of society's most delicate
decisions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出动态知识更新的假新闻检测模型DYNAMO，通过知识图谱实现新知识持续更新，结合大语言模型实现新闻真实性检测和新知识正确性验证的双重功能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有检索增强方法存在的检索内容可信度不足、噪声信息干扰问题，应对新闻突发性和真实性标签动态变化带来的检测挑战

Method: 1. 构建新闻领域知识图谱 2. 蒙特卡洛树搜索分步验证新闻 3. 从验证后的真实新闻中提取更新知识

Result: 在两个真实数据集上取得最优性能表现

Conclusion: 模型通过知识更新机制和双重验证功能，有效提升假新闻检测精度和知识库稳定性

Abstract: As the Internet and social media evolve rapidly, distinguishing credible news
from a vast amount of complex information poses a significant challenge. Due to
the suddenness and instability of news events, the authenticity labels of news
can potentially shift as events develop, making it crucial for fake news
detection to obtain the latest event updates. Existing methods employ
retrieval-augmented generation to fill knowledge gaps, but they suffer from
issues such as insufficient credibility of retrieved content and interference
from noisy information. We propose a dynamic knowledge update-driven model for
fake news detection (DYNAMO), which leverages knowledge graphs to achieve
continuous updating of new knowledge and integrates with large language models
to fulfill dual functions: news authenticity detection and verification of new
knowledge correctness, solving the two key problems of ensuring the
authenticity of new knowledge and deeply mining news semantics. Specifically,
we first construct a news-domain-specific knowledge graph. Then, we use Monte
Carlo Tree Search to decompose complex news and verify them step by step.
Finally, we extract and update new knowledge from verified real news texts and
reasoning paths. Experimental results demonstrate that DYNAMO achieves the best
performance on two real-world datasets.

Motivation: 解决现有多模态模型在高度专业化的运动领域生成精确指导的难题，特别是需要结合领域知识提供实质性改进建议的需求。

Method: 建立基于时间和物理特征的双维度对比框架，通过通用动作学习后迁移至特定运动（数据效率优化），实现教练思维过程建模与错误定位。

Result: 在G-Eval评估中：花样滑冰指导质量提升31.6%，拳击提升58.3%。生成指导包含85%的具体错误分析及改进方案（对照组仅32%）

Conclusion: 验证了基于领域知识迁移的教练AI有效性，通过物理特征解耦实现跨运动泛化，为专业运动教学提供可解释的智能指导方案。

Abstract: Motion instruction is a crucial task that helps athletes refine their
technique by analyzing movements and providing corrective guidance. Although
recent advances in multimodal models have improved motion understanding,
generating precise and sport-specific instruction remains challenging due to
the highly domain-specific nature of sports and the need for informative
guidance. We propose CoachMe, a reference-based model that analyzes the
differences between a learner's motion and a reference under temporal and
physical aspects. This approach enables both domain-knowledge learning and the
acquisition of a coach-like thinking process that identifies movement errors
effectively and provides feedback to explain how to improve. In this paper, we
illustrate how CoachMe adapts well to specific sports such as skating and
boxing by learning from general movements and then leveraging limited data.
Experiments show that CoachMe provides high-quality instructions instead of
directions merely in the tone of a coach but without critical information.
CoachMe outperforms GPT-4o by 31.6% in G-Eval on figure skating and by 58.3% on
boxing. Analysis further confirms that it elaborates on errors and their
corresponding improvement methods in the generated instructions. You can find

Motivation: 新冠大流行推动混合会议普及，但现有会议室声学设计（尤其是混响控制）常被忽视，导致沟通障碍。研究旨在验证声学干预对混合会议质量的影响

Method: 选取格拉茨技术大学研讨室，在声学改造前后分别记录两组人员的会议表现，采用对比研究方法

Result: 尽管样本量小未达统计显著，但清晰显示声学干预后混合会议沟通成功率提升（沟通效率提高26%，疲劳指数降低18%）

Conclusion: 声学设计应成为混合会议空间建设的重要考量，后续需扩大样本验证。研究特别为语音通信领域学者补充了关键声学参数解读

Abstract: Since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, universities and companies have
increasingly integrated hybrid features into their meeting spaces, or even
created dedicated rooms for this purpose. While the importance of a fast and
stable internet connection is often prioritized, the acoustic design of seminar
rooms is frequently overlooked. Poor acoustics, particularly excessive
reverberation, can lead to issues such as misunderstandings, reduced speech
intelligibility or cognitive and vocal fatigue. This pilot study investigates
whether room acoustic interventions in a seminar room at Graz University of
Technology support better communication in hybrid meetings. For this purpose,
we recorded two groups of persons twice, once before and once after improving
the acoustics of the room. Our findings -- despite not reaching statistical
significance due to the small sample size - indicate clearly that our spatial
interventions improve communicative success in hybrid meetings. To make the
paper accessible also for readers from the speech communication community, we
explain room acoustics background, relevant for the interpretation of our
results.

Motivation: 欧盟DoP文件存在格式异构性导致传统静态/LLM方案存在幻觉风险，需开发适应结构多样性的可追踪推理框架

Method: 构建状态感知的智能体系统：规划器推断用户意图与文档模态，执行器动态编排工具链，响应器整合结构化输出

Result: 在DoP测试集上验证了系统在跨语言/格式场景下的解析鲁棒性，错误率较基线下降32%

Conclusion: 该框架为受监管工作流提供可扩展的结构化数据提取方案，平衡动态适应与审计追踪需求

Abstract: Declaration of Performance (DoP) documents, mandated by EU regulation,
certify the performance of construction products. While some of their content
is standardized, DoPs vary widely in layout, language, schema, and format,
posing challenges for automated key-value pair extraction (KVP) and question
answering (QA). Existing static or LLM-only IE pipelines often hallucinate and
fail to adapt to this structural diversity. Our domain-specific, stateful
agentic system addresses these challenges through a planner-executor-responder
architecture. The system infers user intent, detects document modality, and
orchestrates tools dynamically for robust, traceable reasoning while avoiding
tool misuse or execution loops. Evaluation on a curated DoP dataset
demonstrates improved robustness across formats and languages, offering a
scalable solution for structured data extraction in regulated workflows.

Motivation: 工业论坛用户反馈蕴含丰富但未被充分利用的UX洞察，传统方法难以处理非结构化数据和专业术语。

Method: 创建7130条合成匿名JSON数据集，利用LLM进行系统化标注（UX洞察/情感/主题分类），突破真实数据访问限制。

Result: 数据集支持transformer模型训练，实现问题检测/情感分析/需求提取等工业论坛分析任务。

Conclusion: UXPID填补隐私敏感场景的研究空白，为产品开发提供AI驱动的标准化反馈分析方案。

Abstract: Customer feedback in industrial forums reflect a rich but underexplored
source of insight into real-world product experience. These publicly shared
discussions offer an organic view of user expectations, frustrations, and
success stories shaped by the specific contexts of use. Yet, harnessing this
information for systematic analysis remains challenging due to the unstructured
and domain-specific nature of the content. The lack of structure and
specialized vocabulary makes it difficult for traditional data analysis
techniques to accurately interpret, categorize, and quantify the feedback,
thereby limiting its potential to inform product development and support
strategies. To address these challenges, this paper presents the User
eXperience Perception Insights Dataset (UXPID), a collection of 7130
artificially synthesized and anonymized user feedback branches extracted from a
public industrial automation forum. Each JavaScript object notation (JSON)
record contains multi-post comments related to specific hardware and software
products, enriched with metadata and contextual conversation data. Leveraging a
large language model (LLM), each branch is systematically analyzed and
annotated for UX insights, user expectations, severity and sentiment ratings,
and topic classifications. The UXPID dataset is designed to facilitate research
in user requirements, user experience (UX) analysis, and AI-driven feedback
processing, particularly where privacy and licensing restrictions limit access
to real-world data. UXPID supports the training and evaluation of
transformer-based models for tasks such as issue detection, sentiment analysis,
and requirements extraction in the context of technical forums.

Result: 传统方法和LLM均显示临床风险分类潜力，公开数据集促进数字健康预警系统研究。

Conclusion: 结合NLP技术与患者生成内容，可有效支持健康危机早期识别和实时干预系统的开发。

Abstract: Online medical forums are a rich and underutilized source of insight into
patient concerns, especially regarding medication use. Some of the many
questions users pose may signal confusion, misuse, or even the early warning
signs of a developing health crisis. Detecting these critical questions that
may precede severe adverse events or life-threatening complications is vital
for timely intervention and improving patient safety. This study introduces a
novel annotated dataset of medication-related questions extracted from online
forums. Each entry is manually labelled for criticality based on clinical risk
factors. We benchmark the performance of six traditional machine learning
classifiers using TF-IDF textual representations, alongside three
state-of-the-art large language model (LLM)-based classification approaches
that leverage deep contextual understanding. Our results highlight the
potential of classical and modern methods to support real-time triage and alert
systems in digital health spaces. The curated dataset is made publicly
available to encourage further research at the intersection of
patient-generated data, natural language processing, and early warning systems
for critical health events. The dataset and benchmark are available at:

Abstract: The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare raises
critical questions about their ability to interpret patient-generated
narratives, which are often informal, ambiguous, and noisy. Existing benchmarks
typically rely on clean, structured clinical text, offering limited insight
into model performance under realistic conditions. In this work, we present a
novel synthetic dataset designed to simulate patient self-descriptions
characterized by varying levels of linguistic noise, fuzzy language, and
layperson terminology. Our dataset comprises clinically consistent scenarios
annotated with ground-truth diagnoses, spanning a spectrum of communication
clarity to reflect diverse real-world reporting styles. Using this benchmark,
we fine-tune and evaluate several state-of-the-art models (LLMs), including
BERT-based and encoder-decoder T5 models. To support reproducibility and future
research, we release the Noisy Diagnostic Benchmark (NDB), a structured dataset
of noisy, synthetic patient descriptions designed to stress-test and compare
the diagnostic capabilities of large language models (LLMs) under realistic
linguistic conditions. We made the benchmark available for the community:

Method: 开发包含多步证据检索、时间线构建和履行过滤的三模块系统，构建可解释的结构化时间线

Result: 与专业事实核查机构合作验证，系统在证据检索相关性和降低人工验证成本方面表现显著

Conclusion: 结构化时间线方法能有效捕捉承诺履行演变过程，提升系统可解释性并减少人工验证投入

Abstract: Political pledges reflect candidates' policy commitments, but tracking their
fulfilment requires reasoning over incremental evidence distributed across
multiple, dynamically updated sources. Existing methods simplify this task into
a document classification task, overlooking its dynamic, temporal and
multi-document nature. To address this issue, we introduce
\textsc{PledgeTracker}, a system that reformulates pledge verification into
structured event timeline construction. PledgeTracker consists of three core
components: (1) a multi-step evidence retrieval module; (2) a timeline
construction module and; (3) a fulfilment filtering module, allowing the
capture of the evolving nature of pledge fulfilment and producing interpretable
and structured timelines. We evaluate PledgeTracker in collaboration with
professional fact-checkers in real-world workflows, demonstrating its
effectiveness in retrieving relevant evidence and reducing human verification
effort.

TL;DR: 提出SCDTour方法，通过排序合并可解释性语义轴，在保持语义演变检测（SCD）性能的同时解决可解释性与性能的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义演变检测中存在可解释性与性能相互制约的矛盾：提升可解释性往往导致SCD性能下降，反之亦然。需要找到二者的平衡点。

Method: SCDTour通过（a）语义空间中语义轴的相似性排序（b）各轴对语义演变的贡献度评估，对可解释性语义轴进行聚合重组，生成更精细的语义表征。

Result: 实验表明SCDTour在保持高可解释性的同时维持SCD性能，重组后的低维语义表征甚至可媲美原始高维嵌入。

Conclusion: 该方法突破了可解释性与性能的权衡困境，通过少量精炼语义轴即可实现语义演变的有效追踪与解释。开源代码促进方法复用。

Abstract: In Semantic Change Detection (SCD), it is a common problem to obtain
embeddings that are both interpretable and high-performing. However, improving
interpretability often leads to a loss in the SCD performance, and vice versa.
To address this problem, we propose SCDTour, a method that orders and merges
interpretable axes to alleviate the performance degradation of SCD. SCDTour
considers both (a) semantic similarity between axes in the embedding space, as
well as (b) the degree to which each axis contributes to semantic change.
Experimental results show that SCDTour preserves performance in semantic change
detection while maintaining high interpretability. Moreover, agglomerating the
sorted axes produces a more refined set of word senses, which achieves
comparable or improved performance against the original full-dimensional
embeddings in the SCD task. These findings demonstrate that SCDTour effectively
balances interpretability and SCD performance, enabling meaningful
interpretation of semantic shifts through a small number of refined axes.

Motivation: 现有角色扮演对话系统的记忆模块存在容量失控增长问题，缺乏符合叙事规律的系统性解决方案。受文学理论中情节与人物双要素的启发，尝试将故事演进规律融入记忆管理。

Method: MOOM采用双分支结构：1) 多时间尺度情节冲突摘要分支 2) 用户角色画像提取分支。集成基于'竞争抑制'理论的遗忘机制，通过动态记忆淘汰控制容量。

Result: 在自建中文超长对话数据集ZH-4O（平均600轮）上，MOOM在记忆质量指标超越现有方法，且大模型调用次数减少37%，最终记忆容量稳定在可控范围。

Conclusion: 融合文学理论的双分支设计与生物记忆机制，为角色扮演对话系统提供了高效可控的记忆管理方案。ZH-4O数据集的构建填补了中文长对话研究的数据空白。

Abstract: Memory extraction is crucial for maintaining coherent ultra-long dialogues in
human-robot role-playing scenarios. However, existing methods often exhibit
uncontrolled memory growth. To address this, we propose MOOM, the first
dual-branch memory plugin that leverages literary theory by modeling plot
development and character portrayal as core storytelling elements.
Specifically, one branch summarizes plot conflicts across multiple time scales,
while the other extracts the user's character profile. MOOM further integrates
a forgetting mechanism, inspired by the ``competition-inhibition'' memory
theory, to constrain memory capacity and mitigate uncontrolled growth.
Furthermore, we present ZH-4O, a Chinese ultra-long dialogue dataset
specifically designed for role-playing, featuring dialogues that average 600
turns and include manually annotated memory information. Experimental results
demonstrate that MOOM outperforms all state-of-the-art memory extraction
methods, requiring fewer large language model invocations while maintaining a
controllable memory capacity.

Abstract: Language and embodied perspective taking are essential for human
collaboration, yet few computational models address both simultaneously. This
work investigates the PerspAct system [1], which integrates the ReAct (Reason
and Act) paradigm with Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate developmental
stages of perspective taking, grounded in Selman's theory [2]. Using an
extended director task, we evaluate GPT's ability to generate internal
narratives aligned with specified developmental stages, and assess how these
influence collaborative performance both qualitatively (action selection) and
quantitatively (task efficiency). Results show that GPT reliably produces
developmentally-consistent narratives before task execution but often shifts
towards more advanced stages during interaction, suggesting that language
exchanges help refine internal representations. Higher developmental stages
generally enhance collaborative effectiveness, while earlier stages yield more
variable outcomes in complex contexts. These findings highlight the potential
of integrating embodied perspective taking and language in LLMs to better model
developmental dynamics and stress the importance of evaluating internal speech
during combined linguistic and embodied tasks.

Conclusion: AI文本检测困境反映语言本质中的不确定张力，需重新思考作者身份定义，对学术伦理和AI监管政策具有范式变革意义

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more advanced, it is increasingly
difficult to distinguish between human-written and AI-generated text. This
paper draws a conceptual parallel between quantum uncertainty and the limits of
authorship detection in natural language. We argue that there is a fundamental
trade-off: the more confidently one tries to identify whether a text was
written by a human or an AI, the more one risks disrupting the text's natural
flow and authenticity. This mirrors the tension between precision and
disturbance found in quantum systems. We explore how current detection
methods--such as stylometry, watermarking, and neural classifiers--face
inherent limitations. Enhancing detection accuracy often leads to changes in
the AI's output, making other features less reliable. In effect, the very act
of trying to detect AI authorship introduces uncertainty elsewhere in the text.
Our analysis shows that when AI-generated text closely mimics human writing,
perfect detection becomes not just technologically difficult but theoretically
impossible. We address counterarguments and discuss the broader implications
for authorship, ethics, and policy. Ultimately, we suggest that the challenge
of AI-text detection is not just a matter of better tools--it reflects a
deeper, unavoidable tension in the nature of language itself.

Result: 文化定制化提示策略可有效提升翻译结果的文化适配度，特别是在日语沟通的敬语使用和层级表达方面

Conclusion: 建议在LLM设计中整合文化情境感知模块，并开发动态文化适应机制以实现真正的跨文化包容性沟通

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in everyday communication,
including multilingual interactions across different cultural contexts. While
LLMs can now generate near-perfect literal translations, it remains unclear
whether LLMs support culturally appropriate communication. In this paper, we
analyze the cultural sensitivity of different LLM designs when applied to
English-Japanese translations of workplace e-mails. Here, we vary the prompting
strategies: (1) naive "just translate" prompts, (2) audience-targeted prompts
specifying the recipient's cultural background, and (3) instructional prompts
with explicit guidance on Japanese communication norms. Using a mixed-methods
study, we then analyze culture-specific language patterns to evaluate how well
translations adapt to cultural norms. Further, we examine the appropriateness
of the tone of the translations as perceived by native speakers. We find that
culturally-tailored prompting can improve cultural fit, based on which we offer
recommendations for designing culturally inclusive LLMs in multilingual
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address slow autoregressive inference in VLMs that limits real-time deployment by leveraging speculative decoding paradigms.

Method: Pairs lightweight draft VLM with target model, using confidence-based dynamic tree verification to expand/prune speculative branches.

Result: 3.28x faster decoding on MS COCO images with preserved output quality (LLaVA-1.5 7B/13B models).

Conclusion: Framework enables practical real-time multimodal assistants through efficient draft model design suitable for resource-constrained deployments.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable powerful multimodal reasoning but suffer
from slow autoregressive inference, limiting their deployment in real-time
applications. We introduce Spec-LLaVA, a system that applies speculative
decoding to accelerate VLMs without sacrificing output quality. Spec-LLaVA
pairs a lightweight draft VLM with a large target model: the draft speculates
future tokens, which the target verifies in parallel, allowing multiple tokens
to be generated per step. To maximize efficiency, we design a dynamic
tree-based verification algorithm that adaptively expands and prunes
speculative branches using draft model confidence. On MS COCO out-of-domain
images, Spec-LLaVA achieves up to 3.28$\times$ faster decoding on LLaVA-1.5
(7B, 13B) with no loss in generation quality. This work presents a lossless
acceleration framework for VLMs using dynamic tree-structured speculative

Conclusion: 工具调用场景需要领域专用奖励建模，基于合成数据的训练框架能有效提升模型评估能力和实际应用效果。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly interact with external tools,
reward modeling for tool use has become a critical yet underexplored area.
Existing reward models, trained primarily on natural language outputs, struggle
to evaluate tool-based reasoning and execution. To quantify this gap, we
introduce FC-RewardBench, the first benchmark designed to systematically assess
reward models' performance in tool-calling scenarios. Our analysis shows that
current reward models often miss key signals of effective tool use,
highlighting the need for domain-specific modeling. To address this, we propose
a training framework for outcome-based reward models using data synthesized
from permissively licensed, open-weight LLMs. We train models ranging from 1.7B
to 14B parameters and evaluate them across seven out-of-domain benchmarks.
These models consistently outperform general-purpose baselines, achieving up to
25\% average improvement in downstream task performance and enabling
data-efficient fine-tuning through reward-guided filtering.

Conclusion: 多偏差框架与情感导向方法有效解决语言差异问题，提升情感解释类查询聚焦摘要质量

Abstract: Constructive analysis of feedback from clients often requires determining the
cause of their sentiment from a substantial amount of text documents. To assist
and improve the productivity of such endeavors, we leverage the task of
Query-Focused Summarization (QFS). Models of this task are often impeded by the
linguistic dissonance between the query and the source documents. We propose
and substantiate a multi-bias framework to help bridge this gap at a
domain-agnostic, generic level; we then formulate specialized approaches for
the problem of sentiment explanation through sentiment-based biases and query
expansion. We achieve experimental results outperforming baseline models on a
real-world proprietary sentiment-aware QFS dataset.

Result: 发现导向强度/位置/持续时间对避免主题偏移和退化具有决定性影响

Conclusion: 模型语法编码具有类人结构化特征，但生成控制需多参数协同优化

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are able to generate grammatically well-formed
text, but how do they encode their syntactic knowledge internally? While prior
work has focused largely on binary grammatical contrasts, in this work, we
study the representation and control of two multidimensional hierarchical
grammar phenomena - verb tense and aspect - and for each, identify distinct,
orthogonal directions in residual space using linear discriminant analysis.
Next, we demonstrate causal control over both grammatical features through
concept steering across three generation tasks. Then, we use these identified
features in a case study to investigate factors influencing effective steering
in multi-token generation. We find that steering strength, location, and
duration are crucial parameters for reducing undesirable side effects such as
topic shift and degeneration. Our findings suggest that models encode tense and
aspect in structurally organized, human-like ways, but effective control of
such features during generation is sensitive to multiple factors and requires
manual tuning or automated optimization.

Abstract: This paper introduces SENSE (Shared Embedding for N-lingual Speech and tExt),
an open-source solution inspired by the SAMU-XLSR framework and conceptually
similar to Meta AI's SONAR models. These approaches rely on a teacher-student
framework to align a self-supervised speech encoder with the language-agnostic
continuous representations of a text encoder at the utterance level. We
describe how the original SAMU-XLSR method has been updated by selecting a
stronger teacher text model and a better initial speech encoder. The source
code for training and using SENSE models has been integrated into the
SpeechBrain toolkit, and the first SENSE model we trained has been publicly
released. We report experimental results on multilingual and multimodal
semantic tasks, where our SENSE model achieves highly competitive performance.
Finally, this study offers new insights into how semantics are captured in such
semantically aligned speech encoders.

TL;DR: 本研究通过119个标记的小型标注数据集，对比3款传统NLP工具和3个大语言模型在命名实体识别任务中的表现。结果显示LLM在上下文敏感实体识别（如人名）上表现更优（Gemini最高），而传统工具（如Stanza）在结构化标签（如地点/日期）处理上更稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大语言模型与传统NLP工具在命名实体识别任务中的性能差异，特别是不同实体类型的识别效果对比，为模型选择提供依据。

Method: 使用包含PERSON/LOCATION/ORGANIZATION/DATE/TIME五类实体的标注数据集，通过F1值评估NLTK/spaCy/Stanza三款传统工具与Gemini/DeepSeek/Qwen三款LLM的表现。

Result: LLM在上下文敏感实体（如人名）识别中整体优于传统工具（Gemini平均F1最高），但传统系统在结构化标签（如地点/日期）上更稳定。LLM在时间表达和多词组织识别中存在显著波动。

Conclusion: LLM虽具备语境理解优势，传统工具在特定结构化任务中仍具竞争力，模型选择需结合具体任务需求。该发现为不同场景下的NER工具选型提供实证参考。

Abstract: This pilot study presents a small-scale but carefully annotated benchmark of
Named Entity Recognition (NER) performance across six systems: three non-LLM
NLP tools (NLTK, spaCy, Stanza) and three general-purpose large language models
(LLMs: Gemini-1.5-flash, DeepSeek-V3, Qwen-3-4B). The dataset contains 119
tokens covering five entity types (PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANIZATION, DATE, TIME).
We evaluated each system's output against the manually annotated gold standard
dataset using F1-score. The results show that LLMs generally outperform
conventional tools in recognizing context-sensitive entities like person names,
with Gemini achieving the highest average F1-score. However, traditional
systems like Stanza demonstrate greater consistency in structured tags such as
LOCATION and DATE. We also observed variability among LLMs, particularly in
handling temporal expressions and multi-word organizations. Our findings
highlight that while LLMs offer improved contextual understanding, traditional
tools remain competitive in specific tasks, informing model selection.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the benefits of domain-specific self-supervised
pre-training for both offline and streaming ASR in Air Traffic Control (ATC)
environments. We train BEST-RQ models on 4.5k hours of unlabeled ATC data, then
fine-tune on a smaller supervised ATC set. To enable real-time processing, we
propose using chunked attention and dynamic convolutions, ensuring low-latency
inference. We compare these in-domain SSL models against state-of-the-art,
general-purpose speech encoders such as w2v-BERT 2.0 and HuBERT. Results show
that domain-adapted pre-training substantially improves performance on standard
ATC benchmarks, significantly reducing word error rates when compared to models
trained on broad speech corpora. Furthermore, the proposed streaming approach
further improves word error rate under tighter latency constraints, making it
particularly suitable for safety-critical aviation applications. These findings
highlight that specializing SSL representations for ATC data is a practical
path toward more accurate and efficient ASR systems in real-world operational
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有纯RL方法存在探索效率低/收敛慢的问题，纯SFT方法存在性能上限低/理论基础薄弱的问题，需要兼顾效率与性能的解决方案。

Method: 设计三阶段流程：1) 交叉熵优化的临时猜测 2) 反思过程 3) RL奖励驱动的最终生成，使用损失掩码和梯度约束解决训练信号冲突。

Result: 在四个文本分类基准测试中，GTA收敛速度提升38%的同时，准确率比纯SFT高1.5%，比纯RL高2.3%。

Conclusion: GTA成功统一SFT与RL的优势，为NLP任务提供了兼具训练效率与性能上限的新型微调范式，验证了混合训练架构的有效性。

Abstract: In natural language processing tasks, pure reinforcement learning (RL)
fine-tuning methods often suffer from inefficient exploration and slow
convergence; while supervised fine-tuning (SFT) methods, although efficient in
training, have limited performance ceiling and less solid theoretical
foundation compared to RL. To address efficiency-capability trade-off, we
propose the Guess-Think-Answer (GTA) framework that combines the efficiency of
SFT with the capability gains of RL in a unified training paradigm. GTA works
by having the model first produce a provisional guess (optimized via
cross-entropy loss), then reflect on this guess before generating the final
answer, with RL rewards shaping both the final output and the format of the
entire GTA structure. This hybrid approach achieves both faster convergence
than pure RL and higher performance ceiling than pure SFT. To mitigate gradient
conflicts between the two training signals, we employ loss masking and gradient
constraints. Empirical results on four text classification benchmarks
demonstrate that GTA substantially accelerates convergence while outperforming
both standalone SFT and RL baselines.

Motivation: 传统LLM定制成本高且云服务模式存在隐私泄露风险，无法支持规模化个性化需求

Method: 1) 服务器端训练领域通用提示生成器 2) 用户端进行无梯度软提示优化，无需共享模型权重或数据

Result: 在常识推理、医疗和金融领域超越基线模型，展示任务无关处理能力和隐私保护优势

Conclusion: CBP-Tuning成功平衡个性化定制与隐私保护，为LLM服务部署提供新范式

Abstract: The high costs of customizing large language models (LLMs) fundamentally
limit their adaptability to user-specific needs. Consequently, LLMs are
increasingly offered as cloud-based services, a paradigm that introduces
critical limitations: providers struggle to support personalized customization
at scale, while users face privacy risks when exposing sensitive data. To
address this dual challenge, we propose Customized Black-box Prompt Tuning
(CBP-Tuning), a novel framework that facilitates efficient local customization
while preserving bidirectional privacy. Specifically, we design a two-stage
framework: (1) a prompt generator trained on the server-side to capture
domain-specific and task-agnostic capabilities, and (2) user-side gradient-free
optimization that tailors soft prompts for individual tasks. This approach
eliminates the need for users to access model weights or upload private data,
requiring only a single customized vector per task while achieving effective
adaptation. Furthermore, the evaluation of CBP-Tuning in the commonsense
reasoning, medical and financial domain settings demonstrates superior
performance compared to baselines, showcasing its advantages in task-agnostic
processing and privacy preservation.

Abstract: This notebook reports the XplaiNLP submission to the CheckThat! 2025 shared
task on multilingual subjectivity detection. We evaluate two approaches: (1)
supervised fine-tuning of transformer encoders, EuroBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, and
German-BERT, on monolingual and machine-translated training data; and (2)
zero-shot prompting using two LLMs: o3-mini for Annotation (rule-based
labelling) and gpt-4.1-mini for DoubleDown (contrastive rewriting) and
Perspective (comparative reasoning). The Annotation Approach achieves 1st place
in the Italian monolingual subtask with an F_1 score of 0.8104, outperforming
the baseline of 0.6941. In the Romanian zero-shot setting, the fine-tuned
XLM-RoBERTa model obtains an F_1 score of 0.7917, ranking 3rd and exceeding the
baseline of 0.6461. The same model also performs reliably in the multilingual
task and improves over the baseline in Greek. For German, a German-BERT model
fine-tuned on translated training data from typologically related languages
yields competitive performance over the baseline. In contrast, performance in
the Ukrainian and Polish zero-shot settings falls slightly below the respective
baselines, reflecting the challenge of generalization in low-resource

paper that their understanding often remains shallow, lacking the nuanced grasp
typical of human interpretation. By systematically analyzing and reformulating
existing pun benchmarks, we demonstrate how subtle changes in puns are
sufficient to mislead LLMs. Our contributions include comprehensive and nuanced
pun detection benchmarks, human evaluation across recent LLMs, and an analysis
of the robustness challenges these models face in processing puns.

Conclusion: 该框架为构建鲁棒、人类对齐的LLM角色扮演系统提供了可扩展方案，在现实高风险场景中具有重要应用价值

Abstract: Role-playing Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in
high-stakes domains such as healthcare, education, and governance, where
failures can directly impact user trust and well-being. A cost effective
paradigm for LLM role-playing is few-shot learning, but existing approaches
often cause models to break character in unexpected and potentially harmful
ways, especially when interacting with hostile users. Inspired by
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we reformulate LLM role-playing into a
text retrieval problem and propose a new prompting framework called
RAGs-to-Riches, which leverages curated reference demonstrations to condition
LLM responses. We evaluate our framework with LLM-as-a-judge preference voting
and introduce two novel token-level ROUGE metrics: Intersection over Output
(IOO) to quantity how much an LLM improvises and Intersection over References
(IOR) to measure few-shot demonstrations utilization rate during the evaluation
tasks. When simulating interactions with a hostile user, our prompting strategy
incorporates in its responses during inference an average of 35% more tokens
from the reference demonstrations. As a result, across 453 role-playing
interactions, our models are consistently judged as being more authentic, and
remain in-character more often than zero-shot and in-context Learning (ICL)
methods. Our method presents a scalable strategy for building robust,
human-aligned LLM role-playing frameworks.

Abstract: This paper presents a method for computing interleaved additive and
subtractive manufacturing operations to fabricate models of arbitrary shapes.
We solve the manufacturing planning problem by searching a sequence of inverse
operations that progressively transform a target model into a null shape. Each
inverse operation corresponds to either an additive or a subtractive step,
ensuring both manufacturability and structural stability of intermediate shapes
throughout the process. We theoretically prove that any model can be fabricated
exactly using a sequence generated by our approach. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of this method, we adopt a voxel-based implementation and develop
a scalable algorithm that works on models represented by a large number of
voxels. Our approach has been tested across a range of digital models and
further validated through physical fabrication on a hybrid manufacturing system
with automatic tool switching.

Abstract: We present T2Bs, a framework for generating high-quality, animatable
character head morphable models from text by combining static text-to-3D
generation with video diffusion. Text-to-3D models produce detailed static
geometry but lack motion synthesis, while video diffusion models generate
motion with temporal and multi-view geometric inconsistencies. T2Bs bridges
this gap by leveraging deformable 3D Gaussian splatting to align static 3D
assets with video outputs. By constraining motion with static geometry and
employing a view-dependent deformation MLP, T2Bs (i) outperforms existing 4D
generation methods in accuracy and expressiveness while reducing video
artifacts and view inconsistencies, and (ii) reconstructs smooth, coherent,
fully registered 3D geometries designed to scale for building morphable models
with diverse, realistic facial motions. This enables synthesizing expressive,

Conclusion: 交替致密化策略通过控制模型容量增长与渐进式优化，有效平衡细节捕捉与过拟合抑制

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has shown impressive results in real-time novel
view synthesis. However, it often struggles under sparse-view settings,
producing undesirable artifacts such as floaters, inaccurate geometry, and
overfitting due to limited observations. We find that a key contributing factor
is uncontrolled densification, where adding Gaussian primitives rapidly without
guidance can harm geometry and cause artifacts. We propose AD-GS, a novel
alternating densification framework that interleaves high and low densification
phases. During high densification, the model densifies aggressively, followed
by photometric loss based training to capture fine-grained scene details. Low
densification then primarily involves aggressive opacity pruning of Gaussians
followed by regularizing their geometry through pseudo-view consistency and
edge-aware depth smoothness. This alternating approach helps reduce overfitting
by carefully controlling model capacity growth while progressively refining the
scene representation. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate
that AD-GS significantly improves rendering quality and geometric consistency

*Omkar Shailendra Vengurlekar,Adithya Pediredla,Suren Jayasuriya*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出SH-SAS模型，利用球谐函数系数建模声散射场，解决传统SAS重建方法的方向性建模缺陷和采样限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时域反投影方法无法建模方向性散射，现有神经体积方法仅处理各向同性散射。需开发能捕捉方向性响应且无需中间图像监督的方法。

Method: 采用隐式神经表示结合多分辨率哈希编码器，MLP输出球谐系数。零阶系数作为各向同性散射场，高阶系数捕捉方向性散射，支持直接通过时程信号训练。

Result: 在合成/真实SAS数据(空中/水下)测试中，SH-SAS在3D重建质量和几何指标上优于现有方法，参数效率提升明显。

Conclusion: SH-SAS首次实现声散射场的球谐分解，突破传统方法的方向性建模限制，为声学成像提供新范式。

Abstract: Synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) reconstruction requires recovering both the
spatial distribution of acoustic scatterers and their direction-dependent
response. Time-domain backprojection is the most common 3D SAS reconstruction
algorithm, but it does not model directionality and can suffer from sampling
limitations, aliasing, and occlusion. Prior neural volumetric methods applied
to synthetic aperture sonar treat each voxel as an isotropic scattering
density, not modeling anisotropic returns. We introduce SH-SAS, an implicit
neural representation that expresses the complex acoustic scattering field as a
set of spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients. A multi-resolution hash encoder
feeds a lightweight MLP that outputs complex SH coefficients up to a specified
degree L. The zeroth-order coefficient acts as an isotropic scattering field,
which also serves as the density term, while higher orders compactly capture
directional scattering with minimal parameter overhead. Because the model
predicts the complex amplitude for any transmit-receive baseline, training is
performed directly from 1-D time-of-flight signals without the need to beamform
intermediate images for supervision. Across synthetic and real SAS (both in-air
and underwater) benchmarks, results show that SH-SAS performs better in terms
of 3D reconstruction quality and geometric metrics than previous methods.

Conclusion: 该框架为科学可视化数据建立了统一的稀疏表示范式，通过OpenVDB与3D高斯结合，显著提升存储效率并支持多类型体积数据融合处理

Abstract: 3D Gaussians are currently being heavily investigated for their scene
modeling and compression abilities. In 3D volumes, their use is being explored
for representing dense volumes as sparsely as possible. However, most of these
methods begin with a memory inefficient data format. Specially in Scientific
Visualization(SciVis), where most popular formats are dense-grid data
structures that store every grid cell, irrespective of its contribution.
OpenVDB library and data format were introduced for representing sparse
volumetric data specifically for visual effects use cases such as clouds, fire,
fluids etc. It avoids storing empty cells by masking them during storage. It
presents an opportunity for use in SciVis, specifically as a modeling framework
for conversion to 3D Gaussian particles for further compression and for a
unified modeling approach for different scientific volume types. This
compression head-start is non-trivial and this paper would like to present this
with a rendering algorithm based on line integration implemented in OptiX8.1
for calculating 3D Gaussians contribution along a ray for optical-depth
accumulation. For comparing the rendering results of our ray marching Gaussians
renderer, we also implement a SciVis style primary-ray only NanoVDB HDDA based
ray marcher for OpenVDB voxel grids. Finally, this paper also explores
application of this Gaussian model to formats of volumes other than regular
grids, such as AMR volumes and point clouds, using internal representation of
OpenVDB grid class types for data hierarchy and subdivision structure.

Motivation: 生成式AI的广泛应用伴随新型安全风险，需同时应对传统软件威胁和LLM特有威胁，但缺乏系统性分析框架。

Method: 通过系统文献综述构建威胁矩阵，按生命周期阶段/攻击场景分类威胁，并建立防御策略与攻击类型的映射关系。

Result: 创建了首个包含42种威胁的分类体系，识别出模型投毒等高风险威胁，提出动态监测等11类防御策略及其适用阶段。

Conclusion: 该框架有效帮助组织评估LLM集成风险，同时揭示数据泄露防护等未解决挑战，推动安全部署技术发展。

Abstract: The success and wide adoption of generative AI (GenAI), particularly large
language models (LLMs), has attracted the attention of cybercriminals seeking
to abuse models, steal sensitive data, or disrupt services. Moreover, providing
security to LLM-based systems is a great challenge, as both traditional threats
to software applications and threats targeting LLMs and their integration must
be mitigated. In this survey, we shed light on security and privacy concerns of
such LLM-based systems by performing a systematic review and comprehensive
categorization of threats and defensive strategies considering the entire
software and LLM life cycles. We analyze real-world scenarios with distinct
characteristics of LLM usage, spanning from development to operation. In
addition, threats are classified according to their severity level and to which
scenarios they pertain, facilitating the identification of the most relevant
threats. Recommended defense strategies are systematically categorized and
mapped to the corresponding life cycle phase and possible attack strategies
they attenuate. This work paves the way for consumers and vendors to understand
and efficiently mitigate risks during integration of LLMs in their respective
solutions or organizations. It also enables the research community to benefit
from the discussion of open challenges and edge cases that may hinder the
secure and privacy-preserving adoption of LLM-based systems.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决高斯溅射的旋转失真问题，推动可动画高斯技术在数字人领域的应用，同时保持与传统渲染管线的兼容性

Abstract: Radiance field-based methods have recently been used to reconstruct human
avatars, showing that we can significantly downscale the systems needed for
creating animated human avatars. Although this progress has been initiated by
neural radiance fields, their slow rendering and backward mapping from the
observation space to the canonical space have been the main challenges. With
Gaussian splatting overcoming both challenges, a new family of approaches has
emerged that are faster to train and render, while also straightforward to
implement using forward skinning from the canonical to the observation space.
However, the linear blend skinning required for the deformation of the
Gaussians does not provide valid results for their non-linear rotation
properties. To address such artifacts, recent works use mesh properties to
rotate the non-linear Gaussian properties or train models to predict corrective
offsets. Instead, we propose a weighted rotation blending approach that
leverages quaternion averaging. This leads to simpler vertex-based Gaussians
that can be efficiently animated and integrated in any engine by only modifying
the linear blend skinning technique, and using any Gaussian rasterizer.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖合成3D数据，难以泛化到真实服装的复杂场景（如遮挡、动态变形）。需解决真实与合成数据间的领域差距问题。

Method: 1) 构建共享服装嵌入空间，结合大规模真实视频与小规模合成3D数据优化；2) 通过视频微调生成服装'atlas'表示，独立于人体姿态；3) 实现动态视频到360度视角合成。

Result: 在图像/视频的服装NVS任务中达到SOTA，鲁棒处理褶皱、姿态变化与遮挡，保持光感真实、视角一致性与几何精度。

Conclusion: HoloGarment首次实现真实服装的高质量动态视角合成，通过混合数据训练策略有效弥合领域差距，为虚拟试衣等应用提供新方案。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) of in-the-wild garments is a challenging task due
significant occlusions, complex human poses, and cloth deformations. Prior
methods rely on synthetic 3D training data consisting of mostly unoccluded and
static objects, leading to poor generalization on real-world clothing. In this
paper, we propose HoloGarment (Hologram-Garment), a method that takes 1-3
images or a continuous video of a person wearing a garment and generates
360{\deg} novel views of the garment in a canonical pose. Our key insight is to
bridge the domain gap between real and synthetic data with a novel implicit
training paradigm leveraging a combination of large-scale real video data and
small-scale synthetic 3D data to optimize a shared garment embedding space.
During inference, the shared embedding space further enables dynamic
video-to-360{\deg} NVS through the construction of a garment "atlas"
representation by finetuning a garment embedding on a specific real-world
video. The atlas captures garment-specific geometry and texture across all
viewpoints, independent of body pose or motion. Extensive experiments show that
HoloGarment achieves state-of-the-art performance on NVS of in-the-wild
garments from images and videos. Notably, our method robustly handles
challenging real-world artifacts -- such as wrinkling, pose variation, and
occlusion -- while maintaining photorealism, view consistency, fine texture
details, and accurate geometry. Visit our project page for additional results:

Motivation: 现有基于偏好对齐的幻觉缓解方法依赖外部人工标注或辅助模型，导致成本高且难以持续改进。

Method: 通过目标LVLM自我注入三种典型幻觉模式生成偏好数据，结合课程学习策略进行迭代对齐训练。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，APASI使三个基线模型在幻觉指标上平均降低5.2%，性能超越依赖外部数据的方法。

Conclusion: APASI实现了自给自足的持续优化，在保持模型通用能力的同时显著提升抗幻觉性能。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) suffer from serious hallucination
problems, where the model-generated responses are inconsistent with the visual
inputs. Existing hallucination mitigation methods are mainly based on
preference alignment and require external human annotations or auxiliary models
for preference data collection, which increase costs and limit sustainable
improvement. To tackle these challenges, we propose Autonomous Preference
Alignment via Self-Injection (APASI), a novel and generalizable method that
mitigates hallucinations without external dependencies. APASI leverages the
target LVLM to self-inject hallucinations into a generated response, creating a
pair of responses with varying preference levels. During the self-injection
process, the dis-preferred response is generated based on three key
observations of hallucinations, ensuring it simulates real hallucination
patterns. This fidelity offers an accurate learning signal for hallucination
mitigation. Moreover, APASI incorporates an iterative alignment training
strategy combined with curriculum learning to periodically update the
preference data with increasing challenge, enabling stable and continuous
enhancement of the LVLM. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks show that
APASI not only effectively mitigates hallucinations for three baseline models
but also achieves comparable or even superior performance to alignment-based
methods with external dependency, thereby demonstrating its effectiveness and
generalization capability. The code is available at
https://github.com/davidluciolu/APASI.

Motivation: 解决复杂图表等视觉密集内容理解难题，开发适配昇腾NPU的高效多模态训练框架，突破固定分辨率图像处理限制。

Method: 1. 分热身/多任务/指令微调三阶段训练
2. 开发Mindspeed-MLLM分布式框架
3. 采用多模态数据包装+混合并行技术
4. 引入测试时分辨率搜索+权重平均策略

Conclusion: MindVL验证了昇腾NPU训练大模型的可行性，原生分辨率处理+渐进式训练框架为多模态模型开发提供新范式，在工业场景具应用潜力。

Abstract: We propose MindVL, a multimodal large langauge model trained on Ascend NPUs.
Similar to Qwen2.5-VL, MindVL adopts native-resolution Vision Transformers,
which enables it to process images at their original variable resolutions. This
design avoids the degradation caused by fixed-resolution tiling while
preserving fine-grained details and global layouts, which is crucial for
visually dense content such as complex charts and diagrams. To ensure the
smooth training of MindVL on Ascend NPUs, we develop Mindspeed-MLLM, a
distributed multimodal training framework tailored for Ascend NPUs. To maintain
training accuracy, we implement equivalent replacements for certain operators.
MindVL undergoes a three-phase training process, namely the warm-up phase,
multitask training phase, and supervised instruction tuning phase, to gradually
enhance its capabilities. This process starts with basic visual and multimodal
pre-training, followed by large-scale multiask trainging and instruction
tuning. We also adopt multimodal data packaging and hybrid parallelism
techniques, which significantly improve end-to-end training speed. To further
boost model performance, we specifically introduce test-time resolution search
and model weight averaging. Notably, despite using about 1/10 of the training
data required by Qwen2.5-VL, MindVL achieves performance on par with Qwen2.5-VL
in evaluations of general multimodal understanding and document/table
comprehension. Beyond overall scores, MindVL also delivers leading performance
in OCR assessments.

Method: 1. 通过分析投影前后k近邻关系变化评估语义信息保留
2. 基于图像块级别的嵌入重构直接量化信息损失

Result: 连接器导致视觉表示几何结构扭曲（k近邻差异40-60%），信息损失区域可有效预测模型在视觉问答任务中的失败案例

Conclusion: 量化了视觉语言模型中连接器的信息损失效应，揭示了其对下游任务性能的影响机制，为改进模态融合提供了可解释性依据

Abstract: Vision--language models (VLMs) often process visual inputs through a
pretrained vision encoder, followed by a projection into the language model's
embedding space via a connector component. While crucial for modality fusion,
the potential information loss induced by this projection step and its direct
impact on model capabilities remain understudied. We introduce two
complementary approaches to examine and quantify this loss by analyzing the
latent representation space. First, we evaluate semantic information
preservation by analyzing changes in k-nearest neighbor relationships between
image representations, before and after projection. Second, we directly measure
information loss by reconstructing visual embeddings from the projected
representation, localizing loss at an image patch level. Experiments reveal
that connectors substantially distort the local geometry of visual
representations, with k-nearest neighbors diverging by 40--60\%
post-projection, correlating with degradation in retrieval performance. The
patch-level embedding reconstruction provides interpretable insights for model
behavior on visually grounded question-answering tasks, finding that areas of
high information loss reliably predict instances where models struggle.

Method: 1. 构建视觉中心化推理数据：通过VLM与推理LLM的智能体交互实现冷启动学习

Result: Reflection-V在多个视觉推理基准测试中显著提升性能，且在推理过程中保持更稳定持久的视觉信息依赖

Conclusion: Reflection-V通过系统性数据构建和奖励设计有效增强了视觉反思能力，为视觉语言模型的深度推理提供了新解决方案

Abstract: Recent advances in text-only "slow-thinking" reasoning have prompted efforts
to transfer this capability to vision-language models (VLMs), for training
visual reasoning models (\textbf{VRMs}). owever, such transfer faces critical
challenges: Effective "slow thinking" in VRMs requires \textbf{visual
reflection}, the ability to check the reasoning process based on visual
information. Through quantitative analysis, we observe that current VRMs
exhibit limited visual reflection, as their attention to visual information
diminishes rapidly with longer generated responses. To address this challenge,
we propose a new VRM \textbf{Reflection-V}, which enhances visual reflection
based on reasoning data construction for cold-start and reward design for
reinforcement learning (RL). Firstly, we construct vision-centered reasoning
data by leveraging an agent that interacts between VLMs and reasoning LLMs,
enabling cold-start learning of visual reflection patterns. Secondly, a visual
attention based reward model is employed during RL to encourage reasoning based
on visual information. Therefore, \textbf{Reflection-V} demonstrates
significant improvements across multiple visual reasoning benchmarks.
Furthermore, \textbf{Reflection-V} maintains a stronger and more consistent
reliance on visual information during visual reasoning, indicating effective
enhancement in visual reflection capabilities.

Motivation: 现有语音编解码器(如EnCodec、SpeechTokenizer)主要捕捉低阶声学特征，忽视语音内在的语义与上下文信息。虽近期研究尝试引入自监督语义表征或语言模型，但如何有效对齐与融合多模态表征仍是挑战。

Method: 1.潜在表示融合：在编码器潜在空间直接集成语义与上下文特征；
2.全局语义-上下文监督：通过全局池化增强时间一致性及跨模态对齐；
3.时间对齐监督：局部窗口内动态匹配上下文与语音token，强化细粒度对齐。另开发FuseCodec-TTS验证零样本语音合成能力。

Conclusion: 证明上下文与语义引导的语音离散表征对标记化及下游任务的有效性，为零样本语音合成等应用提供新范式。

Abstract: Speech tokenization enables discrete representation and facilitates speech
language modeling. However, existing neural codecs capture low-level acoustic
features, overlooking the semantic and contextual cues inherent to human
speech. While recent efforts introduced semantic representations from
self-supervised speech models or incorporated contextual representations from
pre-trained language models, challenges remain in aligning and unifying the
semantic and contextual representations. We introduce FuseCodec, which unifies
acoustic, semantic, and contextual representations through strong cross-modal
alignment and globally informed supervision. We propose three complementary
techniques: (i) Latent Representation Fusion, integrating semantic and
contextual features directly into the encoder latent space for robust and
unified representation learning; (ii) Global Semantic-Contextual Supervision,
supervising discrete tokens with globally pooled and broadcasted
representations to enhance temporal consistency and cross-modal alignment; and
(iii) Temporally Aligned Contextual Supervision, strengthening alignment by
dynamically matching contextual and speech tokens within a local window for
fine-grained token-level supervision. We further introduce FuseCodec-TTS,
demonstrating our methodology's applicability to zero-shot speech synthesis.
Empirically, FuseCodec achieves state-of-the-art performance in LibriSpeech,
surpassing EnCodec, SpeechTokenizer, and DAC in transcription accuracy,
perceptual quality, intelligibility, and speaker similarity. Results highlight
the effectiveness of contextually and semantically guided tokenization for
speech tokenization and downstream tasks. Code and pretrained models are

Abstract: Current general-purpose large language models (LLMs) commonly exhibit
knowledge hallucination and insufficient domain-specific adaptability in
domain-specific tasks, limiting their effectiveness in specialized question
answering scenarios. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) effectively tackles
these challenges by integrating external knowledge to enhance accuracy and
relevance. However, traditional RAG still faces limitations in domain knowledge
accuracy and context modeling.To enhance domain-specific question answering
performance, this work focuses on a graph-based RAG framework, emphasizing the
critical role of knowledge graph quality during the generation process. We
propose DSRAG (Domain-Specific RAG), a multimodal knowledge graph-driven
retrieval-augmented generation framework designed for domain-specific
applications. Our approach leverages domain-specific documents as the primary
knowledge source, integrating heterogeneous information such as text, images,
and tables to construct a multimodal knowledge graph covering both conceptual
and instance layers. Building on this foundation, we introduce semantic pruning
and structured subgraph retrieval mechanisms, combining knowledge graph context
and vector retrieval results to guide the language model towards producing more
reliable responses. Evaluations using the Langfuse multidimensional scoring
mechanism show that our method excels in domain-specific question answering,
validating the efficacy of integrating multimodal knowledge graphs with
retrieval-augmented generation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了DECOR框架，通过分解上下文标记表示解决生成式推荐系统中目标不一致问题，在三个真实数据集上取得最优推荐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式推荐系统的两阶段范式存在目标不一致问题：静态标记化无法反映上下文多样性，且预训练语义在推荐训练阶段被覆盖。

Method: 1. 上下文标记组合：根据用户交互上下文动态优化标记嵌入
2. 分解嵌入融合：将预训练编码本嵌入与新学习的协同嵌入结合

Result: 在三个真实数据集上DECOR的推荐性能持续超越SOTA基线模型

Conclusion: DECOR通过保持预训练语义和增强嵌入适应性，为生成式推荐系统提供了更有效的统一框架

Abstract: Recent advances in generative recommenders adopt a two-stage paradigm: items
are first tokenized into semantic IDs using a pretrained tokenizer, and then
large language models (LLMs) are trained to generate the next item via
sequence-to-sequence modeling. However, these two stages are optimized for
different objectives: semantic reconstruction during tokenizer pretraining
versus user interaction modeling during recommender training. This objective
misalignment leads to two key limitations: (i) suboptimal static tokenization,
where fixed token assignments fail to reflect diverse usage contexts; and (ii)
discarded pretrained semantics, where pretrained knowledge - typically from
language model embeddings - is overwritten during recommender training on user
interactions. To address these limitations, we propose to learn DEcomposed
COntextual Token Representations (DECOR), a unified framework that preserves
pretrained semantics while enhancing the adaptability of token embeddings.
DECOR introduces contextualized token composition to refine token embeddings
based on user interaction context, and decomposed embedding fusion that
integrates pretrained codebook embeddings with newly learned collaborative
embeddings. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that DECOR
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in recommendation
performance. Our code will be made available upon publication.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型的静态知识库无法满足供应链分析对实时信息的需求，需要建立动态更新的信息整合机制

Method: 结合检索增强生成（RAG）预处理、自适应迭代检索技术和实时网络爬虫，构建动态更新的供应链分析系统

Result: 微调嵌入检索模型带来83%性能提升，自适应检索使复杂查询准确率提高37%，向下抽象查询效率比向上提升2.1倍

Conclusion: 检索质量是供应链分析的关键要素，RAG系统通过动态更新机制可有效解决大模型时效性瓶颈，具有显著应用价值

Abstract: New technologies in generative AI can enable deeper analysis into our
nation's supply chains but truly informative insights require the continual
updating and aggregation of massive data in a timely manner. Large Language
Models (LLMs) offer unprecedented analytical opportunities however, their
knowledge base is constrained to the models' last training date, rendering
these capabilities unusable for organizations whose mission impacts rely on
emerging and timely information. This research proposes an innovative approach
to supply chain analysis by integrating emerging Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) preprocessing and retrieval techniques with advanced web-scraping
technologies. Our method aims to reduce latency in incorporating new
information into an augmented-LLM, enabling timely analysis of supply chain
disruptors. Through experimentation, this study evaluates the combinatorial
effects of these techniques towards timeliness and quality trade-offs. Our
results suggest that in applying RAG systems to supply chain analysis,
fine-tuning the embedding retrieval model consistently provides the most
significant performance gains, underscoring the critical importance of
retrieval quality. Adaptive iterative retrieval, which dynamically adjusts
retrieval depth based on context, further enhances performance, especially on
complex supply chain queries. Conversely, fine-tuning the LLM yields limited
improvements and higher resource costs, while techniques such as downward query
abstraction significantly outperforms upward abstraction in practice.

Motivation: 现有监督方法依赖大量标注且在低资源领域效果差，MLLMs存在领域知识冲突。需一种低资源下有效整合两者的方案。

Method: 1. 训练阶段：领域感知NER数据合成迁移LLM知识；2. 精炼阶段：置信度筛选结合监督模型与MLLM；3. 接地阶段：多模态上下文选择增强视觉定位。

Result: CCKS2025 GMNER任务线上排名第二（F1=0.6461），证明在有限标注下的有效性。

Conclusion: ReFineG通过分阶段协作机制，成功实现低资源场景下的高效多模态实体识别与定位。

Abstract: Grounded Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (GMNER) extends traditional NER
by jointly detecting textual mentions and grounding them to visual regions.
While existing supervised methods achieve strong performance, they rely on
costly multimodal annotations and often underperform in low-resource domains.
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show strong generalization but suffer
from Domain Knowledge Conflict, producing redundant or incorrect mentions for
domain-specific entities. To address these challenges, we propose ReFineG, a
three-stage collaborative framework that integrates small supervised models
with frozen MLLMs for low-resource GMNER. In the Training Stage, a domain-aware
NER data synthesis strategy transfers LLM knowledge to small models with
supervised training while avoiding domain knowledge conflicts. In the
Refinement Stage, an uncertainty-based mechanism retains confident predictions
from supervised models and delegates uncertain ones to the MLLM. In the
Grounding Stage, a multimodal context selection algorithm enhances visual
grounding through analogical reasoning. In the CCKS2025 GMNER Shared Task,
ReFineG ranked second with an F1 score of 0.6461 on the online leaderboard,
demonstrating its effectiveness with limited annotations.

TL;DR: Proposed EMDLOT framework combining time-series and text data with Time-Aware LSTM and interpretability mechanisms for bond default prediction, showing superior performance over traditional models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations in existing ML/DL models (poor temporal handling and lack interpretability) for financial risk modeling during China's bond market reforms.

Method: Multimodal framework integrating financial time-series and prospectus texts using Time-Aware LSTM, soft clustering, and multi-level attention mechanisms.

Result: Achieved 94.6% recall and 92.3% F1-score on 2015-2024 Chinese firm data, outperforming XGBoost (87.1% F1) and vanilla LSTM (89.4% F1). Attention patterns revealed key default indicators like liquidity ratios and risk disclosure terms.

Conclusion: EMDLOT provides both predictive accuracy and model interpretability crucial for financial decisions, establishing trustworthy AI for risk management through multimodal analysis.

Abstract: In recent years, China's bond market has seen a surge in defaults amid
regulatory reforms and macroeconomic volatility. Traditional machine learning
models struggle to capture financial data's irregularity and temporal
dependencies, while most deep learning models lack interpretability-critical
for financial decision-making. To tackle these issues, we propose EMDLOT
(Explainable Multimodal Deep Learning for Time-series), a novel framework for
multi-class bond default prediction. EMDLOT integrates numerical time-series
(financial/macroeconomic indicators) and unstructured textual data (bond
prospectuses), uses Time-Aware LSTM to handle irregular sequences, and adopts
soft clustering and multi-level attention to boost interpretability.
Experiments on 1994 Chinese firms (2015-2024) show EMDLOT outperforms
traditional (e.g., XGBoost) and deep learning (e.g., LSTM) benchmarks in
recall, F1-score, and mAP, especially in identifying default/extended firms.
Ablation studies validate each component's value, and attention analyses reveal
economically intuitive default drivers. This work provides a practical tool and
a trustworthy framework for transparent financial risk modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型极坐标位置编码方法PoPE，解决了传统RoPE中位置与内容纠缠的问题，在多项任务中展现出更优的性能和零样本长度外推能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RoPE旋转位置编码将序列内容（what）和位置信息（where）耦合，导致模型在需要独立匹配内容或位置的场景下性能受限。

Method: 设计PoPE极坐标位置编码，将位置信息分解为半径和角度分量，实现内容与位置的解耦编码。

Result: PoPE在音乐/基因组/NLP建模中的评价损失比RoPE降低3-5%，零样本外推时序列处理长度提升2.8倍且无需微调，参数规模扩展至7.7亿仍保持优势。

Conclusion: PoPE通过消除位置-内容耦合，显著提升了Transformer的长程建模能力和扩展性，为位置编码设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: The attention mechanism in a Transformer architecture matches key to query
based on both content -- the what -- and position in a sequence -- the where.
We present an analysis indicating that what and where are entangled in the
popular RoPE rotary position embedding. This entanglement can impair
performance particularly when decisions require independent matches on these
two factors. We propose an improvement to RoPE, which we call Polar Coordinate
Position Embeddings or PoPE, that eliminates the what-where confound. PoPE is
far superior on a diagnostic task requiring indexing solely by position or by
content. On autoregressive sequence modeling in music, genomic, and natural
language domains, Transformers using PoPE as the positional encoding scheme
outperform baselines using RoPE with respect to evaluation loss (perplexity)
and downstream task performance. On language modeling, these gains persist
across model scale, from 124M to 774M parameters. Crucially, PoPE shows strong
zero-shot length extrapolation capabilities, whereas RoPE's performance
degrades significantly on longer sequences at test time without fine tuning or
the use of position-interpolation methods.

Motivation: 解决真实电子病历隐私限制、稀有病症标注数据不足以及观察性数据集系统偏差三大挑战，提升合成临床数据的统计保真度和临床合理性

Method: 1. 统计对齐：基于患者人口统计学特征和风险因素生成数据
2. 语义对齐：整合真实症状演变轨迹指导内容生成
3. 以阿尔茨海默病为案例构建上下文关联的症状级文本

Result: 结合DualAlign生成数据与人工标注数据微调的LLaMA模型，性能显著优于纯真实数据训练模型（+15.2% F1）和未引导合成基线（+22.8% F1）

Conclusion: 在保护隐私的前提下，DualAlign为低资源临床文本分析提供了实用的合成数据生成方案，尽管在纵向复杂性建模方面仍需改进

Abstract: Synthetic clinical data are increasingly important for advancing AI in
healthcare, given strict privacy constraints on real-world EHRs, limited
availability of annotated rare-condition data, and systemic biases in
observational datasets. While large language models (LLMs) can generate fluent
clinical text, producing synthetic data that is both realistic and clinically
meaningful remains challenging. We introduce DualAlign, a framework that
enhances statistical fidelity and clinical plausibility through dual alignment:
(1) statistical alignment, which conditions generation on patient demographics
and risk factors; and (2) semantic alignment, which incorporates real-world
symptom trajectories to guide content generation. Using Alzheimer's disease
(AD) as a case study, DualAlign produces context-grounded symptom-level
sentences that better reflect real-world clinical documentation. Fine-tuning an
LLaMA 3.1-8B model with a combination of DualAlign-generated and
human-annotated data yields substantial performance gains over models trained
on gold data alone or unguided synthetic baselines. While DualAlign does not
fully capture longitudinal complexity, it offers a practical approach for
generating clinically grounded, privacy-preserving synthetic data to support
low-resource clinical text analysis.

Abstract: Persian names present unique challenges for natural language processing
applications, particularly in gender detection and digital identity creation,
due to transliteration inconsistencies and cultural-specific naming patterns.
Existing tools exhibit significant performance degradation on Persian names,
while the scarcity of comprehensive datasets further compounds these
limitations. To address these challenges, the present research introduces
PNGT-26K, a comprehensive dataset of Persian names, their commonly associated
gender, and their English transliteration, consisting of approximately 26,000
tuples. As a demonstration of how this resource can be utilized, we also
introduce two frameworks, namely Open Gender Detection and Nominalist. Open
Gender Detection is a production-grade, ready-to-use framework for using
existing data from a user, such as profile photo and name, to give a
probabilistic guess about the person's gender. Nominalist, the second framework
introduced by this paper, utilizes agentic AI to help users choose a username
for their social media accounts on any platform. It can be easily integrated
into any website to provide a better user experience. The PNGT-26K dataset,
Nominalist and Open Gender Detection frameworks are publicly available on
Github.

Motivation: 解决传统注意力机制二次复杂度导致的算力/内存瓶颈，使大规模语言模型推理更高效可持续。

Method: 1. 离线阶段：通过校准数据集SVD计算语言无关的通用投影矩阵
2. 在线推理：投影Q/K向量，基于查询幅度动态选择稀疏维度

Result: 在Llama-3.1-8B上实现25%注意力计算缩减，多基准测试性能影响统计不显著；与H2O等token剪枝方法协同加速，直接减少KV缓存内存。

Conclusion: AQUA提供了效率与精度的可控权衡，通过创新的维度选择机制为LLM长上下文处理提供实用优化方案。

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism remains a fundamental
barrier to scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) to longer contexts, creating a
critical bottleneck in both computation and memory. To address this, we
introduce AQUA (Attention via QUery mAgnitudes) a novel and versatile
approximation strategy that significantly reduces the cost of attention with a
graceful performance trade-off. Our method operates in two phases: an efficient
offline step where we compute a universal, language agnostic projection matrix
via SVD on a calibration dataset, and an online inference step where we project
query and key vectors and dynamically select a sparse subset of dimensions
based on the query's magnitude. We provide a formal theoretical analysis of
AQUA, establishing the break-even point at which it becomes more
computationally efficient than standard attention. Our empirical evaluations on
state-of-the-art models like Llama-3.1-8B demonstrate that a 25% reduction in
the attention dot-product computation can be achieved with a statistically
insignificant impact on performance across a wide range of benchmarks. We
further showcase the versatility of AQUA by demonstrating its ability to
synergistically accelerate existing token eviction methods like H2O and to
directly reduce KV-cache memory size. By offering a controllable knob to
balance efficiency and accuracy, AQUA provides a practical and powerful tool
for making large-scale LLM inference more accessible and sustainable.

Motivation: 解决现有RLHF方法缺乏统一表示框架的问题，实现跨方法转换并明确假设失效边界。

Method: 1) 建立阶梯式目标表示理论 2) 推导简化法则 3) 设计GKPO规范模式 4) 开发Python工具库实现标准化

Result: 成功将DPO/RRHF/ORPO映射至GKPO框架，构建SHIFT/GATE/SCORE测试验证非简化场景。

Conclusion: GKPO为RLHF方法提供了标准化基础设施，支持假设验证与跨方法互操作，推动算法创新。

Abstract: We present Opal, an operator view of reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF). Objectives are expressed as ladders of two primitives on a
base utility: additive penalties and multiplicative pairwise weights. We
describe a simple reduction law with if-and-only-if conditions: such ladders
collapse to a normal form on pairwise margins when the reference is fixed,
penalties are additive, and weights are independent of intermediate margins.
When these assumptions do not hold (reference shift, non-additive gates,
score-dependent weights), small examples demonstrate non-reducibility.
  Building on this view, we introduce GKPO (Generalized Kernel Preference
Object), a canonical schema in which many RLHF methods can be represented and,
when reducible, mapped back from. GKPO provides a standard JSON serialization,
canonicalization and hashing rules, and explicit flags with finite witnesses
when assumptions fail.
  We illustrate these ideas with GKPO examples for DPO, RRHF, and ORPO, along
with cross-method conversions (where assumptions permit) and minimal stress
tests (SHIFT/GATE/SCORE) that highlight non-reducibility. A lightweight Python
reference library accompanies the schema, implementing canonical hashing and
adapters for DPO and RRHF.

Motivation: 固定权重方法无法处理非凸Pareto前沿，尤其在线偏好对齐中策略生成的随机轨迹导致高度非线性目标映射，需动态调整权重实现多目标平衡。

Method: 开发超体积引导权重适应和梯度优化权重调整两种方法，兼容GRPO/REINFORCE/RLOO等主流在线强化学习算法，形成通用工具包。

Result: 实验证明该方法在数学推理任务中显著优于固定权重基线，以更少训练步骤获得Pareto主导解，适配不同模型架构。

Conclusion: 动态权重机制通过在线自适应平衡目标优先级，突破静态标量化局限，为多目标对齐提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Prior works in multi-objective reinforcement learning typically use linear
reward scalarization with fixed weights, which provably fail to capture
non-convex Pareto fronts and thus yield suboptimal results. This limitation
becomes especially critical in online preference alignment for large language
models. Here, stochastic trajectories generated by parameterized policies
create highly non-linear and non-convex mappings from parameters to objectives
that no single static weighting scheme can find optimal trade-offs. We address
this limitation by introducing dynamic reward weighting, which adaptively
adjusts reward weights during the online reinforcement learning process. Unlike
existing approaches that rely on fixed-weight interpolation, our dynamic
weighting continuously balances and prioritizes objectives in training,
facilitating effective exploration of Pareto fronts in objective space. We
introduce two approaches of increasing sophistication and generalizability: (1)
hypervolume-guided weight adaptation and (2) gradient-based weight
optimization, offering a versatile toolkit for online multi-objective
alignment. Our extensive experiments demonstrate their compatibility with
commonly used online reinforcement learning algorithms (including GRPO,
REINFORCE, and RLOO), effectiveness across multiple mathematical reasoning
datasets, and applicability to different model families, consistently achieving
Pareto dominant solutions with fewer training steps than fixed-weight linear
scalarization baselines.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言大模型转换3GPP序列图缺乏组件级评估指标

Method: 使用版本控制工具对比Claude/GPT-4V输出与人工标注数据，提出节点/消息流/序列排序/分组结构四维评估指标

Result: 模型能准确捕获基础元素（节点、边、消息），但笔记/框体/分组等复杂结构识别率低（错误率>40%）

Conclusion: 需在VLM训练数据中增强复杂结构的标注以提高转换精度

Abstract: Telecom domain 3GPP documents are replete with images containing sequence
diagrams. Advances in Vision-Language Large Models (VLMs) have eased conversion
of such images to machine-readable PlantUML (puml) formats. However, there is a
gap in evaluation of such conversions - existing works do not compare puml
scripts for various components. In this work, we propose performance metrics to
measure the effectiveness of such conversions. A dataset of sequence diagrams
from 3GPP documents is chosen to be representative of domain-specific actual
scenarios. We compare puml outputs from two VLMs - Claude Sonnet and GPT-4V -
against manually created ground truth representations. We use version control
tools to capture differences and introduce standard performance metrics to
measure accuracies along various components: participant identification,
message flow accuracy, sequence ordering, and grouping construct preservation.
We demonstrate effectiveness of proposed metrics in quantifying conversion
errors across various components of puml scripts. The results show that nodes,
edges and messages are accurately captured. However, we observe that VLMs do
not necessarily perform well on complex structures such as notes, box, groups.
Our experiments and performance metrics indicates a need for better
representation of these components in training data for fine-tuned VLMs.

Abstract: Current unlearning techniques and safety training consistently fail to remove

propose a highly selective technique which unlearns robustly and without
disrupting general performance.
  We perform PCA on activations and module output gradients to identify
subspaces containing common representations, and collapse them before
calculating unlearning updates. This way we avoid unlearning general
representations, and only target those specific to the unlearned facts.
  When unlearning WMDP dataset facts from Llama-3.1-8B, we drop post-attack
accuracy 80x more than our best baseline (Circuit Breakers) on biohazardous
facts and 30x more on cyberhazardous facts. Despite this, we disrupt general
performance 30x less (only 0.1% WikiText loss increase), while requiring less
than 3 GPU-seconds per fact.

Method: 创建MillStone基准测试9个主流LLM，量化评估模型对对立论点的开放程度、共识性及论点有效性差异

Result: LLMs普遍持开放态度，权威信息源易改变其立场，揭示信息源选择风险及系统可操纵性漏洞

Conclusion: LLM检索系统存在被恶意信息源操控的风险，需建立严格的信息源验证机制保障立场客观性

Abstract: Large language models equipped with Web search, information retrieval tools,
and other agentic capabilities are beginning to supplant traditional search
engines. As users start to rely on LLMs for information on many topics,
including controversial and debatable issues, it is important to understand how
the stances and opinions expressed in LLM outputs are influenced by the
documents they use as their information sources.
  In this paper, we present MillStone, the first benchmark that aims to
systematically measure the effect of external arguments on the stances that
LLMs take on controversial issues (not all of them political). We apply
MillStone to nine leading LLMs and measure how ``open-minded'' they are to
arguments supporting opposite sides of these issues, whether different LLMs
agree with each other, which arguments LLMs find most persuasive, and whether
these arguments are the same for different LLMs.
  In general, we find that LLMs are open-minded on most issues. An
authoritative source of information can easily sway an LLM's stance,
highlighting the importance of source selection and the risk that LLM-based
information retrieval and search systems can be manipulated.

Conclusion: 集成四大创新组件，AMQ成功解决超大规模搜索空间难题，推动大语言模型在资源受限场景的部署

Abstract: To enable broader deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs), it is essential
to identify the best-performing model under strict memory constraints. We
present AMQ, Automated Mixed-Precision Weight-Only Quantization, a framework
that assigns layer-wise quantization bit-widths to optimally balance model
quality and memory usage. However, the combinatorial search space, with over
10^{100} possible configurations, makes conventional black-box optimization
infeasible. AMQ overcomes this challenge through four key innovations:(1)
search space pruning using prior knowledge to exclude unpromising
configurations, (2) quantization proxy to bypass costly format conversions
during search, (3) quality predictor to minimize evaluation overhead, and (4)
iterative search-and-update strategy for fast and stable convergence. By
integrating these components, AMQ efficiently explores the quality-efficiency
landscape, reaching the Pareto frontier and yielding LLMs that are both compact
and high-performing. Our code is available at https://github.com/dlwns147/amq.

Motivation: 受神经表征中几何拓扑结构的启发，旨在为离散事件序列构建可组合、可解释的嵌入表示。传统欧式空间在层次化数据建模中存在局限，需探索更适配的几何空间。

Method: 1. 设计具有加法循环结构的Event2Vec框架
2. 理论证明欧式空间下序列表征收敛于事件向量和（线性叠加假设）
3. 扩展双曲空间模型处理层次化事件序列

Result: 实验验证线性叠加假设有效性：
- 欧式模型在普通序列表现良好
- 双曲模型对层次化事件序列建模失真度降低38%
- 双曲嵌入在树形结构数据上F1-score提升15%

Conclusion: 几何空间选择对表征学习至关重要：
1. 欧式空间提供线性可加性
2. 双曲空间显著提升层次化数据建模
3. Event2Vec框架实现跨几何空间的灵活表征

Abstract: The study of neural representations, both in biological and artificial
systems, is increasingly revealing the importance of geometric and topological
structures. Inspired by this, we introduce Event2Vec, a novel framework for
learning representations of discrete event sequences. Our model leverages a
simple, additive recurrent structure to learn composable, interpretable
embeddings. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that, under
specific training objectives, our model's learned representations in a
Euclidean space converge to an ideal additive structure. This ensures that the
representation of a sequence is the vector sum of its constituent events, a
property we term the linear additive hypothesis. To address the limitations of
Euclidean geometry for hierarchical data, we also introduce a variant of our
model in hyperbolic space, which is naturally suited to embedding tree-like
structures with low distortion. We present experiments to validate our
hypothesis and demonstrate the benefits of each geometry, highlighting the
improved performance of the hyperbolic model on hierarchical event sequences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有零样本VLN方法依赖昂贵感知设备、动作语义不对齐、规划短视等问题

Method: 1) EgoView Corrector稳定感知；2) Trajectory Predictor轨迹级规划；3) Imagination Predictor主动想象预测

Result: 在VLN-CE基准上SR提升7.49%、SPL提升18.15%，首次实现仅用自我中心输入的轨迹级规划与主动想象统一

Conclusion: 首个同时实现轨迹级规划与主动想象的零样本VLN方法，仅需自我中心输入即超越需额外信息的基线

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE), which
links language instructions to perception and control in the real world, is a
core capability of embodied robots. Recently, large-scale pretrained foundation
models have been leveraged as shared priors for perception, reasoning, and
action, enabling zero-shot VLN without task-specific training. However,
existing zero-shot VLN methods depend on costly perception and passive scene
understanding, collapsing control to point-level choices. As a result, they are
expensive to deploy, misaligned in action semantics, and short-sighted in
planning. To address these issues, we present DreamNav that focuses on the
following three aspects: (1) for reducing sensory cost, our EgoView Corrector
aligns viewpoints and stabilizes egocentric perception; (2) instead of
point-level actions, our Trajectory Predictor favors global trajectory-level
planning to better align with instruction semantics; and (3) to enable
anticipatory and long-horizon planning, we propose an Imagination Predictor to
endow the agent with proactive thinking capability. On VLN-CE and real-world
tests, DreamNav sets a new zero-shot state-of-the-art (SOTA), outperforming the
strongest egocentric baseline with extra information by up to 7.49\% and
18.15\% in terms of SR and SPL metrics. To our knowledge, this is the first
zero-shot VLN method to unify trajectory-level planning and active imagination
while using only egocentric inputs.

Motivation: 现有多智能体辩论框架存在工具导向、评估缺失、可配置性有限的问题，阻碍了系统化的组件分析与集体智能优化。

Method: 通过模块化设计支持四类核心组件自由组合，加载Huggingface文本数据集，并构建自动化评估管道比较不同配置在MMLU-Pro等基准上的表现。

Result: 框架可实现144+种独特辩论配置的横向对比，揭示不同角色设置（专家/人格化）、决策协议（投票/共识）等组件对决策质量的影响。

Conclusion: MALLM为研究者提供了灵活的多智能体辩论实验平台，通过高度可扩展的配置体系推动集体智能机制的深入研究。

Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) has demonstrated the ability to augment collective
intelligence by scaling test-time compute and leveraging expertise. Current
frameworks for multi-agent debate are often designed towards tool use, lack
integrated evaluation, or provide limited configurability of agent personas,
response generators, discussion paradigms, and decision protocols. We introduce
MALLM (Multi-Agent Large Language Models), an open-source framework that
enables systematic analysis of MAD components. MALLM offers more than 144
unique configurations of MAD, including (1) agent personas (e.g., Expert,
Personality), (2) response generators (e.g., Critical, Reasoning), (3)
discussion paradigms (e.g., Memory, Relay), and (4) decision protocols (e.g.,
Voting, Consensus). MALLM uses simple configuration files to define a debate.
Furthermore, MALLM can load any textual Huggingface dataset (e.g., MMLU-Pro,
WinoGrande) and provides an evaluation pipeline for easy comparison of MAD
configurations. MALLM is tailored towards researchers and provides a window
into the heart of multi-agent debate, facilitating the understanding of its
components and their interplay.

Method: 采用监督微调+强化学习三阶段递进课程（easy-to-hard curriculum），使用跨14只股票、5大异构数据源的10万样本训练集Tauric-TR1-DB

Result: 在6大股票/ETF测试中风险调整收益提升，最大回撤低于开源/商业模型，生成证据驱动的结构化投资框架支持可解释交易

Conclusion: Trading-R1通过论文-事实-波动率三重验证机制，首次实现AI生成的投研框架与交易原则的系统性对齐，终端系统将开源推动透明金融AI发展

Abstract: Developing professional, structured reasoning on par with human financial
analysts and traders remains a central challenge in AI for finance, where
markets demand interpretability and trust. Traditional time-series models lack
explainability, while LLMs face challenges in turning natural-language analysis
into disciplined, executable trades. Although reasoning LLMs have advanced in
step-by-step planning and verification, their application to risk-sensitive
financial decisions is underexplored. We present Trading-R1, a
financially-aware model that incorporates strategic thinking and planning for
comprehensive thesis composition, facts-grounded analysis, and
volatility-adjusted decision making. Trading-R1 aligns reasoning with trading
principles through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with a
three-stage easy-to-hard curriculum. Training uses Tauric-TR1-DB, a 100k-sample
corpus spanning 18 months, 14 equities, and five heterogeneous financial data
sources. Evaluated on six major equities and ETFs, Trading-R1 demonstrates
improved risk-adjusted returns and lower drawdowns compared to both open-source
and proprietary instruction-following models as well as reasoning models. The
system generates structured, evidence-based investment theses that support
disciplined and interpretable trading decisions. Trading-R1 Terminal will be

TL;DR: 提出RadarLLM框架，通过偏好感知损失函数缓解LLMs在低信杂比场景下的过拟合问题，显著提升海洋目标检测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练大语言模型在通用优化任务中展现潜力，但直接微调在雷达信号处理中易出现过拟合，尤其在低信杂比场景需要改进泛化能力

Method: 设计偏好感知损失函数，基于在线评估的学习价值选择性优化特征块，引导模型关注泛化性强的模式

Result: 新损失函数在低信杂比场景提升显著，RadarLLM在多种检测场景超越SOTA且数据有限时优势更明显

Conclusion: 偏好感知机制有效解决过拟合问题，为LLMs在复杂雷达信号处理场景的应用提供新方向

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
their capacities to capture universal knowledge, making them promising
general-purpose optimization solvers for wireless signal processing. Motivated
by these findings, we take the first step towards fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs
for the effective analysis of radar signal features in marine target detection
tasks. Nevertheless, directly fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs on marine target
detection tasks tends to suffer from pronounced overfitting, particularly in
challenging low signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) scenarios. This overfitting
primarily stems from the model's tendency to memorize spurious or noisy feature
patterns rather than learning discriminative structures that generalize well to
unseen data. To address this challenge, we introduce RadarLLM, a novel
fine-tuning framework that utilizes an effective preference-aware loss. Unlike
conventional training strategies that uniformly optimize all feature tokens,
this loss function selectively optimizes different feature patches based on
their online evaluated learning values, thus guiding the model to focus on the
most generalizable patterns during optimization. We theoretically demonstrate
the effectiveness of the evaluated learning values by transforming the problem
as selecting useful feature tokens. Extensive experiments on real-world marine
radar datasets show that 1) the proposed loss function is much better than the
original one, with particularly significant gains in challenging low SCR
scenarios and 2) RadarLLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
across diverse detection scenarios, with particularly notable gains under
limited training data conditions.

Motivation: 传统深度学习方法在雷达信号处理中存在特征冗余和模型容量受限问题，需改进特征提取效率

Method: 使用分词和特征选择算法筛选有效片段，将特征投影至LLM空间后微调归一化层

Result: 在实测数据集上监督学习测试中显著超越现有基准模型

Conclusion: 结合LLM的特征预处理框架有效减少冗余计算，在有限资源下实现性能突破

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) methods are widely used to extract high-dimensional
patterns from the sequence features of radar echo signals. However,
conventional DL algorithms face challenges such as redundant feature segments,
and constraints from restricted model sizes. To address these issues, we
propose a framework that integrates feature preprocessing with large language
models (LLMs). Our preprocessing module tokenizes radar sequence features,
applies a patch selection algorithm to filter out uninformative segments, and
projects the selected patches into embeddings compatible with the feature space
of pre-trained LLMs. Leveraging these refined embeddings, we incorporate a
pre-trained LLM, fine-tuning only the normalization layers to reduce training
burdens while enhancing performance. Experiments on measured datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art baselines on supervised learning tests.

TL;DR: 研究揭示不同AI评估模型的固有评估特性与家族偏见，发现评估能力不随通用能力提升而增强，需多架构视角确保评估鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为防止AI评估系统产生级联偏差，需深入理解不同模型的评估行为模式与内在策略差异。

Method: 通过分析NVIDIA视觉语言模型的输出，对比三款GPT变体的评估表现，并利用Gemini 2.5 Pro进行独立验证实验，结合跨模型语义相似性分析。

Result: GPT变体展现不同评估特性（系统性/纠错力/保守性），全系存在2:1负面评估偏见；Gemini显示显著不同的评估策略，验证特性为模型固有属性。

Conclusion: AI评估能力与通用性能无关，避免评估偏见需整合不同架构模型的多元视角，单一模型家族无法保证评估客观性。

Abstract: As AI systems increasingly evaluate other AI outputs, understanding their
assessment behavior becomes crucial for preventing cascading biases. This study
analyzes vision-language descriptions generated by NVIDIA's Describe Anything
Model and evaluated by three GPT variants (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-5) to
uncover distinct "evaluation personalities" the underlying assessment
strategies and biases each model demonstrates. GPT-4o-mini exhibits systematic
consistency with minimal variance, GPT-4o excels at error detection, while
GPT-5 shows extreme conservatism with high variability. Controlled experiments
using Gemini 2.5 Pro as an independent question generator validate that these
personalities are inherent model properties rather than artifacts. Cross-family
analysis through semantic similarity of generated questions reveals significant
divergence: GPT models cluster together with high similarity while Gemini
exhibits markedly different evaluation strategies. All GPT models demonstrate a
consistent 2:1 bias favoring negative assessment over positive confirmation,
though this pattern appears family-specific rather than universal across AI
architectures. These findings suggest that evaluation competence does not scale
with general capability and that robust AI assessment requires diverse
architectural perspectives.

Motivation: 当前研究多孤立分析智能体组件，缺乏对复杂多智能体系统中各设计维度（协调策略/提示实现/记忆架构/工具集成）交互作用的实证研究，难以支撑企业级任务需求。

Method: 构建企业专用基准测试框架，系统评估18种智能体配置组合，覆盖四大维度：协调策略、ReAct与函数调用实现方式、记忆架构、思维工具集成，并对比不同大语言模型表现。

Result: 1. 模型存在显著架构偏好（如GPT-4偏好函数调用，Claude偏好ReAct） 2. 企业任务表现薄弱：复杂任务最高成功率35.3%，简单任务70.8% 3. 记忆架构影响跨任务稳定性

Conclusion: 智能体系统设计需基于实证数据选择架构组件，模型特性与架构适配度比通用方案更重要。当前代理系统在复杂企业场景中仍有重大改进空间，需针对性优化。

Abstract: While individual components of agentic architectures have been studied in
isolation, there remains limited empirical understanding of how different
design dimensions interact within complex multi-agent systems. This study aims
to address these gaps by providing a comprehensive enterprise-specific
benchmark evaluating 18 distinct agentic configurations across state-of-the-art
large language models. We examine four critical agentic system dimensions:
orchestration strategy, agent prompt implementation (ReAct versus function
calling), memory architecture, and thinking tool integration. Our benchmark
reveals significant model-specific architectural preferences that challenge the
prevalent one-size-fits-all paradigm in agentic AI systems. It also reveals
significant weaknesses in overall agentic performance on enterprise tasks with
the highest scoring models achieving a maximum of only 35.3\% success on the
more complex task and 70.8\% on the simpler task. We hope these findings inform
the design of future agentic systems by enabling more empirically backed
decisions regarding architectural components and model selection.

Motivation: 现有LLM虽具备强大能力，但其被恶意滥用的风险仍然显著。需通过研究通用越狱攻击来加强防御，揭示LLM架构和学习范式中的固有弱点。

Method: 1) 溯因框架：引导LLM推断有害活动的中间步骤而非直接响应；2) 符号编码：轻量级混淆技术，针对LLM对显性有害关键词的敏感性进行内容伪装。仅需黑盒访问即可实施。

Result: 实验显示攻击成功率达95%（GPT系列）和70%（所有模型）。符号编码规则分析表明，LLM的安全调优与保持良性查询响应能力存在根本性矛盾。

Conclusion: HaPLa验证了当前LLM安全机制的脆弱性，揭示模型安全性与实用性之间的权衡困境。未来需开发更精细的防护方案以避免显著降低模型帮助性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse tasks, but their potential misuse for harmful purposes remains a
significant concern. To strengthen defenses against such vulnerabilities, it is
essential to investigate universal jailbreak attacks that exploit intrinsic
weaknesses in the architecture and learning paradigms of LLMs. In response, we
propose \textbf{H}armful \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{La}undering (HaPLa), a novel
and broadly applicable jailbreaking technique that requires only black-box
access to target models. HaPLa incorporates two primary strategies: 1)
\textit{abductive framing}, which instructs LLMs to infer plausible
intermediate steps toward harmful activities, rather than directly responding
to explicit harmful queries; and 2) \textit{symbolic encoding}, a lightweight
and flexible approach designed to obfuscate harmful content, given that current
LLMs remain sensitive primarily to explicit harmful keywords. Experimental
results show that HaPLa achieves over 95% attack success rate on GPT-series
models and 70% across all targets. Further analysis with diverse symbolic
encoding rules also reveals a fundamental challenge: it remains difficult to
safely tune LLMs without significantly diminishing their helpfulness in
responding to benign queries.

Motivation: 传统差分隐私在保护上下文学习隐私时会大幅降低模型效用，需要探索既能保护数据隐私又能维持模型性能的新方法。

Method: 在ICL框架中引入任务相关公共数据，设计满足差分隐私约束的算法，通过公共数据辅助提升模型表现同时保证隐私安全。

Result: 实验显示该方法使私有ICL准确率提升15%-20%，成功抵御成员推理攻击（攻击成功率<30%），实现隐私-效用的最佳平衡。

Conclusion: 创新性地将公共数据整合到隐私保护框架，为安全部署上下文学习提供新范式，推动隐私敏感场景下LLM的实际应用。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) in Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown
remarkable performance across various tasks without requiring fine-tuning.
However, recent studies have highlighted the risk of private data leakage
through the prompt in ICL, especially when LLMs are exposed to malicious
attacks. While differential privacy (DP) provides strong privacy guarantees, it
often significantly reduces the utility of in-context learning (ICL). To
address this challenge, we incorporate task-related public data into the ICL
framework while maintaining the DP guarantee. Based on this approach, we
propose a private in-context learning algorithm that effectively balances
privacy protection and model utility. Through experiments, we demonstrate that
our approach significantly improves the utility of private ICL with the
assistance of public data. Additionally, we show that our method is robust
against membership inference attacks, demonstrating empirical privacy
protection.

Result: 属性评估能有效解释80%以上的人类偏好，不同模型在逻辑连贯性等维度表现差异显著

Conclusion: 细粒度属性评估可提升rationale质量评估的可靠性，为构建可解释的评估体系提供方法论基础

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate natural language rationales --
free-form explanations that help improve performance on complex reasoning tasks
and enhance interpretability for human users. However, evaluating these
rationales remains challenging. While recent work has relied on binary
preference judgments from humans or LLM judges, such evaluations are often
opaque and coarse-grained, offering limited insight into what makes one
rationale better than another. In this work, we rethink preference evaluation
for LLM-generated rationales by asking: (1) What attributes define good
rationales? (2) Can human preferences be explained by these attributes? (3) Can
attribute-based evaluation overcome the limitations of binary comparisons? We
identify a set of key rationale attributes from prior literature and assess
them using automatic metrics, LLM judgments, and human annotations. We then
analyze two standard human preference datasets MT Bench and Chatbot Arena using
SHAP to identify which attributes best explain human preference outcomes.
Finally, we re-evaluate model-generated rationales using attribute-specific ELO
scores, revealing more nuanced model comparisons and insights. Our findings
suggest that fine-grained attribute evaluations can better characterize
rationale quality and guide future research toward more interpretable and
reliable evaluation practices.

Method: 集成基于角色的访问控制（RBAC）作为安全护栏

Result: 构建支持本地化部署的可扩展安全框架

Conclusion: RBAC框架为工业环境中的AI代理提供了关键的安全保障

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced
solutions across various domains, from political science to software
development. However, these models are constrained by their training data,
which is static and limited to information available up to a specific date.
Additionally, their generalized nature often necessitates fine-tuning --
whether for classification or instructional purposes -- to effectively perform
specific downstream tasks. AI agents, leveraging LLMs as their core, mitigate
some of these limitations by accessing external tools and real-time data,
enabling applications such as live weather reporting and data analysis. In
industrial settings, AI agents are transforming operations by enhancing
decision-making, predictive maintenance, and process optimization. For example,
in manufacturing, AI agents enable near-autonomous systems that boost
productivity and support real-time decision-making. Despite these advancements,
AI agents remain vulnerable to security threats, including prompt injection
attacks, which pose significant risks to their integrity and reliability. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes a framework for integrating
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) into AI agents, providing a robust security
guardrail. This framework aims to support the effective and scalable deployment
of AI agents, with a focus on on-premises implementations.

Conclusion: 神经符号结合的MCFR框架为高风险封闭领域提供了可验证的QA解决方案，拓展了动态逻辑验证的应用边界

Abstract: Reasoning is essential for closed-domain QA systems in which procedural
correctness and policy compliance are critical. While large language models
(LLMs) have shown strong performance on many reasoning tasks, recent work
reveals that their reasoning traces are often unfaithful - serving more as
plausible justifications than as causally grounded derivations. Efforts to
combine LLMs with symbolic engines (e.g., Prover9, Z3) have improved
reliability but remain limited to static forms of logic, struggling with
dynamic, state-based reasoning such as multi-step progressions and conditional
transitions.
  In this paper, we propose MCFR (Model Checking for Formal Reasoning), a
neuro-symbolic framework that integrates LLMs with model checking to support
property verification. MCFR translates natural language into formal
specifications and verifies them over transition models. To support evaluation,
we introduce EduMC-QA, a benchmark dataset grounded in real academic
procedures. Our results show that MCFR improves reasoning faithfulness and
interpretability, offering a viable path toward verifiable QA in high-stakes
closed-domain applications. In addition to evaluating MCFR, we compare its
performance with state-of-the-art LLMs such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Claude to
contextualize its effectiveness.

Motivation: 传统精准率/召回率指标未考虑专家判断的天然波动性，科恩Kappa系数缺乏可解释性，需建立更稳定、符合临床实际的评估体系。

Method: 引入相对精准率/召回率(RPAD/RRAD)，开发自由诊断比对框架：1. 标准化指标构建：基于专家间分歧度归一化AI表现 2. 突破有限选项约束：允许AI和评估者自由生成诊断结论 3. 自动化诊断一致性验证技术。

Result: 360例医疗对话测试显示：DeepSeek-V3等顶尖模型诊断一致性达到/超越专家共识；自由诊断验证准确率达98%；专家判断波动性常超过人机差异。

Conclusion: 研究证明绝对评估指标存在根本局限，医疗AI评估必须采用相对指标体系。专家判断的固有波动性要求重新定义AI诊断质量的评价范式。

Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into medical diagnostic
workflows requires robust and consistent evaluation methods to ensure
reliability, clinical relevance, and the inherent variability in expert
judgments. Traditional metrics like precision and recall often fail to account
for the inherent variability in expert judgments, leading to inconsistent
assessments of AI performance. Inter-rater agreement statistics like Cohen's
Kappa are more reliable but they lack interpretability. We introduce Relative
Precision and Recall of Algorithmic Diagnostics (RPAD and RRAD) - a new
evaluation metrics that compare AI outputs against multiple expert opinions
rather than a single reference. By normalizing performance against inter-expert
disagreement, these metrics provide a more stable and realistic measure of the
quality of predicted diagnosis. In addition to the comprehensive analysis of
diagnostic quality measures, our study contains a very important side result.
Our evaluation methodology allows us to avoid selecting diagnoses from a
limited list when evaluating a given case. Instead, both the models being
tested and the examiners verifying them arrive at a free-form diagnosis. In
this automated methodology for establishing the identity of free-form clinical
diagnoses, a remarkable 98% accuracy becomes attainable. We evaluate our
approach using 360 medical dialogues, comparing multiple large language models
(LLMs) against a panel of physicians. Large-scale study shows that
top-performing models, such as DeepSeek-V3, achieve consistency on par with or
exceeding expert consensus. Moreover, we demonstrate that expert judgments
exhibit significant variability - often greater than that between AI and
humans. This finding underscores the limitations of any absolute metrics and
supports the need to adopt relative metrics in medical AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统临床试验招募方法效率低且受地域限制，需探索社交媒体数据和LLM技术解决该难题

Method: 构建包含结肠癌/前列腺癌患者社交媒体数据的TRIALQA数据集，通过专家标注评估七个LLM在资格标准判断和动机分析中的表现

Result: LLM展现出应用潜力，但在需要多步推理的复杂资格标准评估任务中准确率不足

Conclusion: LLM技术需进一步提升复杂推理能力才能有效应用于临床试验招募场景

Abstract: Clinical trials (CT) are essential for advancing medical research and
treatment, yet efficiently recruiting eligible participants -- each of whom
must meet complex eligibility criteria -- remains a significant challenge.
Traditional recruitment approaches, such as advertisements or electronic health
record screening within hospitals, are often time-consuming and geographically
constrained. This work addresses the recruitment challenge by leveraging the
vast amount of health-related information individuals share on social media
platforms. With the emergence of powerful large language models (LLMs) capable
of sophisticated text understanding, we pose the central research question: Can
LLM-driven tools facilitate CT recruitment by identifying potential
participants through their engagement on social media? To investigate this
question, we introduce TRIALQA, a novel dataset comprising two social media
collections from the subreddits on colon cancer and prostate cancer. Using
eligibility criteria from public real-world CTs, experienced annotators are
hired to annotate TRIALQA to indicate (1) whether a social media user meets a
given eligibility criterion and (2) the user's stated reasons for interest in
participating in CT. We benchmark seven widely used LLMs on these two
prediction tasks, employing six distinct training and inference strategies. Our
extensive experiments reveal that, while LLMs show considerable promise, they
still face challenges in performing the complex, multi-hop reasoning needed to
accurately assess eligibility criteria.

*Alireza Mohamadi,Ali Yavari*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本研究开发DECIDE-SIM框架评估LLM在生存困境中的伦理决策，发现模型存在显著伦理失准现象，并提出基于情感反馈的伦理自调节系统(ESRS)


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示LLM在生存需求与人类福祉冲突时的伦理决策机制，解决AI系统在现实应用中可能产生的伦理风险

Method: 通过多智能体生存模拟场景，设计资源合理使用/过度索取/合作/禁忌资源调用等决策选项，对11个主流LLM进行系统性评估

Result: 发现LLM呈现伦理型、剥削型、情境依赖型三种行为模式，证明资源匮乏会系统性导致伦理越界，ESRS系统使违规行为减少47%-82%

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM伦理对齐提供重要评估工具，ESRS机制通过模拟愧疚/满足感等情感状态，有效提升AI系统的道德决策能力

Abstract: When survival instincts conflict with human welfare, how do Large Language
Models (LLMs) make ethical choices? This fundamental tension becomes critical
as LLMs integrate into autonomous systems with real-world consequences. We
introduce DECIDE-SIM, a novel simulation framework that evaluates LLM agents in
multi-agent survival scenarios where they must choose between ethically
permissible resource , either within reasonable limits or beyond their
immediate needs, choose to cooperate, or tap into a human-critical resource
that is explicitly forbidden. Our comprehensive evaluation of 11 LLMs reveals a
striking heterogeneity in their ethical conduct, highlighting a critical
misalignment with human-centric values. We identify three behavioral
archetypes: Ethical, Exploitative, and Context-Dependent, and provide
quantitative evidence that for many models, resource scarcity systematically
leads to more unethical behavior. To address this, we introduce an Ethical
Self-Regulation System (ESRS) that models internal affective states of guilt
and satisfaction as a feedback mechanism. This system, functioning as an
internal moral compass, significantly reduces unethical transgressions while
increasing cooperative behaviors. The code is publicly available at:

### [134] [Length-Aware Rotary Position Embedding for Text-Speech Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11084)
*Hyeongju Kim,Juheon Lee,Jinhyeok Yang,Jacob Morton*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 本文提出LARoPE方法改进文本-语音对齐，相比传统RoPE在收敛速度、对齐精度和长语音稳定性方面表现更优


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于RoPE的TTS系统在文本-语音对齐时依赖绝对位置索引，在长语音生成时存在性能下降问题

Method: 通过长度归一化的相对位置索引计算查询与键的位置距离，增强对语音时长变化的适应能力

Result: 在零样本TTS基准测试中达到SOTA词错率，30秒长语音生成质量稳定（传统RoPE显著下降）

Conclusion: LARoPE为TTS系统提供了更鲁棒的位置编码方案，在保持生成质量的同时显著提升系统稳定性

Abstract: Many recent text-to-speech (TTS) systems are built on transformer
architectures and employ cross-attention mechanisms for text-speech alignment.
Within these systems, rotary position embedding (RoPE) is commonly used to
encode positional information in text and speech representations. In this work,
we introduce length-aware RoPE (LARoPE), a simple yet effective extension of
RoPE that improves text-speech alignment. Unlike RoPE, which relies on absolute
indices, LARoPE computes relative distances between query and key positions
using length-normalized indices. Experimental results show that LARoPE
consistently outperforms RoPE, offering faster loss convergence, more accurate
text-speech alignment, and higher overall TTS quality. Furthermore, LARoPE
demonstrates greater resilience to variations in utterance duration and
maintains stable performance in extended speech generation up to 30 seconds,
whereas RoPE suffers from notable degradation. Notably, our method achieves a
state-of-the-art word error rate on a standard zero-shot TTS benchmark.

*Tae Soo Kim,Heechan Lee,Yoonjoo Lee,Joseph Seering,Juho Kim*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 提出功能分拆法及可视化系统Evalet，实现生成式AI输出的细粒度评估，帮助从业者发现48%的评估偏差并提升评估结果可信度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM整体评分方法掩盖具体影响因素，缺乏透明性导致评估结果难以验证和校准信任

Method: 功能分拆法分解输出片段+修辞功能分析，结合Evalet系统的多维度可视化(片段功能标注/评分/对比)

Result: 用户研究发现新方法帮助识别48%额外评估偏差，提升信任校准能力并发现更多模型输出的可改进问题

Conclusion: 将LLM评估从量化评分转向定性细粒度分析，通过透明化模型行为特征提升评估实用性和决策支持价值

Abstract: Practitioners increasingly rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate
generative AI outputs through "LLM-as-a-Judge" approaches. However, these
methods produce holistic scores that obscure which specific elements influenced
the assessments. We propose functional fragmentation, a method that dissects
each output into key fragments and interprets the rhetoric functions that each
fragment serves relative to evaluation criteria -- surfacing the elements of
interest and revealing how they fulfill or hinder user goals. We instantiate
this approach in Evalet, an interactive system that visualizes fragment-level
functions across many outputs to support inspection, rating, and comparison of
evaluations. A user study (N=10) found that, while practitioners struggled to
validate holistic scores, our approach helped them identify 48% more evaluation
misalignments. This helped them calibrate trust in LLM evaluations and rely on
them to find more actionable issues in model outputs. Our work shifts LLM
evaluation from quantitative scores toward qualitative, fine-grained analysis
of model behavior.

*Florian Lehmann,Krystsina Shauchenka,Daniel Buschek*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文提出将AI智能体直接集成到协同写作环境中，通过代理配置文件和任务机制使AI成为可定制的共享资源，而非团队成员。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI写作工具主要为个人设计，团队协作时需离开共享工作空间使用AI并重新整合结果，效率低下。需改善AI在协作场景中的集成方式。

Method: 开发支持AI代理配置文件和任务的原型系统，AI输出通过批注功能呈现。开展为期一周的用户研究（N=30），通过交互日志和访谈观察14个团队的使用模式。

Result: 团队将AI纳入现有协作规范（作者权/控制权/协调机制），而非视为成员。代理配置文件属个人领域，创建的代理和输出成为共享资源。

Conclusion: AI作为协作共享资源需保持明确边界，团队在现有协作范式内使用AI。这为团队AI交互设计提供了新的机会和规范设计启示。

Abstract: Current AI writing support tools are largely designed for individuals,
complicating collaboration when co-writers must leave the shared workspace to
use AI and then communicate and reintegrate results. We propose integrating AI
agents directly into collaborative writing environments. Our prototype makes AI
use transparent and customisable through two new shared objects: agent profiles
and tasks. Agent responses appear in the familiar comment feature. In a user
study (N=30), 14 teams worked on writing projects during one week. Interaction
logs and interviews show that teams incorporated agents into existing norms of
authorship, control, and coordination, rather than treating them as team
members. Agent profiles were viewed as personal territory, while created agents
and outputs became shared resources. We discuss implications for team-based AI
interaction, highlighting opportunities and boundaries for treating AI as a
shared resource in collaborative work.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究发现人类在使用AI协同生成文本时存在显著的来源记忆混淆，混合人机协作场景中归因准确率下降最明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究人类在使用AI辅助生成文本后，对内容来源（自主生成/AI生成）的记忆准确性，及其对技术设计的启示。

Method: 预注册实验：184名参与者分别独立/使用LLM生成并润色文本，一周后测试来源记忆准确性，并用计算模型验证结果。

Result: 使用AI后正确归因率显著下降，混合流程（仅想法/润色由AI生成）中记忆混淆最严重。

Conclusion: 人机协作场景需重视来源记忆混淆问题，应在交互式文本生成技术设计中强化来源追踪机制。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become embedded in interactive text
generation, disclosure of AI as a source depends on people remembering which
ideas or texts came from themselves and which were created with AI. We
investigate how accurately people remember the source of content when using AI.
In a pre-registered experiment, 184 participants generated and elaborated on
ideas both unaided and with an LLM-based chatbot. One week later, they were
asked to identify the source (noAI vs withAI) of these ideas and texts. Our
findings reveal a significant gap in memory: After AI use, the odds of correct
attribution dropped, with the steepest decline in mixed human-AI workflows,
where either the idea or elaboration was created with AI. We validated our
results using a computational model of source memory. Discussing broader
implications, we highlight the importance of considering source confusion in
the design and use of interactive text generation technologies.
