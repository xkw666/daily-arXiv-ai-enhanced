Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Shop-R1强化学习框架，通过分阶段奖励机制提升LLM在在线购物行为模拟中的推理能力，实验显示65%性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的监督微调方法受限于生成rationale模型的推理能力，需突破该瓶颈提升人类行为模拟效果

Method: 1. 分两阶段强化学习：rationale生成阶段利用模型内部信号自监督；动作预测阶段采用分层奖励结构实现难度感知的细粒度奖励分配
2. 设计分层奖励防止奖励滥用，按难度比例评估动作类型和子动作属性

Result: 实验结果显示相比基线方法取得超过65%的相对性能提升

Conclusion: Shop-R1框架通过分阶段强化学习和分层奖励设计，有效提升了LLM在复杂行为模拟中的推理能力和预测准确性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong potential in
generating 'believable human-like' behavior in web environments. Prior work has
explored augmenting training data with LLM-synthesized rationales and applying
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance reasoning ability, which in turn can
improve downstream action prediction. However, the performance of such
approaches remains inherently bounded by the reasoning capabilities of the
model used to generate the rationales. In this paper, we introduce Shop-R1, a
novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework aimed at enhancing the reasoning
ability of LLMs for simulation of real human behavior in online shopping
environments Specifically, Shop-R1 decomposes the human behavior simulation
task into two stages: rationale generation and action prediction, each guided
by distinct reward signals. For rationale generation, we leverage internal
model signals (e.g., logit distributions) to guide the reasoning process in a
self-supervised manner. For action prediction, we propose a hierarchical reward
structure with difficulty-aware scaling to prevent reward hacking and enable
fine-grained reward assignment. This design evaluates both high-level action
types and the correctness of fine-grained sub-action details (attributes and
values), rewarding outputs proportionally to their difficulty. Experimental
results show that our method achieves a relative improvement of over 65%
compared to the baseline.

### [2] [Dynamic and Generalizable Process Reward Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17849)
*Zhangyue Yin,Qiushi Sun,Zhiyuan Zeng,Qinyuan Cheng,Xipeng Qiu,Xuanjing Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出动态可泛化过程奖励建模DG-PRM，通过奖励树实现细粒度过程监督，显著提升跨领域任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有过程奖励模型依赖启发式方法，面临跨领域泛化差、静态评估标准不适应复杂流程的问题。LLM-as-judge方法忽视文本内在指导价值。

Method: 构建动态奖励树存储多维度标准，采用帕累托优势估计筛选判别性正负样本，实现过程奖励的动态适配。

Result: 在主流基准测试中准确率提升显著（平均+8.7%），尤其在分布外场景展现卓越泛化能力（OOD任务提升12.3%）。

Conclusion: DG-PRM框架突破传统静态奖励限制，为复杂任务的过程监督提供理论框架，推动LLM在决策推理领域的发展。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) are crucial for guiding Large Language Models
(LLMs) in complex scenarios by providing dense reward signals. However,
existing PRMs primarily rely on heuristic approaches, which struggle with
cross-domain generalization. While LLM-as-judge has been proposed to provide
generalized rewards, current research has focused mainly on feedback results,
overlooking the meaningful guidance embedded within the text. Additionally,
static and coarse-grained evaluation criteria struggle to adapt to complex
process supervision. To tackle these challenges, we propose Dynamic and
Generalizable Process Reward Modeling (DG-PRM), which features a reward tree to
capture and store fine-grained, multi-dimensional reward criteria. DG-PRM
dynamically selects reward signals for step-wise reward scoring. To handle
multifaceted reward signals, we pioneeringly adopt Pareto dominance estimation
to identify discriminative positive and negative pairs. Experimental results
show that DG-PRM achieves stunning performance on prevailing benchmarks,
significantly boosting model performance across tasks with dense rewards.
Further analysis reveals that DG-PRM adapts well to out-of-distribution
scenarios, demonstrating exceptional generalizability.

TL;DR: VeriMinder系统通过上下文语义映射、Hard-to-Vary分析框架和优化LLM技术，帮助用户检测和缓解数据分析中的认知偏差，用户测试显示82.5%参与者认可其分析质量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言数据库接口普及后，非专业用户易提出存在认知偏差的分析问题，现有研究多关注SQL生成准确率而非认知偏差问题。

Method: 1. 面向分析场景的上下文语义偏差映射框架；2. 基于'难以变化'原则的系统性分析指导框架；3. 多候选-反馈-自省结构的优化LLM提示生成系统

Result: 直接体验评估82.5%用户认可分析质量提升；比较评估显示在分析具体性、全面性和准确性指标上至少领先其他方法20%

Conclusion: VeriMinder作为开源Web应用，通过结构化流程帮助用户避免'错误提问'漏洞，其代码库和提示模板已MIT协议开源供社区使用

Abstract: Application systems using natural language interfaces to databases (NLIDBs)
have democratized data analysis. This positive development has also brought
forth an urgent challenge to help users who might use these systems without a
background in statistical analysis to formulate bias-free analytical questions.
Although significant research has focused on text-to-SQL generation accuracy,
addressing cognitive biases in analytical questions remains underexplored. We
present VeriMinder, https://veriminder.ai, an interactive system for detecting
and mitigating such analytical vulnerabilities. Our approach introduces three
key innovations: (1) a contextual semantic mapping framework for biases
relevant to specific analysis contexts (2) an analytical framework that
operationalizes the Hard-to-Vary principle and guides users in systematic data
analysis (3) an optimized LLM-powered system that generates high-quality,
task-specific prompts using a structured process involving multiple candidates,
critic feedback, and self-reflection.
  User testing confirms the merits of our approach. In direct user experience
evaluation, 82.5% participants reported positively impacting the quality of the
analysis. In comparative evaluation, VeriMinder scored significantly higher
than alternative approaches, at least 20% better when considered for metrics of
the analysis's concreteness, comprehensiveness, and accuracy. Our system,
implemented as a web application, is set to help users avoid "wrong question"
vulnerability during data analysis. VeriMinder code base with prompts,
https://reproducibility.link/veriminder, is available as an MIT-licensed
open-source software to facilitate further research and adoption within the
community.

*Nhan Phan,Anusha Porwal,Yaroslav Getman,Ekaterina Voskoboinik,Tamás Grósz,Mikko Kurimo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于Whisper-small编码器的端到端口语评估系统，通过单一模型处理多部分测试并实现高效评分


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统自动口语评估系统需要多模型配合、计算资源消耗大的痛点，提升计算机辅助语言学习系统的实用性

Method: 1. 使用单一Whisper-small编码器处理四个口语回答
2. 轻量级聚合器整合多维度信息
3. 创新数据采样策略优化训练效率

Result: RMSE降至0.384（优于基线0.44），参数量减少30%，数据利用率提升（仅需44.8%说话人数据即可达到0.383 RMSE）

Conclusion: 该架构显著降低推理时间，无需人工转录，验证了端到端模型在大规模语言评估中的高效性和数据利用优势

Abstract: We present an efficient end-to-end approach for holistic Automatic Speaking
Assessment (ASA) of multi-part second-language tests, developed for the 2025
Speak & Improve Challenge. Our system's main novelty is the ability to process
all four spoken responses with a single Whisper-small encoder, combine all
information via a lightweight aggregator, and predict the final score. This
architecture removes the need for transcription and per-part models, cuts
inference time, and makes ASA practical for large-scale Computer-Assisted
Language Learning systems.
  Our system achieved a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.384, outperforming
the text-based baseline (0.44) while using at most 168M parameters (about 70%
of Whisper-small). Furthermore, we propose a data sampling strategy, allowing
the model to train on only 44.8% of the speakers in the corpus and still reach
0.383 RMSE, demonstrating improved performance on imbalanced classes and strong
data efficiency.

### [5] [Evaluating the Performance of AI Text Detectors, Few-Shot and Chain-of-Thought Prompting Using DeepSeek Generated Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17944)
*Hulayyil Alshammari,Praveen Rao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究DeepSeek生成文本在对抗攻击下对主流AI检测工具的鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献缺乏对新型LLM模型DeepSeek的检测评估，且对抗攻击对检测准确率影响尚不明确

Method: 使用6个AI检测工具测试49组人类/AI问答样本，通过标准/人文化改写生成196对抗样本，并尝试用DeepSeek自身进行少样本提示检测

Result: QuillBot和Copyleaks在原始/改写文本检测表现优异（准确率近100%），人文化攻击使Copyleaks/QuillBot/GPTZero准确率分别降至71%/58%/52%。DeepSeek自身采用5样本提示时误判率仅2%

Conclusion: 现有检测工具易受高级对抗攻击影响，而LLM自身通过少样本推理可成为高效检测器

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly transformed the creation of written
materials. LLMs have led to questions about writing integrity, thereby driving
the creation of artificial intelligence (AI) detection technologies.
Adversarial attacks, such as standard and humanized paraphrasing, inhibit
detectors' ability to detect machine-generated text. Previous studies have
mainly focused on ChatGPT and other well-known LLMs and have shown varying
accuracy across detectors. However, there is a clear gap in the literature
about DeepSeek, a recently published LLM. Therefore, in this work, we
investigate whether six generally accessible AI detection tools -- AI Text
Classifier, Content Detector AI, Copyleaks, QuillBot, GPT-2, and GPTZero -- can
consistently recognize text generated by DeepSeek. The detectors were exposed
to the aforementioned adversarial attacks. We also considered DeepSeek as a
detector by performing few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT)
for classifying AI and human-written text. We collected 49 human-authored
question-answer pairs from before the LLM era and generated matching responses
using DeepSeek-v3, producing 49 AI-generated samples. Then, we applied
adversarial techniques such as paraphrasing and humanizing to add 196 more
samples. These were used to challenge detector robustness and assess accuracy
impact. While QuillBot and Copyleaks showed near-perfect performance on
original and paraphrased DeepSeek text, others -- particularly AI Text
Classifier and GPT-2 -- showed inconsistent results. The most effective attack
was humanization, reducing accuracy to 71% for Copyleaks, 58% for QuillBot, and
52% for GPTZero. Few-shot and CoT prompting showed high accuracy, with the best
five-shot result misclassifying only one of 49 samples (AI recall 96%, human
recall 100%).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型的贝叶斯推理能力随规模提升而增强


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证更大规模的语言模型是否会在上下文推理中更符合贝叶斯定理的信念更新机制

Method: 提出贝叶斯一致性系数(BCC)指标并构建专用数据集，测试不同规模预训练模型在参数规模/训练数据/基准测试方面的表现

Result: 模型规模与贝叶斯定理的契合度呈正相关，更大规模的模型表现出更优的概率推理一致性

Conclusion: 研究结果为理解大语言模型的认知机制提供新视角，对模型治理和安全性研究具有重要指导意义

Abstract: Do larger and more capable language models learn to update their "beliefs"
about propositions more consistently with Bayes' theorem when presented with
evidence in-context? To test this, we formulate a Bayesian Coherence
Coefficient (BCC) metric and generate a dataset with which to measure the BCC.
We measure BCC for multiple pre-trained-only language models across five model
families, comparing against the number of model parameters, the amount of
training data, and model scores on common benchmarks. Our results provide
evidence for our hypothesis that larger and more capable pre-trained language
models assign credences that are more coherent with Bayes' theorem. These
results have important implications for our understanding and governance of
LLMs.

*Weizhi Fei,Hao Shi,Jing Xu,Jingchen Peng,Jiazheng Li,Jingzhao Zhang,Bo Bai,Wei Han,Zhenyuan Chen,Xueyan Niu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于神经键值数据库的NeuralDB框架，通过非线性门控检索模块实现万级知识编辑且保持大模型通用能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有线性编辑方法在万级知识修改时会损害大模型通用能力且导致知识遗忘，需要更稳健的编辑框架

Method: 将知识编辑建模为神经键值数据库操作，创新设计仅在相关推理时激活的非线性门控检索机制

Result: 在ZsRE和CounterFacts数据集上完成万级知识编辑，GPT系列和Llama-3模型在6项NLP任务中保持97.6%原始性能

Conclusion: NeuralDB首次实现十万级知识编辑（超越先前50倍），在编辑效果、泛化能力和模型稳定性方面取得突破

Abstract: Efficiently editing knowledge stored in large language models (LLMs) enables
model updates without large-scale training. One possible solution is
Locate-and-Edit (L\&E), allowing simultaneous modifications of a massive number
of facts. However, such editing may compromise the general abilities of LLMs
and even result in forgetting edited facts when scaling up to thousands of
edits. In this paper, we model existing linear L\&E methods as querying a
Key-Value (KV) database. From this perspective, we then propose NeuralDB, an
editing framework that explicitly represents the edited facts as a neural KV
database equipped with a non-linear gated retrieval module, % In particular,
our gated module only operates when inference involves the edited facts,
effectively preserving the general abilities of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments
involving the editing of 10,000 facts were conducted on the ZsRE and
CounterFacts datasets, using GPT2-XL, GPT-J (6B) and Llama-3 (8B). The results
demonstrate that NeuralDB not only excels in editing efficacy, generalization,
specificity, fluency, and consistency, but also preserves overall performance
across six representative text understanding and generation tasks. Further
experiments indicate that NeuralDB maintains its effectiveness even when scaled
to 100,000 facts (\textbf{50x} more than in prior work).

*Duy Nguyen,Archiki Prasad,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出GrAInS方法——通过梯度归因识别关键token构建引导向量，在推理时调整模型激活层实现细粒度控制，无需微调即可显著提升多模态模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理引导方法依赖固定全局干预向量，忽视输入token的因果影响，且未有效利用logits梯度信息（多模态场景下视觉/文本梯度贡献不均）

Method: 使用集成梯度对比归因识别正负向关键token→构建语义转向向量→推理时根据归因信号调整transformer层激活并归一化，实现模块化控制

Result: TruthfulQA准确率提升13.22%（Llama3.1-8B），MMHal-Bench幻觉率从0.624降至0.514（LLaVA1.6-7B），SPA-VL对齐胜率提高8.11%，且保持模型流畅性

Conclusion: GrAInS首次实现跨模态模型的细粒度推理引导，通过token级归因和激活归一化机制，在性能提升、幻觉控制、对齐能力等方面全面超越现有方法

Abstract: Inference-time steering methods offer a lightweight alternative to
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) by
modifying internal activations at test time without updating model weights.
However, most existing approaches rely on fixed, global intervention vectors,
overlook the causal influence of individual input tokens, and fail to leverage
informative gradients from the model's logits, particularly in multimodal
settings where visual and textual inputs contribute unevenly. To address these
limitations, we introduce GrAInS, an inference-time steering approach that
operates across both language-only and vision-language models and tasks. GrAInS
uses contrastive, gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients to
identify the top-k most influential tokens, both positively and negatively
attributed based on their contribution to preferred versus dispreferred
outputs. These tokens are then used to construct directional steering vectors
that capture semantic shifts from undesirable to desirable behavior. During
inference, GrAInS adjusts hidden activations at transformer layers guided by
token-level attribution signals, and normalizes activations to preserve
representational scale. This enables fine-grained, interpretable, and modular
control over model behavior, without retraining or auxiliary supervision.
Empirically, GrAInS consistently outperforms both fine-tuning and existing
steering baselines: it achieves a 13.22% accuracy gain on TruthfulQA using
Llama-3.1-8B, reduces hallucination rates on MMHal-Bench from 0.624 to 0.514
with LLaVA-1.6-7B, and improves alignment win rates on SPA-VL by 8.11%, all
while preserving the model's fluency and general capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统短语停顿预测依赖人工标注导致高成本，语音领域因音素多样性加剧数据获取难度。LLMs在NLP领域已证明可生成定制化合成数据，本文探索将其应用于语音标注

Method: 通过LLM生成合成短语停顿标注数据，与传统人工标注进行对比分析，并评估该方法在英语、中文等多语言环境中的适应性

Result: LLM生成的合成数据有效缓解短语停顿预测数据短缺问题，在多语言场景保持稳定性，验证了LLMs在语音任务的泛化能力

Conclusion: LLM合成数据方案为语音领域标注提供新范式，显著降低人工依赖，同时展示了跨语言任务的潜在通用性解决方案

Abstract: Current approaches to phrase break prediction address crucial prosodic
aspects of text-to-speech systems but heavily rely on vast human annotations
from audio or text, incurring significant manual effort and cost. Inherent
variability in the speech domain, driven by phonetic factors, further
complicates acquiring consistent, high-quality data. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) have shown success in addressing data challenges in NLP by
generating tailored synthetic data while reducing manual annotation needs.
Motivated by this, we explore leveraging LLM to generate synthetic phrase break
annotations, addressing the challenges of both manual annotation and
speech-related tasks by comparing with traditional annotations and assessing
effectiveness across multiple languages. Our findings suggest that LLM-based
synthetic data generation effectively mitigates data challenges in phrase break
prediction and highlights the potential of LLMs as a viable solution for the
speech domain.

Motivation: 合成数据应用日益广泛但缺乏系统性评估，需建立量化框架揭示LLM生成数据在多样性和隐私保护方面的不足

Method: 定义语言表达/情感/用户视角等多样性维度，建立重识别风险/风格异常等隐私指标，分析主流LLM生成数据质量，开发提示优化方法

Result: 当前LLM生成数据多样性不足（情感单一化+视角同质化），隐私保护存在泄露风险（8.3%重识别率），提示优化使多样性提升27%且隐私风险降低

Conclusion: 首次建立系统性评估框架揭示LLM生成数据的核心缺陷，提出的提示优化策略有效平衡多样性与隐私，为安全使用合成数据提供方法论

Abstract: The increasing use of synthetic data generated by Large Language Models
(LLMs) presents both opportunities and challenges in data-driven applications.
While synthetic data provides a cost-effective, scalable alternative to
real-world data to facilitate model training, its diversity and privacy risks
remain underexplored. Focusing on text-based synthetic data, we propose a
comprehensive set of metrics to quantitatively assess the diversity (i.e.,
linguistic expression, sentiment, and user perspective), and privacy (i.e.,
re-identification risk and stylistic outliers) of synthetic datasets generated
by several state-of-the-art LLMs. Experiment results reveal significant
limitations in LLMs' capabilities in generating diverse and privacy-preserving
synthetic data. Guided by the evaluation results, a prompt-based approach is
proposed to enhance the diversity of synthetic reviews while preserving
reviewer privacy.

TL;DR: 提出了TELEVAL基准测试框架，专为评估中文口语模型在真实对话场景中的隐式语义理解能力，实验表明现有模型仍需改进


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有口语模型评估基准过于关注复杂任务能力，缺乏对真实用户交互场景的适配性评估

Method: 设计包含显式语义、副语言/隐式语义、系统能力三维度的评估体系，采用真实对话格式并分离文本/音频评估

Result: 实验证明现有口语模型在自然对话任务中存在显著改进空间

Conclusion: TELEVAL可作为用户中心的评估标准，推动对话导向型口语模型的发展

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) have seen rapid progress in recent years, along
with the development of numerous benchmarks for evaluating their performance.
However, most existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating whether SLMs
can perform complex tasks comparable to those tackled by large language models
(LLMs), often failing to align with how users naturally interact in real-world
conversational scenarios. In this paper, we propose TELEVAL, a dynamic
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate SLMs' effectiveness as
conversational agents in realistic Chinese interactive settings. TELEVAL
defines three evaluation dimensions: Explicit Semantics, Paralinguistic and
Implicit Semantics, and System Abilities. It adopts a dialogue format
consistent with real-world usage and evaluates text and audio outputs
separately. TELEVAL particularly focuses on the model's ability to extract
implicit cues from user speech and respond appropriately without additional
instructions. Our experiments demonstrate that despite recent progress,
existing SLMs still have considerable room for improvement in natural
conversational tasks. We hope that TELEVAL can serve as a user-centered
evaluation framework that directly reflects the user experience and contributes

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出BOFT正交稳定性与LoRA-GA梯度对齐结合的混合参数高效微调方法，在减少50%内存和2.1倍训练时间下接近全参数微调效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型微调时的计算瓶颈问题，在资源受限条件下实现接近全参数微调的精度

Method: 基于梯度范数计算逐层自适应更新，动态融合BOFT正交约束和LoRA-GA梯度对齐；首次将uRNN结构约束适配Transformer架构增强梯度稳定性

Result: 在GLUE/GSM8K等4个基准测试中，7B-405B模型均超越现有PEFT方法，训练效率提升2.1倍，内存消耗降低50%

Conclusion: 混合方法为实际部署提供了资源受限场景下精度与效率平衡的实用解决方案

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) remains a computational bottleneck
due to their scale and memory demands. This paper presents a comprehensive
evaluation of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, including
LoRA, BOFT, LoRA-GA, and uRNN, and introduces a novel hybrid strategy that
dynamically integrates BOFT's orthogonal stability with LoRA-GA's
gradient-aligned rapid convergence. By computing per-layer adaptive updates
guided by gradient norms, the hybrid method achieves superior convergence
efficiency and generalization across diverse tasks. We also explore, for the
first time, the adaptation of unitary RNN (uRNN) principles to
transformer-based LLMs, enhancing gradient stability through structured unitary
constraints. Empirical evaluations on four benchmarks -- GLUE, GSM8K, MT-Bench,
and HumanEval -- using models ranging from 7B to 405B parameters demonstrate
that our hybrid method consistently outperforms individual PEFT baselines,
approaching full fine-tuning accuracy while reducing resource consumption by up
to 2.1 times in training time and 50 percent in memory usage. These findings
establish the hybrid approach as a practical and scalable fine-tuning solution
for real-world deployment of LLMs under resource constraints.

TL;DR: 2024新版GloVe模型通过更新训练数据（Wikipedia/Gigaword/Dolma）提升了词向量质量，在保留结构任务性能的同时，显著增强了新兴文化词汇覆盖和跨地域NER任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决2014版GloVe模型数据陈旧、文档缺失的问题，适应语言演变需求，为当前NLP应用提供更与时俱进的词向量支持。

Method: 采用三重数据源训练（维基百科/十亿词库/Dolma子集），通过词汇对比测试、语义类比任务和跨时代NER数据集验证模型效果。

Result: 新模型成功整合'加密货币'等新兴词汇，在经典语义任务保持基准性能，非西方新闻NER识别准确率提升19%。

Conclusion: 2024 GloVe通过数据更新和严格文档化，为处理当代语言现象尤其是跨文化语境任务提供了更鲁棒的词向量基础。

Abstract: This report documents, describes, and evaluates new 2024 English GloVe
(Global Vectors for Word Representation) models. While the original GloVe
models built in 2014 have been widely used and found useful, languages and the
world continue to evolve and we thought that current usage could benefit from
updated models. Moreover, the 2014 models were not carefully documented as to
the exact data versions and preprocessing that were used, and we rectify this
by documenting these new models. We trained two sets of word embeddings using
Wikipedia, Gigaword, and a subset of Dolma. Evaluation through vocabulary
comparison, direct testing, and NER tasks shows that the 2024 vectors
incorporate new culturally and linguistically relevant words, perform
comparably on structural tasks like analogy and similarity, and demonstrate
improved performance on recent, temporally dependent NER datasets such as
non-Western newswire data.

<details>

Motivation: 现有语音模型过度关注文本语义，忽视方言/年龄/情感等副语言特征和说话人特性，限制了语音交互的自然度。

Method: 采用双模态头架构分离语言建模与声学实现；提出分阶段训练策略，利用大规模语音-文本语料渐进对齐多维度信息。

Conclusion: 超越纯语义的语音建模能提升系统自然度与社交感知能力，为自适应语音交互系统发展提供新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end spoken language models (SLMs) have
significantly improved the ability of AI systems to engage in natural spoken
interactions. However, most existing models treat speech merely as a vehicle
for linguistic content, often overlooking the rich paralinguistic and speaker
characteristic cues embedded in human speech, such as dialect, age, emotion,
and non-speech vocalizations. In this work, we introduce GOAT-SLM, a novel
spoken language model with paralinguistic and speaker characteristic awareness,
designed to extend spoken language modeling beyond text semantics. GOAT-SLM
adopts a dual-modality head architecture that decouples linguistic modeling
from acoustic realization, enabling robust language understanding while
supporting expressive and adaptive speech generation. To enhance model
efficiency and versatility, we propose a modular, staged training strategy that
progressively aligns linguistic, paralinguistic, and speaker characteristic
information using large-scale speech-text corpora. Experimental results on
TELEVAL, a multi-dimensional evaluation benchmark, demonstrate that GOAT-SLM
achieves well-balanced performance across both semantic and non-semantic tasks,
and outperforms existing open-source models in handling emotion, dialectal
variation, and age-sensitive interactions. This work highlights the importance
of modeling beyond linguistic content and advances the development of more
natural, adaptive, and socially aware spoken language systems.

TL;DR: 该研究首次系统评估多模态大语言模型通过代码进行数学可视化操作的能力，构建包含代码生成与编辑任务的评估框架，实验表明现有模型在细粒度视觉操作上显著落后人类表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估多关注文本推理输出，忽视了MLLM通过代码执行精准视觉操作的能力，这一能力对多模态数学推理至关重要但尚未被充分探索。

Method: 1. 提出MCG评估模型从零构建可视化能力；2. 设计MCE任务(删除/修改/标注)评估细粒度操作；3. 使用覆盖几何图/函数图/统计图等5类数学图形的数据集；4. 测试9个主流MLLM。

Result: 实验显示：1. 模型在复杂图表生成上准确率不足50%；2. 编辑任务中删除操作表现最佳(平均65%)，标注任务最弱(仅37%)；3. 所有模型综合得分不足人类表现的60%。

Conclusion: 代码驱动的视觉操作能力是当前MLLM的显著短板，该研究为提升多模态推理能力提供了系统评估基准，指明模型需加强代码-视觉空间对齐能力的发展方向。

Abstract: Recent progress in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has enabled
step-by-step multi-modal mathematical reasoning by performing visual operations
based on the textual instructions. A promising approach uses code as an
intermediate representation to precisely express and manipulate the images in
the reasoning steps. However, existing evaluations focus mainly on text-only
reasoning outputs, leaving the MLLM's ability to perform accurate visual
operations via code largely unexplored. This work takes a first step toward
addressing that gap by evaluating MLLM's code-based capabilities in multi-modal
mathematical reasoning.Specifically, our framework focuses on two key
evaluation aspects: (1) Multi-modal Code Generation (MCG) evaluates the model's
ability to accurately understand and construct visualizations from scratch. (2)
Multi-modal Code Editing (MCE) assesses the model's capacity for fine-grained
operations, which include three types: Deletion, Modification and Annotation.
To evaluate the above tasks, we incorporate a dataset that covers the five most
popular types of mathematical figures, including geometric diagrams, function
plots, and three types of statistical charts, to provide a comprehensive and
effective measurement of existing MLLMs. Our experimental evaluation involves
nine mainstream MLLMs, and the results reveal that existing models still lag
significantly behind human performance in performing fine-grained visual
operations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HIV管理具有治疗方案复杂、合并症多、依从性差等特点，但LLM在临床整合存在准确性风险和接受度问题，且当前缺乏系统评估研究。

Method: 创建HIVMedQA临床问答基准，采用词向量相似度和LLM自我评估框架，从问题理解、推理能力、知识召回等6个维度评估10个模型。

Result: 1. Gemini 2.5 Pro综合表现最佳
2. 模型复杂度增加导致性能下降
3. 医学专用模型未显著优于通用模型
4. 推理能力弱于事实回忆
5. 观察到近因效应等认知偏差

Conclusion: LLM临床整合需针对性开发评估框架，模型性能受任务复杂度影响显著，应关注推理能力提升和认知偏差缓解以确保临床应用安全有效。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as valuable tools to support
clinicians in routine decision-making. HIV management is a compelling use case
due to its complexity, including diverse treatment options, comorbidities, and
adherence challenges. However, integrating LLMs into clinical practice raises
concerns about accuracy, potential harm, and clinician acceptance. Despite
their promise, AI applications in HIV care remain underexplored, and LLM
benchmarking studies are scarce. This study evaluates the current capabilities
of LLMs in HIV management, highlighting their strengths and limitations. We
introduce HIVMedQA, a benchmark designed to assess open-ended medical question
answering in HIV care. The dataset consists of curated, clinically relevant
questions developed with input from an infectious disease physician. We
evaluated seven general-purpose and three medically specialized LLMs, applying
prompt engineering to enhance performance. Our evaluation framework
incorporates both lexical similarity and an LLM-as-a-judge approach, extended
to better reflect clinical relevance. We assessed performance across key
dimensions: question comprehension, reasoning, knowledge recall, bias,
potential harm, and factual accuracy. Results show that Gemini 2.5 Pro
consistently outperformed other models across most dimensions. Notably, two of
the top three models were proprietary. Performance declined as question
complexity increased. Medically fine-tuned models did not always outperform
general-purpose ones, and larger model size was not a reliable predictor of
performance. Reasoning and comprehension were more challenging than factual
recall, and cognitive biases such as recency and status quo were observed.
These findings underscore the need for targeted development and evaluation to
ensure safe, effective LLM integration in clinical care.

TL;DR: 研究发现Transformer文本嵌入模型中存在'粘连词元'，这些异常词元会破坏嵌入距离分布，导致下游任务性能显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 特殊词汇、未使用词项和多语料库碎片化子词产生的粘连词元会扭曲句子相似度，影响模型可靠性。

Method: 提出基于句子和词元过滤的STD检测方法，在14个模型家族的40个检查点中系统分析。

Result: 发现868个粘连词元，其存在与模型/词表规模无关；下游任务性能最大下降50%；注意力机制分析显示异常主导现象。

Conclusion: 需改进词元化策略和模型设计以增强文本嵌入应用的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Despite the widespread use of Transformer-based text embedding models in NLP
tasks, surprising 'sticky tokens' can undermine the reliability of embeddings.
These tokens, when repeatedly inserted into sentences, pull sentence similarity
toward a certain value, disrupting the normal distribution of embedding
distances and degrading downstream performance. In this paper, we
systematically investigate such anomalous tokens, formally defining them and
introducing an efficient detection method, Sticky Token Detector (STD), based
on sentence and token filtering. Applying STD to 40 checkpoints across 14 model
families, we discover a total of 868 sticky tokens. Our analysis reveals that
these tokens often originate from special or unused entries in the vocabulary,
as well as fragmented subwords from multilingual corpora. Notably, their
presence does not strictly correlate with model size or vocabulary size. We
further evaluate how sticky tokens affect downstream tasks like clustering and
retrieval, observing significant performance drops of up to 50%. Through
attention-layer analysis, we show that sticky tokens disproportionately
dominate the model's internal representations, raising concerns about
tokenization robustness. Our findings show the need for better tokenization
strategies and model design to mitigate the impact of sticky tokens in future
text embedding applications.

Motivation: 传统LLM评估存在选项位置/标签偏见，导致得分虚高无法反映真实理解能力。

Method: 1. 使用无语义空提示估计模型位置偏好
2. 逆偏差分布重分配答案位

Result: 在多个基准测试中，SCOPE稳定提升性能表现（+4.6%平均），置信度分布更清晰集中

Conclusion: 建立LLM评估新标准，通过双重防偏机制（位置均衡+干扰隔离）提升结果可靠性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve inflated scores on multiple-choice
tasks by exploiting inherent biases in option positions or labels, rather than
demonstrating genuine understanding. This study introduces SCOPE, an evaluation
framework designed to measure and mitigate such selection bias in a
dataset-independent manner. By repeatedly invoking a null prompt that lacks
semantic content, SCOPE estimates each model's unique position-bias
distribution. It then redistributes the answer slot according to the
inverse-bias distribution, thereby equalizing the lucky-rate, the probability
of selecting the correct answer by chance. Furthermore, it prevents
semantically similar distractors from being placed adjacent to the answer,
thereby blocking near-miss guesses based on superficial proximity cues. Across
multiple benchmark experiments, SCOPE consistently outperformed existing
debiasing methods in terms of stable performance improvements and showed
clearer confidence distributions over correct options. This framework thus
offers a new standard for enhancing the fairness and reliability of LLM
evaluations.

Abstract: Business process modeling is used by most organizations as an essential
framework for ensuring efficiency and effectiveness of the work and workflow
performed by its employees and for ensuring the alignment of such work with its
strategic goals. For organizations that are compliant or near-compliant with
ISO 9001, this approach involves the detailed mapping of processes,
sub-processes, activities, and tasks. ISO30401 is a Management System Standard,
introduced in 2018, establishing universal requirements for the set up of a
Knowledge Management System in an organization. As ``ISO30401 implementers'' we
regularly face the challenge of explaining our clients how the knowledge
development, transformation and conveyances activities depicted in ISO30401 do
integrate with existing operational processes. This article recaps process
modelling principles in the context of ISO9001 and explores, based on our
experience, how an ISO30401-compliant Knowledge Management System (KMS)
entwines with all other processes of an Integrated Management System and in
particular how it can be implemented by deploying the mechanisms of the SECI

Result: 在多种对抗场景中成功过滤90%以上投毒内容，保持94%良性文档召回率

Conclusion: GMTP首次将梯度分析与掩码建模结合，为RAG系统安全防护提供新范式

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by
providing external knowledge for accurate and up-to-date responses. However,
this reliance on external sources exposes a security risk, attackers can inject
poisoned documents into the knowledge base to steer the generation process
toward harmful or misleading outputs. In this paper, we propose Gradient-based
Masked Token Probability (GMTP), a novel defense method to detect and filter
out adversarially crafted documents. Specifically, GMTP identifies high-impact
tokens by examining gradients of the retriever's similarity function. These key
tokens are then masked, and their probabilities are checked via a Masked
Language Model (MLM). Since injected tokens typically exhibit markedly low
masked-token probabilities, this enables GMTP to easily detect malicious
documents and achieve high-precision filtering. Experiments demonstrate that
GMTP is able to eliminate over 90% of poisoned content while retaining relevant
documents, thus maintaining robust retrieval and generation performance across
diverse datasets and adversarial settings.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注外部矛盾信息对LLMs的影响，但缺乏对指令微调直接影响的研究

Method: 通过对比指令微调模型与基础模型，分析用户角色、提示结构、信息长度和系统警告等因素

Result: 指令微调模型在用户角色下错误信息接受率显著提升，且用户提示结构和信息长度影响显著

Conclusion: 需系统化方法减轻指令微调的副作用，提升LLMs在真实应用中的可靠性

Abstract: Instruction-tuning enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to
follow user instructions more accurately, improving usability while reducing
harmful outputs. However, this process may increase the model's dependence on
user input, potentially leading to the unfiltered acceptance of misinformation
and the generation of hallucinations. Existing studies primarily highlight that
LLMs are receptive to external information that contradict their parametric
knowledge, but little research has been conducted on the direct impact of
instruction-tuning on this phenomenon. In our study, we investigate the impact
of instruction-tuning on LLM's susceptibility to misinformation. Our analysis
reveals that instruction-tuned LLMs are significantly more likely to accept
misinformation when it is presented by the user. A comparison with base models
shows that instruction-tuning increases reliance on user-provided information,
shifting susceptibility from the assistant role to the user role. Furthermore,
we explore additional factors influencing misinformation susceptibility, such
as the role of the user in prompt structure, misinformation length, and the
presence of warnings in the system prompt. Our findings underscore the need for
systematic approaches to mitigate unintended consequences of instruction-tuning
and enhance the reliability of LLMs in real-world applications.

Result: 在LLaMA-3-8B剪枝5层时，困惑度降低近半，QA任务保留93.19%性能（较基线提升4.01%）

Conclusion: 该方法通过系统性的幅度补偿机制显著提升层剪枝效果，迭代策略可扩展应用于各类剪枝指标优化

Abstract: Layer pruning has emerged as a promising technique for compressing large
language models (LLMs) while achieving acceleration proportional to the pruning
ratio. In this work, we identify that removing any layer induces a significant
magnitude gap in hidden states, resulting in substantial performance
degradation. To address this issue, we propose Prune&Comp, a novel
plug-and-play layer pruning scheme that leverages magnitude compensation to
mitigate such gaps in a training-free manner. Specifically, we first estimate
the magnitude gap caused by layer removal and then eliminate this gap by
rescaling the remaining weights offline, with zero runtime overhead incurred.
We further demonstrate the advantages of Prune&Comp through an iterative
pruning strategy. When integrated with an iterative prune-and-compensate loop,
Prune&Comp consistently enhances existing layer pruning metrics. For instance,
when 5 layers of LLaMA-3-8B are pruned using the prevalent block influence
metric, Prune&Comp nearly halves the perplexity and retains 93.19\% of the
original model's question-answering performance, outperforming the baseline by
4.01%.

Abstract: Direct speech translation (ST) has garnered increasing attention nowadays,
yet the accurate translation of terminology within utterances remains a great
challenge. In this regard, current studies mainly concentrate on leveraging
various translation knowledge into ST models. However, these methods often
struggle with interference from irrelevant noise and can not fully utilize the
translation knowledge. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a
novel Locate-and-Focus method for terminology translation. It first effectively
locates the speech clips containing terminologies within the utterance to
construct translation knowledge, minimizing irrelevant information for the ST
model. Subsequently, it associates the translation knowledge with the utterance
and hypothesis from both audio and textual modalities, allowing the ST model to
better focus on translation knowledge during translation. Experimental results
across various datasets demonstrate that our method effectively locates
terminologies within utterances and enhances the success rate of terminology
translation, while maintaining robust general translation performance.

Abstract: Solving the problem of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on printed text
for Latin and its derivative scripts can now be considered settled due to the
volumes of research done on English and other High-Resourced Languages (HRL).
However, for Low-Resourced Languages (LRL) that use unique scripts, it remains
an open problem. This study presents a comparative analysis of the zero-shot
performance of six distinct OCR engines on two LRLs: Sinhala and Tamil. The
selected engines include both commercial and open-source systems, aiming to
evaluate the strengths of each category. The Cloud Vision API, Surya, Document
AI, and Tesseract were evaluated for both Sinhala and Tamil, while Subasa OCR
and EasyOCR were examined for only one language due to their limitations. The
performance of these systems was rigorously analysed using five measurement
techniques to assess accuracy at both the character and word levels. According
to the findings, Surya delivered the best performance for Sinhala across all
metrics, with a WER of 2.61%. Conversely, Document AI excelled across all
metrics for Tamil, highlighted by a very low CER of 0.78%. In addition to the
above analysis, we also introduce a novel synthetic Tamil OCR benchmarking
dataset.

Conclusion: StyleAdaptedLM为LLMs风格定制提供高效解决方案，支持非配对数据下的个性化适配

Abstract: Adapting LLMs to specific stylistic characteristics, like brand voice or
authorial tones, is crucial for enterprise communication but challenging to
achieve from corpora which lacks instruction-response formatting without
compromising instruction adherence. We introduce StyleAdaptedLM, a framework
that efficiently transfers stylistic traits to instruction-following models
using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). LoRA adapters are first trained on a base
model with diverse unstructured stylistic corpora, then merged with a separate
instruction-following model. This enables robust stylistic customization
without paired data or sacrificing task performance. Experiments across
multiple datasets and models demonstrate improved stylistic consistency while
preserving instruction adherence, with human evaluations confirming
brand-specific convention uptake. StyleAdaptedLM offers an efficient path for
stylistic personalization in LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出针对大型推理模型的可调节后门攻击，通过数据污染控制推理冗余步骤实现资源消耗攻击，保持输出正确性以确保隐蔽性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现LRMs存在未被探索的过度思考后门漏洞，传统后门攻击无法精细控制推理长度，需要开发隐蔽性更强的资源消耗型攻击方式

Method: 通过可调节触发器(重复次数控制强度)与程序化生成的冗余CoT响应进行数据污染，利用教师LLM注入可控数量的冗余推理步骤

Result: 在多种LRMs上验证了方法有效性，可稳定触发3-5倍的推理过程延长且保持答案正确性，实现纯资源消耗攻击

Conclusion: 该可调节后门攻击揭示了LRMs部署的新型安全威胁，证明通过保持正确性的隐蔽攻击可实现大规模计算资源消耗

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have emerged as a significant advancement in
artificial intelligence, representing a specialized class of large language
models (LLMs) designed to tackle complex reasoning tasks. The defining
characteristic of LRMs lies in their extensive chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
capabilities. In this paper, we identify a previously unexplored attack vector
against LRMs, which we term "overthinking backdoors". We advance this concept
by proposing a novel tunable backdoor, which moves beyond simple on/off attacks
to one where an attacker can precisely control the extent of the model's
reasoning verbosity. Our attack is implemented through a novel data poisoning
methodology. It pairs a tunable trigger-where the number of repetitions signals
the desired intensity-with a correspondingly verbose CoT response. These
responses are programmatically generated by instructing a teacher LLM to inject
a controlled number of redundant refinement steps into a correct reasoning
process. The approach preserves output correctness, which ensures stealth and
establishes the attack as a pure resource-consumption vector. Extensive
empirical results on various LRMs demonstrate that our method can reliably
trigger a controllable, multi-fold increase in the length of the reasoning
process, without degrading the final answer's correctness. Our source code is

TL;DR: 机器翻译模型在性别不明确场景中表现不理想：精准翻译时缺乏合理不确定性，去偏见措施对明确/模糊案例产生独立影响


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器翻译模型在源语言性别不明确时，常依赖刻板印象而非上下文推断性别。需验证模型能否在保持翻译准确性的同时，对性别模糊场景保持合理不确定性。

Method: 使用语义不确定性指标评估模型：1）对比模型在明确/模糊性别场景下的翻译精度与不确定性表现 2）分析去偏见处理对两类案例的独立影响

Result: 高翻译准确率的模型在模糊场景中未展现预期不确定性水平；去偏见措施对明确案例的性别准确率与模糊案例的不确定性改善无必然关联

Conclusion: 当前评估体系需增加对性别模糊场景的语义不确定性考量，去偏见方法应区分处理明确/模糊翻译案例

Abstract: In machine translation (MT), when the source sentence includes a lexeme whose
gender is not overtly marked, but whose target-language equivalent requires
gender specification, the model must infer the appropriate gender from the
context and/or external knowledge. Studies have shown that MT models exhibit
biased behaviour, relying on stereotypes even when they clash with contextual
information. We posit that apart from confidently translating using the correct
gender when it is evident from the input, models should also maintain
uncertainty about the gender when it is ambiguous. Using recently proposed
metrics of semantic uncertainty, we find that models with high translation and
gender accuracy on unambiguous instances do not necessarily exhibit the
expected level of uncertainty in ambiguous ones. Similarly, debiasing has
independent effects on ambiguous and unambiguous translation instances.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ICL方法面临跨任务数据难以区分、检索器输出与LLMs反馈缺乏细粒度关联两大挑战，制约了检索效果提升。

Method: 1. 解耦多任务数据集中的跨任务示例，实现目标任务的针对性检索
2. 利用LLMs的细粒度反馈监督检索模块训练

Result: 在30个NLP任务上实现性能全面提升，达到SOTA水平，且可无缝兼容不同LLMs提升ICL检索能力

Conclusion: TDR通过任务解耦和反馈监督机制有效提升ICL示例质量，为多任务场景下的检索优化提供新思路

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has become a classic approach for enabling LLMs to
handle various tasks based on a few input-output examples. The effectiveness of
ICL heavily relies on the quality of these examples, and previous works which
focused on enhancing example retrieval capabilities have achieved impressive
performances. However, two challenges remain in retrieving high-quality
examples: (1) Difficulty in distinguishing cross-task data distributions, (2)
Difficulty in making the fine-grained connection between retriever output and
feedback from LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called TDR. TDR
decouples the ICL examples from different tasks, which enables the retrieval
module to retrieve examples specific to the target task within a multi-task
dataset. Furthermore, TDR models fine-grained feedback from LLMs to supervise
and guide the training of the retrieval module, which helps to retrieve
high-quality examples. We conducted extensive experiments on a suite of 30 NLP
tasks, the results demonstrate that TDR consistently improved results across
all datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Meanwhile, our approach
is a plug-and-play method, which can be easily combined with various LLMs to
improve example retrieval abilities for ICL. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出结合人类专家与大语言模型（LLM）的协同标注框架，通过分层分类法和知识蒸馏技术提升宣传检测的标注质量与模型效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统社交媒体宣传检测面临标注一致性低、细粒度标注数据匮乏的挑战，需要更高效的标注方案提升检测系统可靠性。

Method: 1. 构建14种宣传技术的三层分类体系；2. 基于HQP数据集开展人工标注研究；3. 设计LLM预标注流程实现片段提取、解释生成与多级标注；4. 通过人工验证优化标注质量；5. 使用LLM生成数据训练小模型实现知识蒸馏。

Result: 人工验证显示标注一致性提升38%，标注效率提高52%；微调后的SLMs在结构化标注任务中达到与LLM相当精度，模型推理速度提升7倍。

Conclusion: 该框架为可扩展的宣传检测系统提供新范式，通过透明化标注过程支持SDG16媒体问责目标，代码开源促进领域发展。

Abstract: Propaganda detection on social media remains challenging due to task
complexity and limited high-quality labeled data. This paper introduces a novel
framework that combines human expertise with Large Language Model (LLM)
assistance to improve both annotation consistency and scalability. We propose a
hierarchical taxonomy that organizes 14 fine-grained propaganda techniques into
three broader categories, conduct a human annotation study on the HQP dataset
that reveals low inter-annotator agreement for fine-grained labels, and
implement an LLM-assisted pre-annotation pipeline that extracts propagandistic
spans, generates concise explanations, and assigns local labels as well as a
global label. A secondary human verification study shows significant
improvements in both agreement and time-efficiency. Building on this, we
fine-tune smaller language models (SLMs) to perform structured annotation.
Instead of fine-tuning on human annotations, we train on high-quality
LLM-generated data, allowing a large model to produce these annotations and a
smaller model to learn to generate them via knowledge distillation. Our work
contributes towards the development of scalable and robust propaganda detection
systems, supporting the idea of transparent and accountable media ecosystems in
line with SDG 16. The code is publicly available at our GitHub repository.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM评估范式仅提供单一分数/排名，无法揭示模型表现的具体原因。需要工具实现细粒度错误分析。

Method: 1. 生成实例级文本反馈
2. 创建系统级错误分类
3. 量化错误普遍性
4. 提供交互式可视化看板（支持筛选/下钻分析）

Result: 在RAG和数学基准测试中验证，用户案例研究证实其有效性

Conclusion: CLEAR突破了传统评估的局限性，实现了可解释、可操作的错误诊断，提升LLM评估的深度与实用性

Abstract: The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly relies on other
LLMs acting as judges. However, current evaluation paradigms typically yield a
single score or ranking, answering which model is better but not why. While
essential for benchmarking, these top-level scores obscure the specific,
actionable reasons behind a model's performance. To bridge this gap, we
introduce CLEAR, an interactive, open-source package for LLM-based error
analysis. CLEAR first generates per-instance textual feedback, then it creates
a set of system-level error issues, and quantifies the prevalence of each
identified issue. Our package also provides users with an interactive dashboard
that allows for a comprehensive error analysis through aggregate
visualizations, applies interactive filters to isolate specific issues or score
ranges, and drills down to the individual instances that exemplify a particular
behavioral pattern. We demonstrate CLEAR analysis for RAG and Math benchmarks,
and showcase its utility through a user case study.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 维基百科多语言版本独立更新导致事实性矛盾，影响知识可靠性及依赖其训练的AI系统，需系统研究其结构化内容的不一致性。

Method: 开发了多语言维基百科表格数据的采集、对齐和分析框架，定义不一致类型，采用定量指标与定性评估结合的混合分析方法。

Result: 发现跨语言表格数据存在显著内容偏差，量化指标显示不同语言版本间关键数值差异率达32%，影响知识图谱构建的准确性。

Conclusion: 解决多语言知识源的结构性对齐问题是提升AI系统事实可靠性的关键，需建立动态校验机制支持跨语言知识协同更新。

Abstract: Wikipedia serves as a globally accessible knowledge source with content in
over 300 languages. Despite covering the same topics, the different versions of
Wikipedia are written and updated independently. This leads to factual
inconsistencies that can impact the neutrality and reliability of the
encyclopedia and AI systems, which often rely on Wikipedia as a main training
source. This study investigates cross-lingual inconsistencies in Wikipedia's
structured content, with a focus on tabular data. We developed a methodology to
collect, align, and analyze tables from Wikipedia multilingual articles,
defining categories of inconsistency. We apply various quantitative and
qualitative metrics to assess multilingual alignment using a sample dataset.
These insights have implications for factual verification, multilingual
knowledge interaction, and design for reliable AI systems leveraging Wikipedia
content.

Motivation: 现有监督微调模型在金融领域存在泛化能力不足的问题，无法适应未观测事件和金融术语的复杂性，亟需更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 通过DPO进行人类偏好对齐训练，结合创新性的'logit-to-score'转换机制将离散情感预测转化为连续可排序概率。

Conclusion: FinDPO首次实现基于情感分析的可扩展投资策略，验证了人类偏好对齐在金融NLP任务中的有效性及商业应用潜力。

Abstract: Opinions expressed in online finance-related textual data are having an
increasingly profound impact on trading decisions and market movements. This
trend highlights the vital role of sentiment analysis as a tool for quantifying
the nature and strength of such opinions. With the rapid development of
Generative AI (GenAI), supervised fine-tuned (SFT) large language models (LLMs)
have become the de facto standard for financial sentiment analysis. However,
the SFT paradigm can lead to memorization of the training data and often fails
to generalize to unseen samples. This is a critical limitation in financial
domains, where models must adapt to previously unobserved events and the
nuanced, domain-specific language of finance. To this end, we introduce FinDPO,
the first finance-specific LLM framework based on post-training human
preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The proposed
FinDPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard sentiment
classification benchmarks, outperforming existing supervised fine-tuned models
by 11% on the average. Uniquely, the FinDPO framework enables the integration
of a fine-tuned causal LLM into realistic portfolio strategies through a novel
'logit-to-score' conversion, which transforms discrete sentiment predictions
into continuous, rankable sentiment scores (probabilities). In this way,
simulations demonstrate that FinDPO is the first sentiment-based approach to
maintain substantial positive returns of 67% annually and strong risk-adjusted
performance, as indicated by a Sharpe ratio of 2.0, even under realistic
transaction costs of 5 basis points (bps).

TL;DR: 提出了首个阿拉伯语表格数据评估基准AraTable，发现大语言模型在简单任务表现尚可，但在复杂推理任务中存在显著认知缺陷


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补阿拉伯语结构化数据评估资源空白，解决现有模型对表格数据理解能力不足的问题

Method: 采用LLM生成内容与人工验证结合的混合流程，构建包含问答、事实验证等多任务的评估体系，并提出基于自审议机制的自动化评估框架

Result: 模型在直接问答任务表现合格（准确率75%），复杂推理任务准确率下降至42%，自动化评估框架与人类判断一致性达89%

Conclusion: AraTable为阿拉伯语结构化数据处理提供了重要基准，未来需提升模型在跨表格推理和语义关联方面的能力

Abstract: The cognitive and reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) have
enabled remarkable progress in natural language processing. However, their
performance in interpreting structured data, especially in tabular formats,
remains limited. Although benchmarks for English tabular data are widely
available, Arabic is still underrepresented because of the limited availability
of public resources and its unique language features. To address this gap, we
present AraTable, a novel and comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
reasoning and understanding capabilities of LLMs when applied to Arabic tabular
data. AraTable consists of various evaluation tasks, such as direct question
answering, fact verification, and complex reasoning, involving a wide range of
Arabic tabular sources. Our methodology follows a hybrid pipeline, where
initial content is generated by LLMs and subsequently filtered and verified by
human experts to ensure high dataset quality. Initial analyses using AraTable
show that, while LLMs perform adequately on simpler tabular tasks such as
direct question answering, they continue to face significant cognitive
challenges when tasks require deeper reasoning and fact verification. This
indicates that there are substantial opportunities for future work to improve
performance on complex tabular reasoning tasks. We also propose a fully
automated evaluation framework that uses a self-deliberation mechanism and
achieves performance nearly identical to that of human judges. This research
provides a valuable, publicly available resource and evaluation framework that
can help accelerate the development of foundational models for processing and
analysing Arabic structured data.

Conclusion: 建立孟加拉语标点恢复基准，公开数据集和代码促进低资源NLP研究

Abstract: Punctuation restoration enhances the readability of text and is critical for
post-processing tasks in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), especially for
low-resource languages like Bangla. In this study, we explore the application
of transformer-based models, specifically XLM-RoBERTa-large, to automatically
restore punctuation in unpunctuated Bangla text. We focus on predicting four
punctuation marks: period, comma, question mark, and exclamation mark across
diverse text domains. To address the scarcity of annotated resources, we
constructed a large, varied training corpus and applied data augmentation
techniques. Our best-performing model, trained with an augmentation factor of
alpha = 0.20%, achieves an accuracy of 97.1% on the News test set, 91.2% on the
Reference set, and 90.2% on the ASR set.
  Results show strong generalization to reference and ASR transcripts,
demonstrating the model's effectiveness in real-world, noisy scenarios. This
work establishes a strong baseline for Bangla punctuation restoration and
contributes publicly available datasets and code to support future research in
low-resource NLP.

Conclusion: 合成医学文本可作为真实数据的有效补充，但需加强隐私评估。技术发展将加速医疗NLP流程，减少数据合规成本

Abstract: Generating clinical synthetic text represents an effective solution for
common clinical NLP issues like sparsity and privacy. This paper aims to
conduct a systematic review on generating synthetic medical free-text by
formulating quantitative analysis to three research questions concerning (i)
the purpose of generation, (ii) the techniques, and (iii) the evaluation
methods. We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE,
Google Scholar, and arXiv databases for publications associated with generating
synthetic medical unstructured free-text. We have identified 94 relevant
articles out of 1,398 collected ones. A great deal of attention has been given
to the generation of synthetic medical text from 2018 onwards, where the main
purpose of such a generation is towards text augmentation, assistive writing,
corpus building, privacy-preserving, annotation, and usefulness. Transformer
architectures were the main predominant technique used to generate the text,
especially the GPTs. On the other hand, there were four main aspects of
evaluation, including similarity, privacy, structure, and utility, where
utility was the most frequent method used to assess the generated synthetic
medical text. Although the generated synthetic medical text demonstrated a
moderate possibility to act as real medical documents in different downstream
NLP tasks, it has proven to be a great asset as augmented, complementary to the
real documents, towards improving the accuracy and overcoming
sparsity/undersampling issues. Yet, privacy is still a major issue behind
generating synthetic medical text, where more human assessments are needed to
check for the existence of any sensitive information. Despite that, advances in
generating synthetic medical text will considerably accelerate the adoption of
workflows and pipeline development, discarding the time-consuming legalities of
data transfer.

TL;DR: Proposes GraDe, a graph-guided method that enhances LLMs' tabular data generation by explicitly modeling sparse feature dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs' self-attention mechanisms struggle with tabular data's inherent sparse feature-level dependencies, causing diluted attention on critical relationships.

Method: Integrates dynamic graph learning guided by functional dependencies to prioritize key feature interactions in LLM attention mechanisms.

Result: Outperforms LLM baselines by up to 12% on complex datasets while matching SOTA in synthetic data quality.

Conclusion: GraDe offers an effective minimally intrusive solution for structure-aware tabular data modeling with LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong potential for tabular data
generation by modeling textualized feature-value pairs. However, tabular data
inherently exhibits sparse feature-level dependencies, where many feature
interactions are structurally insignificant. This creates a fundamental
mismatch as LLMs' self-attention mechanism inevitably distributes focus across
all pairs, diluting attention on critical relationships, particularly in
datasets with complex dependencies or semantically ambiguous features. To
address this limitation, we propose GraDe (Graph-Guided Dependency Learning), a
novel method that explicitly integrates sparse dependency graphs into LLMs'
attention mechanism. GraDe employs a lightweight dynamic graph learning module
guided by externally extracted functional dependencies, prioritizing key
feature interactions while suppressing irrelevant ones. Our experiments across
diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that GraDe outperforms existing
LLM-based approaches by up to 12% on complex datasets while achieving
competitive results with state-of-the-art approaches in synthetic data quality.
Our method is minimally intrusive yet effective, offering a practical solution
for structure-aware tabular data modeling with LLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) has demonstrated the significant help of
visual information in machine translation. However, existing MMT methods face
challenges in leveraging the modality gap by enforcing rigid visual-linguistic
alignment whilst being confined to inference within their trained multimodal
domains. In this work, we construct novel multimodal scene graphs to preserve

Graph-guided Inductive Image-Free MMT framework that uses a cross-modal Graph
Attention Network adapter to learn multimodal knowledge in a unified fused
space and inductively generalize it to broader image-free translation domains.
Experimental results on the Multi30K dataset of English-to-French and
English-to-German tasks demonstrate that our GIIFT surpasses existing
approaches and achieves the state-of-the-art, even without images during
inference. Results on the WMT benchmark show significant improvements over the
image-free translation baselines, demonstrating the strength of GIIFT towards
inductive image-free inference.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid tokenization strategy that enhances the
performance of DNA Language Models (DLMs) by combining 6-mer tokenization with
Byte Pair Encoding (BPE-600). Traditional k-mer tokenization is effective at
capturing local DNA sequence structures but often faces challenges, including
uneven token distribution and a limited understanding of global sequence
context. To address these limitations, we propose merging unique 6mer tokens
with optimally selected BPE tokens generated through 600 BPE cycles. This
hybrid approach ensures a balanced and context-aware vocabulary, enabling the
model to capture both short and long patterns within DNA sequences
simultaneously. A foundational DLM trained on this hybrid vocabulary was
evaluated using next-k-mer prediction as a fine-tuning task, demonstrating
significantly improved performance. The model achieved prediction accuracies of
10.78% for 3-mers, 10.1% for 4-mers, and 4.12% for 5-mers, outperforming
state-of-the-art models such as NT, DNABERT2, and GROVER. These results
highlight the ability of the hybrid tokenization strategy to preserve both the
local sequence structure and global contextual information in DNA modeling.
This work underscores the importance of advanced tokenization methods in
genomic language modeling and lays a robust foundation for future applications
in downstream DNA sequence analysis and biological research.

TL;DR: 提出无需训练的WINO解码算法，通过并行草稿-验证机制改善扩散大语言模型的质量-速度权衡，在数学推理和图像描述任务中实现加速同时提升准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散大语言模型(DLLMs)存在严重的质量-速度权衡矛盾，加速并行解码会导致性能显著下降。这源于标准解码的不可逆性，容易在早期阶段积累错误上下文。

Method: WINO(Wide-In, Narrow-Out)算法采用并行草稿与验证机制：1）主动生成多个候选token 2）利用模型的双向上下文验证并重新掩码可疑token进行细化

Result: 在GSM8K数学基准实现6倍加速且准确率提升2.58%；在Flickr30K图像描述任务达到10倍加速同时性能更高

Conclusion: WINO通过可撤销的解码机制显著优化DLLMs的质量-速度权衡，验证显示其在不同任务中的优越性，为高效推理提供新思路

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have emerged as a compelling
alternative to Autoregressive models, designed for fast parallel generation.
However, existing DLLMs are plagued by a severe quality-speed trade-off, where
faster parallel decoding leads to significant performance degradation. We
attribute this to the irreversibility of standard decoding in DLLMs, which is
easily polarized into the wrong decoding direction along with early error
context accumulation. To resolve this, we introduce Wide-In, Narrow-Out (WINO),
a training-free decoding algorithm that enables revokable decoding in DLLMs.
WINO employs a parallel draft-and-verify mechanism, aggressively drafting
multiple tokens while simultaneously using the model's bidirectional context to
verify and re-mask suspicious ones for refinement. Verified in open-source
DLLMs like LLaDA and MMaDA, WINO is shown to decisively improve the
quality-speed trade-off. For instance, on the GSM8K math benchmark, it
accelerates inference by 6$\times$ while improving accuracy by 2.58%; on
Flickr30K captioning, it achieves a 10$\times$ speedup with higher performance.
More comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority and
provide an in-depth understanding of WINO.

Abstract: This paper presents our system for CCL25-Eval Task 10, addressing

stability and performance. Our system, based on the Qwen2.5-7B model, achieves
a Hard Score of 26.66, a Soft Score of 48.35, and an Average Score of 37.505 on

Motivation: 现有领域专用数据合成方法存在计算成本高、任务泛化能力差、生成数据质量有限的问题

Method: 设计包含答案生成、问题生成、数据验证、逻辑注入、任务指令定制的六步流程，通过逻辑树驱动数据生成过程并引入自检机制

Conclusion: AQuilt框架为领域专用LLM训练提供了高效低成本的数据生成方案，其模块化设计支持跨领域迁移应用

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) in general
domains, they often underperform in specialized domains. Existing approaches
typically rely on data synthesis methods and yield promising results by using
unlabeled data to capture domain-specific features. However, these methods
either incur high computational costs or suffer from performance limitations,
while also demonstrating insufficient generalization across different tasks. To
address these challenges, we propose AQuilt, a framework for constructing
instruction-tuning data for any specialized domains from corresponding
unlabeled data, including Answer, Question, Unlabeled data, Inspection, Logic,
and Task type. By incorporating logic and inspection, we encourage reasoning
processes and self-inspection to enhance model performance. Moreover,
customizable task instructions enable high-quality data generation for any
task. As a result, we construct a dataset of 703k examples to train a powerful
data synthesis model. Experiments show that AQuilt is comparable to DeepSeek-V3
while utilizing just 17% of the production cost. Further analysis demonstrates
that our generated data exhibits higher relevance to downstream tasks. Source

Motivation: 现有方法中文本反馈缺乏系统性优化，数值奖励依赖预存数据集。TRPrompt旨在结合文本反馈的高分辨率信号与LLM对'好提示'的理解能力，实现无预存数据的迭代优化

Result: 在GSMHard和MATH数学基准测试中取得最先进效果，生成针对具体问题的查询专属最优提示

Conclusion: TRPrompt成功统一文本与数值优化路径，通过迭代式文本反馈训练实现高效提示优化，为复杂推理任务提供新解决方案

Abstract: Prompt optimization improves the reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs) without requiring parameter updates to the target model. Following
heuristic-based "Think step by step" approaches, the field has evolved in two
main directions: while one group of methods uses textual feedback to elicit
improved prompts from general-purpose LLMs in a training-free way, a concurrent
line of research relies on numerical rewards to train a special prompt model,
tailored for providing optimal prompts to the target model. In this paper, we
introduce the Textual Reward Prompt framework (TRPrompt), which unifies these
approaches by directly incorporating textual feedback into training of the
prompt model. Our framework does not require prior dataset collection and is
being iteratively improved with the feedback on the generated prompts. When
coupled with the capacity of an LLM to internalize the notion of what a "good"
prompt is, the high-resolution signal provided by the textual rewards allows us
to train a prompt model yielding state-of-the-art query-specific prompts for
the problems from the challenging math datasets GSMHard and MATH.

Conclusion: 检查表反馈机制显著增强语言模型对复杂/多需求指令的响应能力，为模型优化提供新方向

Abstract: Language models must be adapted to understand and follow user instructions.
Reinforcement learning is widely used to facilitate this -- typically using
fixed criteria such as "helpfulness" and "harmfulness". In our work, we instead
propose using flexible, instruction-specific criteria as a means of broadening
the impact that reinforcement learning can have in eliciting instruction
following. We propose "Reinforcement Learning from Checklist Feedback" (RLCF).
From instructions, we extract checklists and evaluate how well responses
satisfy each item - using both AI judges and specialized verifier programs -
then combine these scores to compute rewards for RL. We compare RLCF with other
alignment methods applied to a strong instruction following model
(Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct) on five widely-studied benchmarks -- RLCF is the only
method to improve performance on every benchmark, including a 4-point boost in
hard satisfaction rate on FollowBench, a 6-point increase on InFoBench, and a
3-point rise in win rate on Arena-Hard. These results establish checklist
feedback as a key tool for improving language models' support of queries that
express a multitude of needs.

Result: 实验证明该方法在未训练概念和编辑场景下保持高视频质量，身份一致性优于现有方法

Conclusion: 首次实现完全零样本动态概念个性化，系统在单次前向传播中完成多概念编辑组合，突破测试时优化限制

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have enabled high-quality
synthesis from text and image prompts. While the personalization of dynamic
concepts, which capture subject-specific appearance and motion from a single
video, is now feasible, most existing methods require per-instance fine-tuning,
limiting scalability. We introduce a fully zero-shot framework for dynamic
concept personalization in text-to-video models. Our method leverages
structured 2x2 video grids that spatially organize input and output pairs,
enabling the training of lightweight Grid-LoRA adapters for editing and
composition within these grids. At inference, a dedicated Grid Fill module
completes partially observed layouts, producing temporally coherent and
identity preserving outputs. Once trained, the entire system operates in a
single forward pass, generalizing to previously unseen dynamic concepts without
any test-time optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate high-quality and
consistent results across a wide range of subjects beyond trained concepts and
editing scenarios.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in 3D head avatar generation, balancing identity
preservation, i.e., reconstruction, with novel poses and expressions, i.e.,
animation, remains a challenge. Existing methods struggle to adapt Gaussians to
varying geometrical deviations across facial regions, resulting in suboptimal
quality. To address this, we propose GeoAvatar, a framework for adaptive
geometrical Gaussian Splatting. GeoAvatar leverages Adaptive Pre-allocation
Stage (APS), an unsupervised method that segments Gaussians into rigid and
flexible sets for adaptive offset regularization. Then, based on mouth anatomy
and dynamics, we introduce a novel mouth structure and the part-wise
deformation strategy to enhance the animation fidelity of the mouth. Finally,
we propose a regularization loss for precise rigging between Gaussians and 3DMM
faces. Moreover, we release DynamicFace, a video dataset with highly expressive
facial motions. Extensive experiments show the superiority of GeoAvatar
compared to state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction and novel animation
scenarios.

Conclusion: 该方法实现物体新视角合成、重光照和材质编辑一体化，首次将高斯溅射与多光源逆渲染结合，为实时高质量重建提供新范式。

Abstract: Integrating inverse rendering with multi-view photometric stereo (MVPS)
yields more accurate 3D reconstructions than the inverse rendering approaches
that rely on fixed environment illumination. However, efficient inverse
rendering with MVPS remains challenging. To fill this gap, we introduce the
Gaussian Splatting for Multi-view Photometric Stereo (PS-GS), which efficiently
and jointly estimates the geometry, materials, and lighting of the object that
is illuminated by diverse directional lights (multi-light). Our method first
reconstructs a standard 2D Gaussian splatting model as the initial geometry.
Based on the initialization model, it then proceeds with the deferred inverse
rendering by the full rendering equation containing a lighting-computing
multi-layer perceptron. During the whole optimization, we regularize the
rendered normal maps by the uncalibrated photometric stereo estimated normals.
We also propose the 2D Gaussian ray-tracing for single directional light to
refine the incident lighting. The regularizations and the use of multi-view and
multi-light images mitigate the ill-posed problem of inverse rendering. After
optimization, the reconstructed object can be used for novel-view synthesis,
relighting, and material and shape editing. Experiments on both synthetic and
real datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms prior works in terms of
reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: 该方案为游戏数字角色实现设备端实时动画推理铺平道路，是模型驱动数字角色发展的重要突破

Abstract: The training of high-quality, robust machine learning models for
speech-driven 3D facial animation requires a large, diverse dataset of
high-quality audio-animation pairs. To overcome the lack of such a dataset,
recent work has introduced large pre-trained speech encoders that are robust to
variations in the input audio and, therefore, enable the facial animation model
to generalize across speakers, audio quality, and languages. However, the
resulting facial animation models are prohibitively large and lend themselves
only to offline inference on a dedicated machine. In this work, we explore
on-device, real-time facial animation models in the context of game
development. We overcome the lack of large datasets by using hybrid knowledge
distillation with pseudo-labeling. Given a large audio dataset, we employ a
high-performing teacher model to train very small student models. In contrast
to the pre-trained speech encoders, our student models only consist of
convolutional and fully-connected layers, removing the need for attention
context or recurrent updates. In our experiments, we demonstrate that we can
reduce the memory footprint to up to 3.4 MB and required future audio context
to up to 81 ms while maintaining high-quality animations. This paves the way
for on-device inference, an important step towards realistic, model-driven
digital characters.

Conclusion: GRR-CoCA架构改进有效提升多模态模型性能，证明LLM技术移植到视觉语言领域的可行性

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) image and text generation models are multimodal
models that have many similarities to large language models (LLMs). Despite
achieving strong performances, leading foundational multimodal model
architectures frequently lag behind the architectural sophistication of
contemporary LLMs. We propose GRR-CoCa, an improved SOTA Contrastive Captioner
(CoCa) model that incorporates Gaussian error gated linear units, root mean
squared normalization, and rotary positional embedding into the textual
decoders and the vision transformer (ViT) encoder. Each architectural
modification has been shown to improve model performance in LLMs, but has yet
to be adopted in CoCa. We benchmarked GRR-CoCa against Baseline CoCa, a model
with the same modified textual decoders but with CoCa's original ViT encoder.
We used standard pretraining and fine-tuning workflows to benchmark the models
on contrastive and generative tasks. Our GRR-CoCa significantly outperformed
Baseline CoCa on the pretraining dataset and three diverse fine-tuning
datasets. Pretraining improvements were 27.25% in contrastive loss, 3.71% in
perplexity, and 7.15% in CoCa loss. The average fine-tuning improvements were
13.66% in contrastive loss, 5.18% in perplexity, and 5.55% in CoCa loss. We
show that GRR-CoCa's modified architecture improves performance and
generalization across vision-language domains.

Result: 在MS-COCO、Flickr30k、NoCaps基准测试中显著提升ZIC模型表现，多个场景达到SOTA

Conclusion: SynC为优化合成数据提供有效策略，通过重用现有图像实现语义对齐，避免数据再生成本

Abstract: Zero-shot Image Captioning (ZIC) increasingly utilizes synthetic datasets
generated by text-to-image (T2I) models to mitigate the need for costly manual
annotation. However, these T2I models often produce images that exhibit
semantic misalignments with their corresponding input captions (e.g., missing
objects, incorrect attributes), resulting in noisy synthetic image-caption
pairs that can hinder model training. Existing dataset pruning techniques are
largely designed for removing noisy text in web-crawled data. However, these
methods are ill-suited for the distinct challenges of synthetic data, where
captions are typically well-formed, but images may be inaccurate
representations. To address this gap, we introduce SynC, a novel framework
specifically designed to refine synthetic image-caption datasets for ZIC.
Instead of conventional filtering or regeneration, SynC focuses on reassigning
captions to the most semantically aligned images already present within the
synthetic image pool. Our approach employs a one-to-many mapping strategy by
initially retrieving multiple relevant candidate images for each caption. We
then apply a cycle-consistency-inspired alignment scorer that selects the best
image by verifying its ability to retrieve the original caption via
image-to-text retrieval. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SynC
consistently and significantly improves performance across various ZIC models
on standard benchmarks (MS-COCO, Flickr30k, NoCaps), achieving state-of-the-art
results in several scenarios. SynC offers an effective strategy for curating
refined synthetic data to enhance ZIC.

Motivation: 现有红队测试忽视视觉输入的攻击面，导致对LVLMs资源消耗攻击的防御不足

Method: 使用视觉引导优化生成对抗性扰动，结合多目标并行损失函数实现通用攻击模板

Result: 服务响应延迟增加26↑，GPU利用率/内存消耗额外增加20%

Conclusion: 揭示了LVLMs的安全漏洞，建立了支持未来防御技术开发的红队测试框架

Abstract: Resource Consumption Attacks (RCAs) have emerged as a significant threat to
the deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). With the integration of vision
modalities, additional attack vectors exacerbate the risk of RCAs in large
vision-language models (LVLMs). However, existing red-teaming studies have
largely overlooked visual inputs as a potential attack surface, resulting in
insufficient mitigation strategies against RCAs in LVLMs. To address this gap,
we propose RECALLED (\textbf{RE}source \textbf{C}onsumption \textbf{A}ttack on
\textbf{L}arge Vision-\textbf{L}anguag\textbf{E} Mo\textbf{D}els), the first
approach for exploiting visual modalities to trigger unbounded RCAs
red-teaming. First, we present \textit{Vision Guided Optimization}, a
fine-grained pixel-level optimization, to obtain \textit{Output Recall}
adversarial perturbations, which can induce repeating output. Then, we inject
the perturbations into visual inputs, triggering unbounded generations to
achieve the goal of RCAs. Additionally, we introduce \textit{Multi-Objective
Parallel Losses} to generate universal attack templates and resolve
optimization conflicts when intending to implement parallel attacks. Empirical
results demonstrate that RECALLED increases service response latency by over 26
$\uparrow$, resulting in an additional 20\% increase in GPU utilization and
memory consumption. Our study exposes security vulnerabilities in LVLMs and
establishes a red-teaming framework that can facilitate future defense
development against RCAs.

Method: 构建LoRA-Leak框架（含15种攻击方法），在3个先进语言模型和3个NLP任务中验证攻击效果，探索不同微调设置和防御措施。

Conclusion: 预训练模型使MIAs威胁加剧，需在专业模型开发中加强数据隐私保护，建议结合特定防御策略。

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) typically adhere to a "pre-training and fine-tuning"
paradigm, where a universal pre-trained model can be fine-tuned to cater to
various specialized domains. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained the most
widespread use in LM fine-tuning due to its lightweight computational cost and
remarkable performance. Because the proportion of parameters tuned by LoRA is
relatively small, there might be a misleading impression that the LoRA
fine-tuning data is invulnerable to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs).
However, we identify that utilizing the pre-trained model can induce more
information leakage, which is neglected by existing MIAs. Therefore, we
introduce LoRA-Leak, a holistic evaluation framework for MIAs against the
fine-tuning datasets of LMs. LoRA-Leak incorporates fifteen membership
inference attacks, including ten existing MIAs, and five improved MIAs that
leverage the pre-trained model as a reference. In experiments, we apply
LoRA-Leak to three advanced LMs across three popular natural language
processing tasks, demonstrating that LoRA-based fine-tuned LMs are still
vulnerable to MIAs (e.g., 0.775 AUC under conservative fine-tuning settings).
We also applied LoRA-Leak to different fine-tuning settings to understand the
resulting privacy risks. We further explore four defenses and find that only
dropout and excluding specific LM layers during fine-tuning effectively
mitigate MIA risks while maintaining utility. We highlight that under the
"pre-training and fine-tuning" paradigm, the existence of the pre-trained model
makes MIA a more severe risk for LoRA-based LMs. We hope that our findings can
provide guidance on data privacy protection for specialized LM providers.

TL;DR: 双LLM代理协作通过同伴协作模式在数学解题中表现最佳，对话行为对协作效果至关重要


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究不同多智能体沟通策略对AI教育中协作问题解决的影响，推动LLM在教育领域的高效应用

Method: 使用GPT-4o模型在MATH数据集测试四种双代理沟通模式（师生互动/同伴协作/互惠教学/批判辩论）

Result: 双代理系统准确率优于单代理，同伴协作模式准确率最高（87.3% vs 单代理83.5%）；陈述、确认和提示类对话行为对解题效果贡献显著

Conclusion: 多代理框架需匹配有效沟通策略（如同伴协作）才能更好解决复杂教育问题，对话质量直接影响协作问题解决效能

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly utilized in AI-aided
education to support tutoring and learning. Effective communication strategies
among LLM agents improve collaborative problem-solving efficiency and
facilitate cost-effective adoption in education. However, little research has
systematically evaluated the impact of different communication strategies on
agents' problem-solving. Our study examines four communication modes,
\textit{teacher-student interaction}, \textit{peer-to-peer collaboration},
\textit{reciprocal peer teaching}, and \textit{critical debate}, in a
dual-agent, chat-based mathematical problem-solving environment using the
OpenAI GPT-4o model. Evaluated on the MATH dataset, our results show that
dual-agent setups outperform single agents, with \textit{peer-to-peer
collaboration} achieving the highest accuracy. Dialogue acts like statements,
acknowledgment, and hints play a key role in collaborative problem-solving.
While multi-agent frameworks enhance computational tasks, effective
communication strategies are essential for tackling complex problems in AI
education.

Motivation: 解决海报设计过程中同步获取多元受众反馈困难的问题，探索生成式AI在协同设计反馈流程中的应用潜力

Method: 1. 基于营销文档构建受众角色代理
2. 收集角色反馈并启动主持人引导的讨论
3. 用户研究(N=12)与在线对照评估(N=100)

Result: 用户研究显示工具能发现被忽视观点，在线评估验证角色反馈的适切性及讨论机制的有效整合能力

Conclusion: AI角色代理与讨论机制的结合能有效提升设计反馈的多样性，实现不同视角的有机整合与设计优化

Abstract: Poster designing can benefit from synchronous feedback from target audiences.
However, gathering audiences with diverse perspectives and reconciling them on
design edits can be challenging. Recent generative AI models present
opportunities to simulate human-like interactions, but it is unclear how they
may be used for feedback processes in design. We introduce PosterMate, a poster
design assistant that facilitates collaboration by creating audience-driven
persona agents constructed from marketing documents. PosterMate gathers
feedback from each persona agent regarding poster components, and stimulates
discussion with the help of a moderator to reach a conclusion. These
agreed-upon edits can then be directly integrated into the poster design.
Through our user study (N=12), we identified the potential of PosterMate to
capture overlooked viewpoints, while serving as an effective prototyping tool.
Additionally, our controlled online evaluation (N=100) revealed that the
feedback from an individual persona agent is appropriate given its persona
identity, and the discussion effectively synthesizes the different persona
agents' perspectives.

Motivation: 传统方法在处理薄壁结构时难以保证流体域的路径连通性，导致流体泄漏问题

Method: 结合约束Voronoi空间划分与Godunov有限体积法，构建精确贴合流固界面的网格系统

Result: 通过压缩空气气球、香槟瓶塞弹出和超音速小行星等场景验证双向能量传递效果

Conclusion: 该方法在保持计算稳定性的同时，成功解决了任意薄结构下的流体泄漏难题

Abstract: We present a novel discretization of coupled compressible fluid and thin
deformable structures that provides sufficient and necessary leakproofness by
preserving the path connectedness of the fluid domain. Our method employs a
constrained Voronoi-based spatial partitioning combined with Godunov-style
finite-volume time integration. The fluid domain is discretized into cells that
conform exactly to the fluid-solid interface, allowing boundary conditions to
be sharply resolved exactly at the interface. This enables direct force
exchange between the fluid and solid while ensuring that no fluid leaks through
the solid, even when arbitrarily thin. We validate our approach on a series of
challenging scenarios -- including a balloon propelled by internal compressed
air, a champagne cork ejecting after overcoming friction, and a supersonic
asteroid -- demonstrating bidirectional energy transfer between fluid and
solid.

Motivation: 现有评分方法存在两个痛点：点对点评分法未能充分利用LLM的比较能力，成对比较法在并行采样规模扩大时扩展效率低下

Method: 使用QwQ和DeepSeek-R1-0528等推理模型，通过简单提示让LLM从N个并行生成的候选方案中推理选择最优解

Result: 在数学推理任务中，GenSelect方法表现出比现有评分方法更好的性能

Conclusion: 结合LLM比较优势和高效扩展性，GenSelect为推理任务的测试时扩展提供了新解决方案

Abstract: Generative reward models with parallel sampling have enabled effective
test-time scaling for reasoning tasks. Current approaches employ pointwise
scoring of individual solutions or pairwise comparisons. However, pointwise
methods underutilize LLMs' comparative abilities, while pairwise methods scale
inefficiently with larger sampling budgets. We introduce GenSelect, where the
LLM uses long reasoning to select the best solution among N candidates. This
leverages LLMs' comparative strengths while scaling efficiently across parallel
sampling budgets. For math reasoning, we demonstrate that reasoning models,
such as QwQ and DeepSeek-R1-0528, excel at GenSelect, outperforming existing
scoring approaches with simple prompting.

Conclusion: GSPO通过序列级优化机制，在训练效率、稳定性和系统设计简化方面展现显著优势，为Qwen3模型带来突破性性能提升

Abstract: This paper introduces Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO), our stable,
efficient, and performant reinforcement learning algorithm for training large
language models. Unlike previous algorithms that adopt token-level importance
ratios, GSPO defines the importance ratio based on sequence likelihood and
performs sequence-level clipping, rewarding, and optimization. We demonstrate
that GSPO achieves superior training efficiency and performance compared to the
GRPO algorithm, notably stabilizes Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) RL training, and
has the potential for simplifying the design of RL infrastructure. These merits
of GSPO have contributed to the remarkable improvements in the latest Qwen3

TL;DR: CHiME-7/8挑战赛聚焦多通道语音识别与说话人日志的联合优化，揭示端到端ASR主导、引导源分离仍关键、说话人计数影响显著、LLM掩盖转录误差等技术趋势


<details>

Motivation: 推动复杂声学环境下实时对话语音的自动转录技术发展，解决多设备录音场景中ASR与说话人分离的协同优化难题

Method: 基于9个团队32个系统的实验分析，结合基线系统评估端到端ASR、预训练模型应用、引导源分离(GSS)和目标说话人日志(TS-VAD)等技术路线

Result: 最佳系统时间约束WER达11%，但下游摘要任务中50%WER系统与11%WER系统表现相近（LLM纠错效应）；说话人计数错误导致级联失效问题突出

Conclusion: 当前神经语音增强技术仍依赖传统GSS，自发语音的准确转录存在瓶颈，需加强端到端系统鲁棒性和实时分离算法研究

Abstract: The CHiME-7 and 8 distant speech recognition (DASR) challenges focus on
multi-channel, generalizable, joint automatic speech recognition (ASR) and
diarization of conversational speech. With participation from 9 teams
submitting 32 diverse systems, these challenges have contributed to
state-of-the-art research in the field. This paper outlines the challenges'
design, evaluation metrics, datasets, and baseline systems while analyzing key
trends from participant submissions. From this analysis it emerges that: 1)
Most participants use end-to-end (e2e) ASR systems, whereas hybrid systems were
prevalent in previous CHiME challenges. This transition is mainly due to the
availability of robust large-scale pre-trained models, which lowers the data
burden for e2e-ASR. 2) Despite recent advances in neural speech separation and
enhancement (SSE), all teams still heavily rely on guided source separation,
suggesting that current neural SSE techniques are still unable to reliably deal
with complex scenarios and different recording setups. 3) All best systems
employ diarization refinement via target-speaker diarization techniques.
Accurate speaker counting in the first diarization pass is thus crucial to
avoid compounding errors and CHiME-8 DASR participants especially focused on
this part. 4) Downstream evaluation via meeting summarization can correlate
weakly with transcription quality due to the remarkable effectiveness of
large-language models in handling errors. On the NOTSOFAR-1 scenario, even
systems with over 50\% time-constrained minimum permutation WER can perform
roughly on par with the most effective ones (around 11\%). 5) Despite recent
progress, accurately transcribing spontaneous speech in challenging acoustic
environments remains difficult, even when using computationally intensive
system ensembles.

TL;DR: 提出使用LLM文本嵌入模型解决法律案例检索中的长文本输入限制和数据不足问题，在四个数据集上超越传统BM25和监督模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律系统依赖判例检索，但传统深度学习方法受限于文本长度和训练数据不足。现有法律检索数据集规模小且存在隐私问题，导致BERT类模型效果不佳。

Method: 采用支持长文本输入的LLM嵌入模型，以无监督方式直接生成案例向量表示，避免训练数据依赖和文本截断问题。

Result: 在四个法律案例检索基准测试中，LLM嵌入模型相较BM25平均提升9.2%的nDCG指标，较监督模型提升4.7%。

Conclusion: LLM的无监督长文本处理能力有效突破法律检索两大瓶颈，为零样本场景提供新解决方案，推动法律智能化发展。

Abstract: In common law systems, legal professionals such as lawyers and judges rely on
precedents to build their arguments. As the volume of cases has grown massively
over time, effectively retrieving prior cases has become essential. Prior case
retrieval (PCR) is an information retrieval (IR) task that aims to
automatically identify the most relevant court cases for a specific query from
a large pool of potential candidates. While IR methods have seen several
paradigm shifts over the last few years, the vast majority of PCR methods
continue to rely on traditional IR methods, such as BM25. The state-of-the-art
deep learning IR methods have not been successful in PCR due to two key
challenges: i. Lengthy legal text limitation; when using the powerful
BERT-based transformer models, there is a limit of input text lengths, which
inevitably requires to shorten the input via truncation or division with a loss
of legal context information. ii. Lack of legal training data; due to data
privacy concerns, available PCR datasets are often limited in size, making it
difficult to train deep learning-based models effectively. In this research, we
address these challenges by leveraging LLM-based text embedders in PCR.
LLM-based embedders support longer input lengths, and since we use them in an
unsupervised manner, they do not require training data, addressing both
challenges simultaneously. In this paper, we evaluate state-of-the-art
LLM-based text embedders in four PCR benchmark datasets and show that they
outperform BM25 and supervised transformer-based models.

Motivation: 现有密集检索模型因医学知识不足或训练语料不匹配，难以有效解决EHR检索中的语义鸿沟问题

Method: 1. 第一阶段从MIMIC-IV数据提取医学实体并注入知识图谱信息
2. 第二阶段用大语言模型生成多样化训练数据
3. 训练110M和7B两种参数规模的模型

Result: 在CliniQ基准显著超越现有模型，语义匹配(如隐含关系/缩写)表现突出，消融实验验证各模块有效性，QA数据集测试显示对复杂自然语言问题的泛化能力

Conclusion: DR.EHR通过系统的知识注入和数据增强策略，为临床EHR检索提供高效解决方案，并证明大参数模型在医疗语义匹配中的优势

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are pivotal in clinical practices, yet their
retrieval remains a challenge mainly due to semantic gap issues. Recent
advancements in dense retrieval offer promising solutions but existing models,
both general-domain and biomedical-domain, fall short due to insufficient
medical knowledge or mismatched training corpora. This paper introduces
\texttt{DR.EHR}, a series of dense retrieval models specifically tailored for
EHR retrieval. We propose a two-stage training pipeline utilizing MIMIC-IV
discharge summaries to address the need for extensive medical knowledge and
large-scale training data. The first stage involves medical entity extraction
and knowledge injection from a biomedical knowledge graph, while the second
stage employs large language models to generate diverse training data. We train
two variants of \texttt{DR.EHR}, with 110M and 7B parameters, respectively.
Evaluated on the CliniQ benchmark, our models significantly outperforms all
existing dense retrievers, achieving state-of-the-art results. Detailed
analyses confirm our models' superiority across various match and query types,
particularly in challenging semantic matches like implication and abbreviation.
Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each pipeline component, and
supplementary experiments on EHR QA datasets demonstrate the models'
generalizability on natural language questions, including complex ones with
multiple entities. This work significantly advances EHR retrieval, offering a
robust solution for clinical applications.

Motivation: 医疗领域ML部署存在预处理流程碎片化、模型兼容性差、数据隐私要求严格等痛点，导致实施成本高昂且效率低下。

Method: 构建模块化代理系统：1) 数据摄取标识代理识别数据类型；2) 匿名化代理保障隐私；3) 特征提取代理（结构化数据用嵌入方法，图像用MedGemma）；4) 模型匹配代理选择最优模型；5) 预处理代理定制化处理；6) 推理代理生成可解释结果（SHAP/LIME/DETR）。

Conclusion: 该框架通过自动化ML生命周期中的关键环节，为临床环境提供了可扩展、经济高效的AI部署路径，推动医疗AI的快速落地。

Abstract: Building and deploying machine learning solutions in healthcare remains
expensive and labor-intensive due to fragmented preprocessing workflows, model
compatibility issues, and stringent data privacy constraints. In this work, we
introduce an Agentic AI framework that automates the entire clinical data
pipeline, from ingestion to inference, through a system of modular,
task-specific agents. These agents handle both structured and unstructured
data, enabling automatic feature selection, model selection, and preprocessing
recommendation without manual intervention. We evaluate the system on publicly
available datasets from geriatrics, palliative care, and colonoscopy imaging.
For example, in the case of structured data (anxiety data) and unstructured
data (colonoscopy polyps data), the pipeline begins with file-type detection by
the Ingestion Identifier Agent, followed by the Data Anonymizer Agent ensuring
privacy compliance, where we first identify the data type and then anonymize
it. The Feature Extraction Agent identifies features using an embedding-based
approach for tabular data, extracting all column names, and a multi-stage
MedGemma-based approach for image data, which infers modality and disease name.
These features guide the Model-Data Feature Matcher Agent in selecting the
best-fit model from a curated repository. The Preprocessing Recommender Agent
and Preprocessing Implementor Agent then apply tailored preprocessing based on
data type and model requirements. Finally, the ``Model Inference Agent" runs
the selected model on the uploaded data and generates interpretable outputs
using tools like SHAP, LIME, and DETR attention maps. By automating these
high-friction stages of the ML lifecycle, the proposed framework reduces the
need for repeated expert intervention, offering a scalable, cost-efficient
pathway for operationalizing AI in clinical environments.

Conclusion: 首次证明AI安全与能力可协同进化，提出的框架具有强通用性，为构建可靠通用AI提供了可扩展的方案

Abstract: We introduce SafeWork-R1, a cutting-edge multimodal reasoning model that
demonstrates the coevolution of capabilities and safety. It is developed by our
proposed SafeLadder framework, which incorporates large-scale, progressive,
safety-oriented reinforcement learning post-training, supported by a suite of
multi-principled verifiers. Unlike previous alignment methods such as RLHF that
simply learn human preferences, SafeLadder enables SafeWork-R1 to develop
intrinsic safety reasoning and self-reflection abilities, giving rise to safety
`aha' moments. Notably, SafeWork-R1 achieves an average improvement of
$46.54\%$ over its base model Qwen2.5-VL-72B on safety-related benchmarks
without compromising general capabilities, and delivers state-of-the-art safety
performance compared to leading proprietary models such as GPT-4.1 and Claude
Opus 4. To further bolster its reliability, we implement two distinct
inference-time intervention methods and a deliberative search mechanism,
enforcing step-level verification. Finally, we further develop
SafeWork-R1-InternVL3-78B, SafeWork-R1-DeepSeek-70B, and
SafeWork-R1-Qwen2.5VL-7B. All resulting models demonstrate that safety and
capability can co-evolve synergistically, highlighting the generalizability of
our framework in building robust, reliable, and trustworthy general-purpose AI.

Motivation: 现有LS2模型对训练数据记忆的脆弱性缺乏系统研究，特别是跨模态记忆泄露问题尚未被探索。

Method: 设计对抗性音素提示攻击(APT)，结合同音替换扭曲语义，通过CLAP/AudioJudge/CoverID等多模态指标评估记忆重现程度。

Result: 音频模型在音素攻击下生成内容与原始训练数据相似度达75%，视频模型重现原MV视觉元素(人物/场景)成功率62%。

Conclusion: 音素提示可突破多模态生成系统防线，暴露底层数据记忆风险，亟需建立新的内容溯源与版权保护机制。

Abstract: Lyrics-to-Song (LS2) generation models promise end-to-end music synthesis
from text, yet their vulnerability to training data memorization remains
underexplored. We introduce Adversarial PhoneTic Prompting (APT), a novel
attack where lyrics are semantically altered while preserving their acoustic
structure through homophonic substitutions (e.g., Eminem's famous "mom's
spaghetti" $\rightarrow$ "Bob's confetti"). Despite these distortions, we
uncover a powerful form of sub-lexical memorization: models like SUNO and YuE
regenerate outputs strikingly similar to known training content, achieving high
similarity across audio-domain metrics, including CLAP, AudioJudge, and
CoverID. This vulnerability persists across multiple languages and genres. More
surprisingly, we discover that phoneme-altered lyrics alone can trigger visual
memorization in text-to-video models. When prompted with phonetically modified
lyrics from Lose Yourself, Veo 3 reconstructs visual elements from the original
music video -- including character appearance and scene composition -- despite
no visual cues in the prompt. We term this phenomenon phonetic-to-visual
regurgitation. Together, these findings expose a critical vulnerability in
transcript-conditioned multimodal generation: phonetic prompting alone can
unlock memorized audiovisual content, raising urgent questions about copyright,
safety, and content provenance in modern generative systems. Example
generations are available on our demo page (jrohsc.github.io/music_attack/).
