This paper presents Shona spaCy, an open-source, rule-based morphological pipeline for Shona built on the spaCy framework. The system combines a curated JSON lexicon with linguistically grounded rules to model noun-class prefixes (Mupanda 1-18), verbal subject concords, tense-aspect markers, ideophones, and clitics, integrating these into token-level annotations for lemma, part-of-speech, and morphological features. The toolkit is available via pip install shona-spacy, with source code at https://github.com/HappymoreMasoka/shona-spacy and a PyPI release at https://pypi.org/project/shona-spacy/0.1.4/. Evaluation on formal and informal Shona corpora yields 90% POS-tagging accuracy and 88% morphological-feature accuracy, while maintaining transparency in its linguistic decisions.

However, existing vector database (VecDB) retrieval pipelines rely on flat or single-resolution indexing structures, which cannot adapt to the varying semantic granularity required by diverse user queries. This limitation leads to suboptimal trade-offs between retrieval speed and contextual relevance.\n  To address this, we propose \\textbf{Semantic Pyramid Indexing (SPI)}, a novel multi-resolution vector indexing framework that introduces query-adaptive resolution control for RAG in VecDBs. Unlike existing hierarchical methods that require offline tuning or separate model training, SPI constructs a semantic pyramid over document embeddings and dynamically selects the optimal resolution level per query through a lightweight classifier. This adaptive approach enables progressive retrieval from coarse-to-fine representations, significantly accelerating search while maintaining semantic coverage.\n  We implement SPI as a plugin for both FAISS and Qdrant backends and evaluate it across multiple RAG tasks including MS MARCO, Natural Questions, and multimodal retrieval benchmarks. SPI achieves up to \\textbf{5.7$\\times$} retrieval speedup and \\textbf{1.8$\\times$} memory efficiency gain while improving end-to-end QA F1 scores by up to \\textbf{2.5 points} compared to strong baselines. Our theoretical analysis provides guarantees on retrieval quality and latency bounds, while extensive ablation studies validate the contribution of each component. The framework's compatibility with existing VecDB infrastructures makes it readily deployable in production RAG systems.

While the growing availability of small open-source models and inference engines has lowered the entry barrier, users now face an overwhelming number of configuration choices. Identifying an optimal configuration -- balancing functional and non-functional requirements -- requires substantial manual effort. While several benchmarks target LLM inference, they are designed for narrow evaluation goals and not user-focused. They fail to integrate relevant system and task-specific metrics into a unified, easy-to-use benchmark that supports multiple inference engines, usage scenarios, and quantization levels. To address this gap, we present Bench360 -- Benchmarking Local LLM Inference from 360\u00b0. Bench360 allows users to easily define their own custom tasks along with datasets and relevant task-specific metrics and then automatically benchmarks selected LLMs, inference engines, and quantization levels across different usage scenarios (single stream, batch & server). Bench360 tracks a wide range of metrics, including (1) system metrics -- such as Computing Performance (e.g., latency, throughput), Resource Usage (e.g., energy per query), and Deployment (e.g., cold start time) -- and (2) task-specific metrics such as ROUGE, F1 score or accuracy. We demonstrate Bench360 on four common LLM tasks -- General Knowledge & Reasoning, QA, Summarization and Text-to-SQL -- across three hardware platforms and four state of the art inference engines. Our results reveal several interesting trade-offs between task performance and system-level efficiency, highlighting the differences in inference engines and models.

We introduce PhysMorph-GS, which couples a differentiable material point method (MPM) with 3D Gaussian splatting through a deformation-aware upsampling bridge that maps sparse particle states (x, F) to dense Gaussians (mu, Sigma). Multi-modal rendering losses on silhouette and depth backpropagate along two paths, from covariances to deformation gradients via a stretch-based mapping and from Gaussian means to particle positions. Through the MPM adjoint, these gradients update deformation controls while mass is conserved at a compact set of anchor particles. A multi-pass interleaved optimization scheme repeatedly injects rendering gradients into successive physics steps, avoiding collapse to purely physics-driven solutions. On challenging morphing sequences, PhysMorph-GS improves boundary fidelity and temporal stability over a differentiable MPM baseline and better reconstructs thin structures such as ears and tails. Quantitatively, our depth-supervised variant reduces Chamfer distance by about 2.5 percent relative to the physics-only baseline. By providing a differentiable particle-to-Gaussian bridge, PhysMorph-GS closes a key gap in physics-aware rendering pipelines and enables inverse design directly from image-space supervision.", "AI": {"tldr": "PhysMorph-GS\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7269\u8d28\u70b9\u6cd5(MPM)\u4e0e3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\u7684\u6865\u63a5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6e32\u67d3\u635f\u5931\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u7269\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u5f62\u6001\u53d8\u5f62\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728'\u6e32\u67d3\u95f4\u9699'\u2014\u2014\u4e0d\u53ef\u5fae\u8868\u9762\u63d0\u53d6\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u635f\u5931\u76f4\u63a5\u6307\u5bfc\u7269\u7406\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u9700\u6784\u5efa\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u6e32\u67d3\u7684\u6865\u6881\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53d8\u5f62\u611f\u77e5\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u6865\u63a5\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u62c9\u4f38\u6620\u5c04\u5c06\u7c92\u5b50\u53d8\u5f62\u68af\u5ea6(F)\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u9ad8\u65af\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u7ed3\u5408\u6e32\u67d3\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u951a\u70b9\u7c92\u5b50\u4fdd\u6301\u8d28\u91cf\u5b88\u6052\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5f62\u6001\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u8fb9\u754c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u76d1\u7763\u7248\u672cChamfer\u8ddd\u79bb\u964d\u4f4e2.5%\uff0c\u8584\u7ed3\u6784(\u8033\u6735/\u5c3e\u5df4)\u91cd\u5efa\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eaf\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7c92\u5b50-\u9ad8\u65af\u6865\u63a5\u673a\u5236\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u6e32\u67d3\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u7269\u7406\u9006\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

While adaptive decision boundary methods have shown great potential by eliminating manual threshold tuning, existing approaches assume isotropic distributions of known classes, restricting boundaries to balls and overlooking distributional variance along different directions. To address this limitation, we propose EliDecide, a novel method that learns ellipsoid decision boundaries with varying scales along different feature directions. First, we employ supervised contrastive learning to obtain a discriminative feature space for known samples. Second, we apply learnable matrices to parameterize ellipsoids as the boundaries of each known class, offering greater flexibility than spherical boundaries defined solely by centers and radii. Third, we optimize the boundaries via a novelly designed dual loss function that balances empirical and open-space risks: expanding boundaries to cover known samples while contracting them against synthesized pseudo-open samples. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple text intent benchmarks and further on a question classification dataset.

Since lens blur typically varies with scene depth, the placement of virtual objects and their corresponding blur levels significantly affect the visual fidelity of mixed reality compositions. Existing pipelines often rely on camera parameters (e.g., focal length, focus distance, aperture size) and scene depth to compute the circle of confusion (CoC) for realistic lens blur rendering. However, such information is often unavailable to ordinary users, limiting the accessibility and generalizability of these methods. In this work, we propose a novel compositing approach that directly estimates the CoC map from RGB images, bypassing the need for scene depth or camera metadata. The CoC values for virtual objects are inferred through a linear relationship between its signed CoC map and depth, and realistic lens blur is rendered using a neural reblurring network.

Although significant advances have been made in detecting toxic language in textual data, the exploration of concept-based explanations in toxicity detection remains limited. In this study, we leverage various subtype attributes present in toxicity detection datasets, such as obscene, threat, insult, identity attack, and sexual explicit as concepts that serve as strong indicators to identify whether language is toxic. However, disproportionate attribution of concepts towards the target class often results in classification errors. Our work introduces an interpretability technique based on the Concept Gradient (CG) method which provides a more causal interpretation by measuring how changes in concepts directly affect the output of the model. This is an extension of traditional gradient-based methods in machine learning, which often focus solely on input features. We propose the curation of Targeted Lexicon Set, which captures toxic words that contribute to misclassifications in text classification models. To assess the significance of these lexicon sets in misclassification, we compute Word-Concept Alignment (WCA) scores, which quantify the extent to which these words lead to errors due to over-attribution to toxic concepts. Finally, we introduce a lexicon-free augmentation strategy by generating toxic samples that exclude predefined toxic lexicon sets. This approach allows us to examine whether over-attribution persists when explicit lexical overlap is removed, providing insights into the model's attribution on broader toxic language patterns.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u5ff5\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdb\u6bd2\u6027\u8bed\u8a00\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bcd-\u6982\u5ff5\u5bf9\u9f50\u5206\u6570\u548c\u53bb\u8bcd\u5178\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5f52\u56e0\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6bd2\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u6982\u5ff5\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6982\u5ff5\u5f52\u56e0\u5931\u8861\u5bfc\u81f4\u5206\u7c7b\u9519\u8bef", "method": "1. \u6982\u5ff5\u68af\u5ea6(CG)\u65b9\u6cd5\u5efa\u7acb\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0e\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u89e3\u91ca\n2. \u6784\u5efa\u76ee\u6807\u8bcd\u5178\u96c6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6709\u6bd2\u8bcd\u6c47\n3. \u8bcd-\u6982\u5ff5\u5bf9\u9f50(WCA)\u8bc4\u5206\u91cf\u5316\u5f52\u56e0\u504f\u5dee\n4. \u65e0\u8bcd\u5178\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6bd2\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u8bcd\u6c47\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5f52\u56e0\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u53bb\u8bcd\u5178\u6837\u672c\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u6bd2\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bef\u5224", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89e3\u91ca\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8868\u5c42\u8bcd\u6c47\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u53ca\u6df1\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u5c40\u9650"}}

However, if a human-authored article is slightly polished by AI, a shift will occur in the borderline decision of these AI detection models, leading them to consider it AI-generated article. This misclassification may result in falsely accusing authors of AI plagiarism and harm the credibility of AI detector models. In English, some efforts were made to meet this challenge, but not in Arabic. In this paper, we generated two datasets. The first dataset contains 800 Arabic articles, half AI-generated and half human-authored. We used it to evaluate 14 Large Language models (LLMs) and commercial AI detectors to assess their ability in distinguishing between human-authored and AI-generated articles. The best 8 models were chosen to act as detectors for our primary concern, which is whether they would consider slightly polished human text as AI-generated. The second dataset, Ar-APT, contains 400 Arabic human-authored articles polished by 10 LLMs using 4 polishing settings, totaling 16400 samples. We use it to evaluate the 8 nominated models and determine whether slight polishing will affect their performance. The results reveal that all AI detectors incorrectly attribute a significant number of articles to AI. The best performing LLM, Claude-4 Sonnet, achieved 83.51%, their performance decreased to 57.63% for articles slightly polished by LLaMA-3.

To address these issues, we propose a novel native 3D editing framework that directly manipulates 3D representations in a single, efficient feed-forward pass. Specifically, we create a large-scale, multi-modal dataset for instruction-guided 3D editing, covering diverse addition, deletion, and modification tasks. This dataset is meticulously curated to ensure that edited objects faithfully adhere to the instructional changes while preserving the consistency of unedited regions with the source object. Building upon this dataset, we explore two distinct conditioning strategies for our model: a conventional cross-attention mechanism and a novel 3D token concatenation approach.

Our experiments confirm that test-time training significantly reduces perplexity and bits-per-byte metrics across diverse domains from The Pile, with the largest improvements in structured or specialized datasets such as GitHub and EuroParl. We further validate that models not pretrained on The Pile benefit more from this adaptation than models already trained on similar data, allowing smaller models to approach the performance of larger ones.

We conduct a comprehensive probing study on six multilingual LLMs, covering all 268 transformer layers, using linear and nonlinear probes together with a new Token--Language Alignment analysis to quantify the layer-wise dynamics and geometric structure of language encoding. Our results show that language information becomes sharply separated in the first transformer block (+76.4$\\pm$8.2 percentage points from Layer 0 to 1) and remains almost fully linearly separable throughout model depth. We further find that the alignment between language directions and vocabulary embeddings is strongly tied to the language composition of the training data. Notably, Chinese-inclusive models achieve a ZH Match@Peak of 16.43\\%, whereas English-centric models achieve only 3.90\\%, revealing a 4.21$\\times$ structural imprinting effect. These findings indicate that multilingual LLMs distinguish languages not by surface script features but by latent representational structures shaped by the training corpus.

Knowledge retrieval in SNOMED CT is critical for its application, but often proves challenging due to language ambiguity, synonyms, polysemies and so on. This problem is exacerbated when the queries are out-of-vocabulary (OOV), i.e., having no equivalent matchings in the ontology. In this work, we focus on the problem of hierarchical concept retrieval from SNOMED CT with OOV queries, and propose an approach based on language model-based ontology embeddings. For evaluation, we construct OOV queries annotated against SNOMED CT concepts, testing the retrieval of the most direct subsumers and their less relevant ancestors. We find that our method outperforms the baselines including SBERT and two lexical matching methods.

Uncensored Dolphin matches safety-trained models, demonstrating empathy encoding emerges independent of safety training. Phi-3 probes correlate strongly with EIA behavioral scores (r=0.71, p<0.01).

Phi-3 shows 61.7% success with similar coherence. Dolphin exhibits asymmetric steerability: 94.4% success for pro-empathy steering but catastrophic breakdown for anti-empathy (empty outputs, code artifacts).\n  Implications: The detection-steering gap varies by model.

Specifically, SCM constructs a soft concept vector by forming a probability-weighted average of embeddings.

To address this, we frame the latent reasoning of TRMs as a form of classifier-free guidance and implicit policy improvement algorithm. Building on these insights, we propose a novel training scheme that provides a target for each loop during training. We demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances training efficiency. Our method reduces the total number of forward passes by 18x and eliminates halting mechanisms, while maintaining quality comparable to standard TRMs. Notably, we achieve 24% accuracy on ARC-1 with only 0.8M parameters, outperforming most LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u76ee\u6807\u5316\u5faa\u73af\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06TRM\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0e\u65e0\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b018\u500d\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5c0f\u578b\u5faa\u73af\u67b6\u6784TRMs\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6548\u7387\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u4fee\u6539\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u7684\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347", "method": "\u5c06TRM\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u65e0\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5faa\u73af\u9636\u6bb5\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u505c\u6b62\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u9690\u5f0f\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6", "result": "\u53c2\u6570\u91cf0.8M\u65f6ARC-1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe24%\uff08\u8d85\u8d8a\u591a\u6570LLMs\uff09\uff0c\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u6b21\u6570\u51cf\u5c1118\u500d\u4e14\u53bb\u9664\u505c\u6b62\u673a\u5236", "conclusion": "\u76ee\u6807\u5316\u5faa\u73af\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347TRM\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

With growing controversial topics, it is desirable to summarize not only diverse arguments, but also their rationale and justification. Early studies on text summarization focus on capturing general salient information in source documents, overlooking the argumentative nature of online conversations. Recent research on conversation summarization although considers the argumentative relationship among sentences, fail to explicate deeper argument structure within sentences for summarization. In this paper, we propose a novel task of argument-aware quantitative summarization to reveal the claim-reason structure of arguments in conversations, with quantities measuring argument strength. We further propose ARQUSUMM, a novel framework to address the task. To reveal the underlying argument structure within sentences, ARQUSUMM leverages LLM few-shot learning grounded in the argumentation theory to identify propositions within sentences and their claim-reason relationships. For quantitative summarization, ARQUSUMM employs argument structure-aware clustering algorithms to aggregate arguments and quantify their support. Experiments show that ARQUSUMM outperforms existing conversation and quantitative summarization models and generate summaries representing argument structures that are more helpful to users, of high textual quality and quantification accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faARQUSUMM\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u8bba\u70b9\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u5b9a\u91cf\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e3b\u5f20-\u7406\u7531\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u8bba\u8bc1\u5f3a\u5ea6", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6458\u8981\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u6df1\u5c42\u53e5\u5b50\u5185\u8bba\u8bc1\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u91cf\u5316\u5c55\u73b0\u8bba\u70b9\u652f\u6301\u5ea6\uff0c\u9700\u63ed\u793a\u5b8c\u6574\u7684claim-reason\u8bba\u8bc1\u4f53\u7cfb", "method": "1. \u57fa\u4e8e\u8bba\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u8bc6\u522b\u53e5\u5b50\u5185\u547d\u9898\u53ca\u5176claim-reason\u5173\u7cfb\n2. \u5f00\u53d1\u8bba\u8bc1\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u805a\u5408\u8bba\u70b9\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u652f\u6301\u5ea6", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eARQUSUMM\u5728\u6587\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u91cf\u5316\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bba\u8bc1\u7ed3\u6784\u6458\u8981\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u66f4\u5177\u5e2e\u52a9\u6027", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6458\u8981\u4e2d\u8bba\u70b9\u7ed3\u6784\u63ed\u793a\u4e0e\u91cf\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e89\u8bae\u8bdd\u9898\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5b9a\u91cf\u652f\u6301"}}

Using Hunan's modern historical celebrities shaped by Huxiang culture as a case study, pre-trained large models can help researchers efficiently extract key information, including biographical attributes, life events, and social relationships, from textual sources and construct structured knowledge graphs. However, systematic data resources for Hunan's historical celebrities remain limited, and general-purpose models often underperform in domain knowledge extraction and structured output generation in such low-resource settings. To address these issues, this study proposes a supervised fine-tuning approach for enhancing domain-specific information extraction. First, we design a fine-grained, schema-guided instruction template tailored to the Hunan historical celebrities domain and build an instruction-tuning dataset to mitigate the lack of domain-specific training corpora. Second, we apply parameter-efficient instruction fine-tuning to four publicly available large language models - Qwen2.5-7B, Qwen3-8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct - and develop evaluation criteria for assessing their extraction performance. Experimental results show that all models exhibit substantial performance gains after fine-tuning. Among them, Qwen3-8B achieves the strongest results, reaching a score of 89.3866 with 100 samples and 50 training iterations.

Yet, whether these models truly grasp visual persuasion-how visual cues shape human attitudes and decisions-remains unclear. To probe this question, we construct a high-consensus dataset for binary persuasiveness judgment and introduce the taxonomy of Visual Persuasive Factors (VPFs), encompassing low-level perceptual, mid-level compositional, and high-level semantic cues. We also explore cognitive steering and knowledge injection strategies for persuasion-relevant reasoning. Empirical analysis across VLMs reveals a recall-oriented bias-models over-predict high persuasiveness-and weak discriminative power for low/mid-level features.

Yet, despite increasing demand for transparency and interpretability, the field has yet to develop a widely accepted solution for interpretable automated scoring to be used in large-scale real-world assessments. This work takes a principled approach to address this challenge. We analyze the needs and potential benefits of interpretable automated scoring for various assessment stakeholders and develop four principles of interpretability -- Faithfulness, Groundedness, Traceability, and Interchangeability (FGTI) -- targeted at those needs. To illustrate the feasibility of implementing these principles, we develop the AnalyticScore framework for short answer scoring as a baseline reference framework for future research. AnalyticScore operates by (1) extracting explicitly identifiable elements of the responses, (2) featurizing each response into human-interpretable values using LLMs, and (3) applying an intuitive ordinal logistic regression model for scoring. In terms of scoring accuracy, AnalyticScore outperforms many uninterpretable scoring methods, and is within only 0.06 QWK of the uninterpretable SOTA on average across 10 items from the ASAP-SAS dataset.

With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), there is increasing interest in harnessing their capabilities for this purpose. However, most of the LLMs are inherently causal and optimized for next-token prediction, making them suboptimal for producing holistic representations. To address this, recent studies introduced pretext tasks to adapt LLMs for text representation. Most of these tasks, however, rely on token-level prediction objectives, such as the masked next-token prediction (MNTP) used in LLM2Vec. In this work, we explore the untapped potential of context compression as a pretext task for unsupervised adaptation of LLMs. During compression pre-training, the model learns to generate compact memory tokens, which substitute the whole context for downstream sequence prediction. Experiments demonstrate that a well-designed compression objective can significantly enhance LLM-based text representations, outperforming models trained with token-level pretext tasks. Further improvements through contrastive learning produce a strong representation model (LLM2Comp) that outperforms contemporary LLM-based text encoders on a wide range of tasks while being more sample-efficient, requiring significantly less training data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLLM2Comp\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u538b\u7f29\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u5347LLM\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e14\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfLLM\u57fa\u4e8etoken\u7ea7\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982MNTP\uff09\u7684\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u538b\u7f29\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u751f\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u8bb0\u5fc6token\u66ff\u4ee3\u5b8c\u6574\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u540e\u7eed\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u884c\u589e\u5f3a", "result": "LLM2Comp\u5728\u591a\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8aLLM2Vec\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u51cf\u5c1175%\u65f6\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u538b\u7f29\u662f\u6bd4token\u7ea7\u9884\u6d4b\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684LLM\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u6784\u5efa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6837\u672c\u9ad8\u6548\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u5668"}}

Abstention, where the model chooses not to answer and instead outputs phrases such as \"I don't know\", is a common safeguard. However, existing abstention methods typically rely on post-generation signals, such as generation variations or feedback, which limits their ability to prevent unreliable responses in advance. In this paper, we introduce Aspect-Based Causal Abstention (ABCA), a new framework that enables early abstention by analysing the internal diversity of LLM knowledge through causal inference. This diversity reflects the multifaceted nature of parametric knowledge acquired from various sources, representing diverse aspects such as disciplines, legal contexts, or temporal frames. ABCA estimates causal effects conditioned on these aspects to assess the reliability of knowledge relevant to a given query. Based on these estimates, we enable two types of abstention: Type-1, where aspect effects are inconsistent (knowledge conflict), and Type-2, where aspect effects consistently support abstention (knowledge insufficiency). Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that ABCA improves abstention reliability, achieves state-of-the-art performance, and enhances the interpretability of abstention decisions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faABCA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u6790\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e9\u671f\u62d2\u7b54\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u62d2\u7b54\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u751f\u6210\u540e\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u5982\u8f93\u51fa\u53d8\u4f53\u6216\u53cd\u9988\uff09\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u524d\u963b\u6b62\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u56de\u7b54\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u77e5\u8bc6\u5b58\u5728\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u80cc\u666f\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u6846\u67b6\u7b49\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u7279\u6027\u672a\u88ab\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5f03\u6743\u6846\u67b6\uff08ABCA\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6761\u4ef6\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u8bc4\u4f30\u77e5\u8bc6\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\u578b\uff08Type-1\uff09\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0d\u8db3\u578b\uff08Type-2\uff09\u4e24\u79cd\u5f03\u6743\u7c7b\u578b", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5f03\u6743\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u63d0\u534726.8%\uff0c\u51b3\u7b56\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a", "conclusion": "ABCA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6316\u6398\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e8b\u524d\u9884\u9632\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u4fe1AI\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84"}}

Traditional methods typically rely on statistical features like term frequencies or TF-IDF values, which are effective at capturing word-level importance but often fail to reflect contextual meaning. In contrast, modern deep learning approaches utilize semantic features to understand word usage within context, yet they may overlook simple, high-impact statistical indicators. This paper introduces an Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (AGFF) model that combines statistical and semantic features in a unified framework. The model applies an attention-based mechanism to dynamically determine the relative importance of each feature type, enabling more informed classification decisions. Through evaluation on benchmark news datasets, the AGFF model demonstrates superior performance compared to both traditional statistical models and purely semantic deep learning models. The results confirm that strategic integration of diverse feature types can significantly enhance classification accuracy. Additionally, ablation studies validate the contribution of each component in the fusion process.

Crucially, AutoLink exhibits \\textbf{exceptional scalability}, \\textbf{maintaining high recall}, \\textbf{efficient token consumption}, and \\textbf{robust execution accuracy} on large schemas (e.g., over 3,000 columns) where existing methods severely degrade-making it a highly scalable, high-recall schema-linking solution for industrial text-to-SQL systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "AutoLink\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8fed\u4ee3\u6a21\u5f0f\u94fe\u63a5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u6587\u672c\u5230SQL\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u4e0e\u6267\u884c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u5f0f\u94fe\u63a5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3001\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u4e0e\u566a\u97f3\u96be\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u3001\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6a21\u5f0f\u94fe\u63a5\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u8fed\u4ee3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u63a2\u7d22\u6269\u5c55\u76f8\u5173\u6a21\u5f0f\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u8f93\u5165\u5b8c\u6574\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "Bird-Dev\u4e0a\u6a21\u5f0f\u94fe\u63a5\u53ec\u56de\u738797.4%\uff08SOTA\uff09\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u51c6\u786e\u738768.7%\uff1bSpider-2.0-Lite\u53ec\u56de\u738791.2%\uff08SOTA\uff09\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u51c6\u786e\u738734.9%\uff08\u5b98\u65b9\u6392\u540d\u7b2c\u4e8c\uff09\u3002\u57283000+\u5217\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e2d\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "AutoLink\u4e3a\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u6587\u672c\u5230SQL\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u53ec\u56de\u3001\u4f4e\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u5f3a\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u94fe\u63a5\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7a81\u7834\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u89c4\u6a21\u9002\u7528\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u3002"}}

Motivated by neo-Davidsonian event semantics, we propose an event-centric alternative that represents conversational history as short, event-like propositions which bundle together participants, temporal cues, and minimal local context, rather than as independent relation triples or opaque summaries. In contrast to work that aggressively compresses or forgets past content, our design aims to preserve information in a non-compressive form and make it more accessible, rather than more lossy. Concretely, we instruct an LLM to decompose each session into enriched elementary discourse units (EDUs) -- self-contained statements with normalized entities and source turn attributions -- and organize sessions, EDUs, and their arguments in a heterogeneous graph that supports associative recall. On top of this representation we build two simple retrieval-based variants that use dense similarity search and LLM filtering, with an optional graph-based propagation step to connect and aggregate evidence across related EDUs. Experiments on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval$_S$ benchmarks show that these event-centric memories match or surpass strong baselines, while operating with much shorter QA contexts. Our results suggest that structurally simple, event-level memory provides a principled and practical foundation for long-horizon conversational agents.

Existing datasets for tabular QA, such as WikiTableQuestions and FinQA, are overwhelmingly monolingual (English) and present tables in a digitally perfect, clean format. This creates a significant gap between research and practice. To address this, we present \\textbf{MirageTVQA}, a new benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs on these exact dimensions. Featuring nearly 60,000 QA pairs across 24 languages, MirageTVQA challenges models with tables that are not only multilingual but also visually imperfect, incorporating realistic noise to mimic scanned documents. Our evaluation of the leading VLMs reveals two primary failure points: a severe degradation in performance (over 35\\% drop for the best models) when faced with visual noise and a consistent English-first bias where reasoning abilities fail to transfer to other languages. MirageTVQA provides a benchmark for measuring and driving progress towards more robust VLM models for table reasoning.

While existing approaches focus primarily on common actions like retweeting and liking, the prediction of rare but significant behaviors remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a hybrid methodology for social media user behavior prediction that addresses both frequent and infrequent actions across a diverse action vocabulary. We evaluate our approach on a large-scale Bluesky dataset containing 6.4 million conversation threads spanning 12 distinct user actions across 25 persona clusters. Our methodology combines four complementary approaches: (i) a lookup database system based on historical response patterns; (ii) persona-specific LightGBM models with engineered temporal and semantic features for common actions; (iii) a specialized hybrid neural architecture fusing textual and temporal representations for rare action classification; and (iv) generation of text replies. Our persona-specific models achieve an average macro F1-score of 0.64 for common action prediction, while our rare action classifier achieves 0.56 macro F1-score across 10 rare actions.

In multilingual communities sentiment analysis systems can be used to quickly identify social challenges in social media posts, enabling government departments to detect and address these issues more precisely and effectively. Recently, large-language models (LLMs) have become available to the wide public and initial analyses have shown that they exhibit magnificent zero-shot sentiment analysis abilities in English. However, there is no work that has investigated to leverage LLMs for sentiment analysis on social media posts in South African languages and detect social challenges. Consequently, in this work, we analyse the zero-shot performance of the state-of-the-art LLMs GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LlaMa 2, PaLM 2, and Dolly 2 to investigate the sentiment polarities of the 10 most emerging topics in English, Sepedi and Setswana social media posts that fall within the jurisdictional areas of 10 South African government departments. Our results demonstrate that there are big differences between the various LLMs, topics, and languages. In addition, we show that a fusion of the outcomes of different LLMs provides large gains in sentiment classification performance with sentiment classification errors below 1%.

As AI assistants become widespread throughout digital platforms, from virtual assistants to customer service, developing natural and humanlike interaction patterns seems crucial for maintaining user trust and engagement. We present the Humanlike Multi-user Agent (HUMA), an LLM-based facilitator that participates in multi-party conversations using human-like strategies and timing. HUMA extends prior multi-user chatbot work with an event-driven architecture that handles messages, replies, reactions and introduces realistic response-time simulation. HUMA comprises three components-Router, Action Agent, and Reflection-which together adapt LLMs to group conversation dynamics.\n  We evaluate HUMA in a controlled study with 97 participants in four-person role-play chats, comparing AI and human community managers (CMs).

We used the generalized additive model to decompose a given observed pitch contour into a set of component pitch contours that are tied to different control variables and semantic predictors. Even when variables such as word duration, gender, speaker identity, tonal context, vowel height, and utterance position are controlled for, the effect of word remains a strong predictor of tonal realization. We present evidence that this effect of word is a semantic effect: word sense is shown to be a better predictor than word, and heterographic homophones are shown to have different pitch contours. The strongest evidence for the importance of semantics is that the pitch contours of individual word tokens can be predicted from their contextualized embeddings with an accuracy that substantially exceeds a permutation baseline.

Its constrained output format allows for simplified, deterministic automatic verification. However, we find that the options may leak exploitable signals, which makes the accuracy metrics unreliable for indicating real capabilities and encourages explicit or implicit answer guessing behaviors during RFT. We propose ReVeL (Rewrite and Verify by LLM), a framework that rewrites multiple-choice questions into open-form questions while keeping answers verifiable whenever possible. The framework categorizes questions according to different answer types, apply different rewriting and verification schemes, respectively. When applied for RFT, we converted 20k MCQA examples and use GRPO to finetune Qwen2.5-VL models.

Large Language Model (LLM) based evaluators, though powerful, come with drawbacks like high costs, bias, inconsistency, and hallucinations. To address these issues, we introduce SMILE: Semantic Metric Integrating Lexical Exactness, a novel approach that combines sentence-level semantic understanding with keyword-level semantic understanding and easy keyword matching.

Meanwhile, token-level SFT often degenerates into rote memorization rather than inducing longer chains of thought. Inspired by BERT's self-supervised tasks, we propose MR-RLVR (Masked-and-Reordered RLVR), which constructs process-level self-supervised rewards via \"masked-then-fill\" and \"step reordering\" to extract learnable signals from intermediate reasoning. Our training pipeline comprises two stages: we first perform self-supervised training on sampled mathematical calculation and proof data; we then conduct RLVR fine-tuning on mathematical calculation datasets where only outcomes are verifiable. We implement MR-RLVR on Qwen2.5-3B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, and evaluate on AIME24, AIME25, AMC23, and MATH500. Under a fixed sampling and decoding budget, MR-RLVR achieves average relative gains over the original RLVR of +9.86% Pass@1, +5.27% Pass@5, and +4.00% Pass@8.

Drawing on theories from social cognition and the stereotype content model in Social Psychology, we analyze how English speakers talk about vaccines on social media to understand the evolving narrative around vaccines in social media posts. To do that, we first introduce a novel dataset comprising 18.7 million curated posts on vaccine discourse from 2013 to 2022. This extensive collection-filtered down from an initial 129 million posts through rigorous preprocessing-captures both pre-COVID and COVID-19 periods, offering valuable insights into the evolution of English-speaking X users' perceptions related to vaccines. Our analysis shows that the COVID-19 pandemic led to complex shifts in X users' sentiment and discourse around vaccines. We observe that negative emotion word usage decreased during the pandemic, with notable rises in usage of surprise, and trust related emotion words. Furthermore, vaccine-related language tended to use more warmth-focused words associated with trustworthiness, along with positive, competence-focused words during the early days of the pandemic, with a marked rise in negative word usage towards the end of the pandemic, possibly reflecting a growing vaccine hesitancy and skepticism.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u67901870\u4e07\u6761\u63a8\u6587\u53d1\u73b0\uff0cCOVID-19\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u82f1\u8bed\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u75ab\u82d7\u8ba8\u8bba\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u4fe1\u4efb\u8bcd\u6c47\u589e\u52a0\u4f46\u540e\u671f\u8d1f\u9762\u60c5\u7eea\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u75ab\u82d7\u72b9\u8c6b\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65b0\u51a0\u75ab\u60c5\u524d\u540e\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u75ab\u82d7\u8ba8\u8bba\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u7a81\u53d1\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u516c\u4f17\u5bf9\u75ab\u82d7\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u8868\u8fbe\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u793e\u4f1a\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u6784\u5efa2013-2022\u5e741870\u4e07\u6761\u75ab\u82d7\u76f8\u5173\u63a8\u6587\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8fd0\u7528\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5efa\u6a21\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u65f6\u671f\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u75ab\u60c5\u540e\u8d1f\u9762\u60c5\u7eea\u8bcd\u6c47\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u4fe1\u4efb/\u60ca\u8bb6\u8bcd\u6c47\u589e\u52a0\uff1b\u65e9\u671f\u6e29\u6696\u4fe1\u4efb\u8bed\u8a00\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u540e\u671f\u8d1f\u9762\u8bcd\u6c47\u6fc0\u589e\uff0c\u6697\u793a\u75ab\u82d7\u4fe1\u5fc3\u52a8\u6447\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7a81\u53d1\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4f1a\u5f15\u53d1\u75ab\u82d7\u8bdd\u8bed\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u9700\u5173\u6ce8\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u60c5\u611f\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u75ab\u82d7\u72b9\u8c6b\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

This implies a unidimensional latent construct underlying the measurement experiment, yielding expected ranges for various statistics for each item. When empirically estimated values for these statistics fall outside the expected range for an item, the item is more likely to be problematic. Across nine widely used benchmarks, our method guides expert review to identify problematic questions with up to 84\\% precision.

To address this gap, we introduce ConfusedTourist, a novel cultural adversarial robustness suite designed to assess VLMs' stability against perturbed geographical cues. Our experiments reveal a critical vulnerability, where accuracy drops heavily under simple image-stacking perturbations and even worsens with its image-generation-based variant. Interpretability analyses further show that these failures stem from systematic attention shifts toward distracting cues, diverting the model from its intended focus.

Submitted to Computational and Applied Mathematics (Springer)", "summary": "Discrete fuzzy numbers, and in particular those defined over a finite chain $L_n = \\{0, \\ldots, n\\}$, have been effectively employed to represent linguistic information within the framework of fuzzy systems. Research on total (admissible) orderings of such types of fuzzy subsets, and specifically those belonging to the set $\\mathcal{D}_1^{L_n\\rightarrow Y_m}$ consisting of discrete fuzzy numbers $A$ whose support is a closed subinterval of the finite chain $L_n = \\{0, 1, \\ldots, n\\}$ and whose membership values $A(x)$, for $x \\in L_n$, belong to the set $Y_m = \\{ 0 = y_1 < y_2 < \\cdots < y_{m-1} < y_m = 1 \\}$, has facilitated the development of new methods for constructing logical connectives, based on a bijective function, called $\\textit{pos function}$, that determines the position of each $A \\in \\mathcal{D}_1^{L_n\\rightarrow Y_m}$. For this reason, in this work we revisit the problem by introducing algorithms that exploit the combinatorial structure of total (admissible) orders to compute the $\\textit{pos}$ function and its inverse with exactness. The proposed approach achieves a complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(n^{2} m \\log n)$, which is quadratic in the size of the underlying chain ($n$) and linear in the number of membership levels ($m$). The key point is that the dominant factor is $m$, ensuring scalability with respect to the granularity of membership values.

Existing approaches face a persistent tradeoff between effective forgetting and preservation on the retain set. While previous methods provide useful heuristics, they often lack a formal analysis on how exactly forgetting updates harm retained knowledge, and whether the side effects can be removed with theoretical guarantees. To explore a theoretically sound and simple solution, we start from the first principle on how performance on the retain set is actually affected: a first-order analysis of the local change of the retain loss under small parameter updates during model training. We start from a crisp equivalence: the retain loss is unchanged to first order iff the update direction is orthogonal to the subspace spanned by retain gradients (\"retain-invariant\"). This identifies the entangled component as the tangential part of forget update within the retain-gradient subspace, and characterizes disentanglement as orthogonality. Guided by this, we propose the Geometric-disentanglement Unlearning (GU) that decomposes any candidate forget gradient update into tangential and normal components to retain space and executes only the normal component. Under a standard trust-region budget, the projected direction aligned with the raw forget gradient is optimal among all first-order retain-invariant moves, and we also derive the optimal projected direction for joint forget-retain updating objectives. Our method is plug-and-play and can be attached to existing gradient-based unlearning procedures to mitigate side effects. GU achieves consistent improvement on various methods across three benchmarks TOFU, MUSE, and WMDP.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u51e0\u4f55\u89e3\u7f20\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08GU\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u4ea4\u5206\u89e3\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u4fdd\u7559\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u526f\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9057\u5fd8\u6837\u672c\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u635f\u5bb3\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4fdd\u7559\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u3002\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u4e00\u9636\u5206\u6790\u89d2\u5ea6\u5efa\u7acb\u4fdd\u7559\u635f\u5931\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5bfb\u6c42\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "1. \u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u4fdd\u7559\u635f\u5931\u4e00\u9636\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8e\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u4e0e\u4fdd\u7559\u68af\u5ea6\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u6b63\u4ea4\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51faGU\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u9057\u5fd8\u68af\u5ea6\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4fdd\u7559\u7a7a\u95f4\u5207\u5411/\u6cd5\u5411\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u4ec5\u4fdd\u7559\u6cd5\u5411\u5206\u91cf\uff1b3. \u63a8\u5bfc\u4fe1\u4efb\u57df\u5185\u6700\u4f18\u6295\u5f71\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u53ef\u517c\u5bb9\u73b0\u6709\u68af\u5ea6\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728TOFU\u3001MUSE\u3001WMDP\u4e09\u5927\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cGU\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u73b0\u6709\u9057\u5fd8\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u51e0\u4f55\u89e3\u7f20\u7406\u8bba\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u6b63\u4ea4\u6295\u5f71\u673a\u5236\u65e2\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9057\u5fd8\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u53c8\u6700\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4fdd\u62a4\u4fdd\u7559\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

The music core algorithms connect critical lyrical and rhythmic information to automatically derive musical features, creating a complete, coherent melodic score solely from the lyrics. The MusicAIR framework facilitates music generation from lyrics, text, and images. The generated score adheres to established principles of music theory, lyrical structure, and rhythmic conventions. We developed Generate AI Music (GenAIM), a web tool using MusicAIR for lyric-to-song, text-to-music, and image-to-music generation. In our experiments, we evaluated AI-generated music scores produced by the system using both standard music metrics and innovative analysis that compares these compositions with original works. The system achieves an average key confidence of 85%, outperforming human composers at 79%, and aligns closely with established music theory standards, demonstrating its ability to generate diverse, human-like compositions.

The state-of-the-art approach uses multimodal transformers to generate robot action steps aligned with robot action confirmation from a single clip showing a task composed of multiple micro steps. Although actions towards a long-horizon task depend on each other throughout an entire video, the current approaches mainly focus on clip-level processing and do not leverage long-context information. This paper proposes a long-context Q-former incorporating left and right context dependency in full videos. Furthermore, this paper proposes a text-conditioning approach to feed text embeddings directly into the LLM decoder to mitigate the high abstraction of the information in text by Q-former. Experiments with the YouCook2 corpus show that the accuracy of confirmation generation is a major factor in the performance of action planning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the long-context Q-former improves the confirmation and action planning by integrating VideoLLaMA3.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587Q-former\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6587\u672c\u8c03\u8282\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408VideoLLaMA3\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u52a8\u4f5c\u786e\u8ba4\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u534f\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u7247\u6bb5\u7ea7\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u9891\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u4f5c\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u5efa\u6a21", "method": "1\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587Q-former\u6355\u6349\u89c6\u9891\u5de6\u53f3\u65f6\u5e8f\u4f9d\u8d56 2\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u76f4\u63a5\u5411LLM\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6ce8\u5165\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u8c03\u8282\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3Q-former\u4fe1\u606f\u62bd\u8c61\u8fc7\u9ad8\u95ee\u9898", "result": "\u5728YouCook2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1a\u52a8\u4f5c\u786e\u8ba4\u751f\u6210\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u662f\u89c4\u5212\u6027\u80fd\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u786e\u8ba4\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u6307\u6807\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b"}}

However, these methods mostly employ single-shot plans that are typically limited to simple motions, or iterative refinement which requires multiple calls to the video generator, incuring high computational cost. To overcome these limitations, we propose SketchVerify, a training-free, sketch-verification-based planning framework that improves motion planning quality with more dynamically coherent trajectories (i.e., physically plausible and instruction-consistent motions) prior to full video generation by introducing a test-time sampling and verification loop. Given a prompt and a reference image, our method predicts multiple candidate motion plans and ranks them using a vision-language verifier that jointly evaluates semantic alignment with the instruction and physical plausibility. To efficiently score candidate motion plans, we render each trajectory as a lightweight video sketch by compositing objects over a static background, which bypasses the need for expensive, repeated diffusion-based synthesis while achieving comparable performance. We iteratively refine the motion plan until a satisfactory one is identified, which is then passed to the trajectory-conditioned generator for final synthesis. Experiments on WorldModelBench and PhyWorldBench demonstrate that our method significantly improves motion quality, physical realism, and long-term consistency compared to competitive baselines while being substantially more efficient. Our ablation study further shows that scaling up the number of trajectory candidates consistently enhances overall performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSketchVerify\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8fd0\u52a8\u8f68\u8ff9\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5355\u6b21\u89c4\u5212\u7b80\u5355\u6216\u591a\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u5e73\u8861\u8fd0\u52a8\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8349\u56fe\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u8fd0\u52a8\u8f68\u8ff9\u2192\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\u2192\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u76f4\u81f3\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u4f73\u8f68\u8ff9\u2192\u6700\u7ec8\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891", "result": "\u5728WorldModelBench\u548cPhyWorldBench\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8fd0\u52a8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u7269\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u957f\u671f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad83.3\u500d", "conclusion": "SketchVerify\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u91c7\u6837-\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}
