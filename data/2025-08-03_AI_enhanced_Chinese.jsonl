Unfortunately, time favors the ill-intentioned in this\nrace, with fake videos growing increasingly difficult to distinguish from real\nones. At the root of this trend is a fundamental advantage held by those\nmanipulating media: equal access to a distribution of what we consider\nauthentic (i.e., \"natural\") video. In this paper, we show how coding very\nsubtle, noise-like modulations into the illumination of a scene can help combat\nthis advantage by creating an information asymmetry that favors verification.\nOur approach effectively adds a temporal watermark to any video recorded under\ncoded illumination. However, rather than encoding a specific message, this\nwatermark encodes an image of the unmanipulated scene as it would appear lit\nonly by the coded illumination. We show that even when an adversary knows that\nour technique is being used, creating a plausible coded fake video amounts to\nsolving a second, more difficult version of the original adversarial content\ncreation problem at an information disadvantage. This is a promising avenue for\nprotecting high-stakes settings like public events and interviews, where the\ncontent on display is a likely target for manipulation, and while the\nillumination can be controlled, the cameras capturing video cannot.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7f16\u7801\u573a\u666f\u5149\u7167\u6dfb\u52a0\u65f6\u5e8f\u6c34\u5370\uff0c\u5bf9\u6297\u89c6\u9891\u4f2a\u9020\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u9891\u4f2a\u9020\u5de5\u5177\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5047\u89c6\u9891\u96be\u4ee5\u9274\u522b\u3002\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u89c6\u9891\u62e5\u6709\u5e73\u7b49\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u5e03\u4f7f\u7528\u6743\uff0c\u9700\u521b\u9020\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4f18\u52bf", "method": "\u5728\u573a\u666f\u7167\u660e\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u7c7b\u4f3c\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u7ec6\u5fae\u65f6\u5e8f\u8c03\u5236\uff0c\u5c06\u672a\u7be1\u6539\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5149\u7167\u4fe1\u606f\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u6c34\u5370", "result": "\u5373\u4f7f\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u77e5\u6653\u8be5\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f2a\u9020\u89c6\u9891\u9700\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u52a3\u52bf\u4e0b\u89e3\u51b3\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u6c34\u5370\u590d\u539f\u539f\u59cb\u573a\u666f", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u4e3a\u9ad8\u4ef7\u503c\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u516c\u5171\u6d3b\u52a8\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u5149\u7167\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u63a7\u5236\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5177\u5907\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b"}}

These channels enable the anonymous trade of\nillicit goods including drugs, weapons, and stolen credentials. Detecting and\ncategorizing such content remains challenging due to limited labeled data, the\nevolving nature of illicit language, and the structural heterogeneity of online\nsources. This paper presents a hierarchical classification framework that\ncombines fine-tuned language models with a semi-supervised ensemble learning\nstrategy to detect and classify illicit marketplace content across diverse\nplatforms. We extract semantic representations using ModernBERT, a transformer\nmodel for long documents, finetuned on domain-specific data from deep and dark\nweb pages, Telegram channels, Subreddits, and Pastebin pastes to capture\nspecialized jargon and ambiguous linguistic patterns. In addition, we\nincorporate manually engineered features such as document structure, embedded\npatterns including Bitcoin addresses, emails, and IPs, and metadata, which\ncomplement language model embeddings. The classification pipeline operates in\ntwo stages. The first stage uses a semi-supervised ensemble of XGBoost, Random\nForest, and SVM with entropy-based weighted voting to detect sales-related\ndocuments. The second stage further classifies these into drug, weapon, or\ncredential sales. Experiments on three datasets, including our multi-source\ncorpus, DUTA, and CoDA, show that our model outperforms several baselines,\nincluding BERT, ModernBERT, DarkBERT, ALBERT, Longformer, and BigBird.

Meanwhile, combining\nmultiple models can achieve more efficient results, which have been proved in\nboth previous ensemble learning and the recent LLM training domain. Inspired by\nthese works,to address the similar challenges in AIOPS, this paper first\nproposes a collaboration-of-expert framework(CoE-Ops) incorporating a\ngeneral-purpose large language model task classifier.

These metrics can be used in quantitative bias analyses to assess the\nrobustness of results for an inferential study given potential bias from\noutcome misclassification. However, extensive time and resource allocation are\ntypically re-quired to create reference-standard labels through manual chart\nreview of free-text notes from linked electronic health records. Methods: We\ndescribe an expedited process that introduces efficiency in a validation study\nus-ing two distinct mechanisms: 1) use of natural language processing (NLP) to\nreduce time spent by human reviewers to review each chart, and 2) a multi-wave\nadaptive sampling approach with pre-defined criteria to stop the validation\nstudy once performance characteristics are identified with sufficient\nprecision. We illustrate this process in a case study that validates the\nperformance of a claims-based outcome algorithm for intentional self-harm in\npatients with obesity. Results: We empirically demonstrate that the\nNLP-assisted annotation process reduced the time spent on review per chart by\n40% and use of the pre-defined stopping rule with multi-wave samples would have\nprevented review of 77% of patient charts with limited compromise to precision\nin derived measurement characteristics.

Diverging from critical traditions that conflate\narbitrariness with injustice, it posits arbitrariness as a semiotic trait: a\nproperty enabling systems - linguistic, legal, or social - to operate\neffectively while withholding their internal rationale. Building on Ferdinand\nde Saussure's concept of l'arbitraire du signe, the analysis extends this\nprinciple beyond language to demonstrate its cross-domain applicability,\nparticularly in law and social dynamics. The paper introduces the \"Motivation\n-> Constatability -> Contestability\" chain, arguing that motivation functions\nas a crucial interface rendering an act's logic vulnerable to intersubjective\ncontestation. When this chain is broken through mechanisms like\n\"immotivization\" or \"Conflict Lateralization\" (exemplified by \"the blur of the\nwolf drowned in the fish\"), acts produce binding effects without exposing their\nrationale, thus precluding justiciability. This structural opacity, while\nappearing illogical, is a deliberate design protecting authority from\naccountability. Drawing on Shannon's entropy model, the paper formalizes\narbitrariness as A = H(L|M) (conditional entropy). It thereby proposes a modern\ntheory of arbitrariness as a neutral operator central to control as well as\ncare, an overlooked dimension of interpersonal relations. While primarily\ndeveloped through human social systems, this framework also illuminates a new\npathway for analyzing explainability in advanced artificial intelligence\nsystems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u4efb\u610f\u6027\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4f20\u7edf\u6279\u5224\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u71b5\u503c\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u6743\u529b\u4fdd\u62a4\u903b\u8f91", "motivation": "\u7a81\u7834\u6279\u5224\u7406\u8bba\u5bf9\u4efb\u610f\u6027\u4e0e\u4e0d\u516c\u7684\u6df7\u6dc6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4efb\u610f\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7b26\u53f7\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u7ef4\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd0\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u79ef\u6781\u529f\u80fd", "method": "\u5ef6\u4f38\u7d22\u7eea\u5c14\u7b26\u53f7\u4efb\u610f\u6027\u81f3\u6cd5\u5f8b/\u793e\u4f1a\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u52a8\u673a-\u53ef\u786e\u5b9a\u6027-\u53ef\u4e89\u8bae\u6027\u5206\u6790\u94fe\u6761\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u9999\u519c\u71b5\u6570\u5b66\u6a21\u578b", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u963b\u65ad\u52a8\u673a\u94fe\u6761\u4ea7\u751f\u7ea6\u675f\u6548\u529b\uff0c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4efb\u610f\u6027A=H(L|M)\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u5173\u6000\u7684\u4e2d\u7acb\u673a\u5236", "conclusion": "\u4efb\u610f\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6743\u5a01\u514d\u4e8e\u95ee\u8d23\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5206\u6790AI\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8def\u5f84"}}

Through\nexperiments, we discovered significant fragility in LLMs when handling\nambiguity, revealing behavior that differs substantially from humans.\nSpecifically, LLMs cannot reliably distinguish ambiguous text from unambiguous\ntext, show overconfidence in interpreting ambiguous text as having a single\nmeaning rather than multiple meanings, and exhibit overthinking when attempting\nto understand the various possible meanings. Our findings highlight a\nfundamental limitation in current LLMs that has significant implications for\ntheir deployment in real-world applications where linguistic ambiguity is\ncommon, calling for improved approaches to handle uncertainty in language\nunderstanding.

However, current\nbenchmarks face two key challenges: (1) they cannot directly assess multimodal\nreal-world planning capabilities, and (2) they lack constraints or implicit\nconstraints across modalities. To address these issues, we introduce Multimodal\nPlanning with Complex Constraints (MPCC), the first benchmark to systematically\nevaluate MLLMs' ability to handle multimodal constraints in planning. To\naddress the first challenge, MPCC focuses on three real-world tasks: Flight\nPlanning, Calendar Planning, and Meeting Planning.

In this work, we propose Causal2Vec, a general-purpose\nembedding model tailored to enhance the performance of decoder-only LLMs\nwithout altering their original architectures or introducing significant\ncomputational overhead. Specifically, we first employ a lightweight BERT-style\nmodel to pre-encode the input text into a single Contextual token, which is\nthen prepended to the LLM's input sequence, allowing each token to capture\ncontextualized information even without attending to future tokens.\nFurthermore, to mitigate the recency bias introduced by last-token pooling and\nhelp LLMs better leverage the semantic information encoded in the Contextual\ntoken, we concatenate the last hidden states of Contextual and EOS tokens as\nthe final text embedding. In practice, Causal2Vec achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on the Massive Text Embeddings Benchmark (MTEB) among models\ntrained solely on publicly available retrieval datasets, while reducing the\nrequired sequence length by up to 85% and inference time by up to 82% compared\nto best-performing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCausal2Vec\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u53cctoken\u6c60\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u5f81", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u53bb\u9664\u56e0\u679c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a9\u7801\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u4e49\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u5355\u5411\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u989d\u5916\u8f93\u5165\u589e\u52a0\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cfBERT\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u751f\u6210Contextual token\u4f5c\u4e3a\u524d\u7f00 2. \u62fc\u63a5Contextual\u548cEOS\u7684\u6700\u7ec8\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165", "result": "\u5728MTEB\u57fa\u51c6\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c1185%\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u548c82%\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4", "conclusion": "Causal2Vec\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u59cb\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u5f81\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387"}}

Additionally, current methods rely\nheavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which can cause models to memorize\nexisting problem-solving pathways, thereby restricting their generalization\nability when confronted with novel problem contexts. Furthermore, while some\nstudies have explored to improve retrieval-augmented reasoning in general\ndomains via reinforcement learning, their reward function designs do not\nadequately capture the specific demands of the medical domain. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce **Med-R$^3$**, a **Med**ical **R**etrieval-augmented\n**R**easoning framework driven by progressive **R**einforcement learning.

Recently, agent-based\nframeworks such as SWE-agent have further advanced this progress by enabling\nautonomous, tool-using agents to tackle complex software engineering tasks.\nWhile existing agent-based issue resolution approaches are primarily based on\nagents' independent explorations, they often get stuck in local solutions and\nfail to identify issue patterns that span across different parts of the\ncodebase. To address this limitation, we propose SWE-Debate, a competitive\nmulti-agent debate framework that encourages diverse reasoning paths and\nachieves more consolidated issue localization. SWE-Debate first creates\nmultiple fault propagation traces as localization proposals by traversing a\ncode dependency graph. Then, it organizes a three-round debate among\nspecialized agents, each embodying distinct reasoning perspectives along the\nfault propagation trace.

Conducting such trials typically demands\nsignificant financial investment and meticulous planning, highlighting the need\nfor accurate predictions of trial outcomes. Accurately predicting patient\nenrollment, a key factor in trial success, is one of the primary challenges\nduring the planning phase. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning-based\nmethod to address this critical challenge. Our method, implemented as a neural\nnetwork model, leverages pre-trained language models (PLMs) to capture the\ncomplexities and nuances of clinical documents, transforming them into\nexpressive representations. These representations are then combined with\nencoded tabular features via an attention mechanism.
