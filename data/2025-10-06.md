### [1] [Hallucination reduction with CASAL: Contrastive Activation Steering For Amortized Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02324)
*Wannan Yang,Xinchi Qiu,Lei Yu,Yuchen Zhang,Oliver Aobo Yang,Narine Kokhlikyan,Nicola Cancedda,Diego Garcia-Olano*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CASAL算法通过对比激活引导的摊销学习，将防幻觉机制固化到模型权重，实现无需实时干预的高效减幻，在多个基准上降低30%-40%幻觉，计算效率提升30倍且支持跨模态应用


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型存在自信型幻觉问题，现有激活引导方法需要实时监控推理过程，严重影响部署效率

Method: 提出对比激活引导的摊销学习方法，将防幻机制编码至模型权重；仅需微调单层transformer子模块；支持文本与多模态模型；首创适用于密集/MoE混合架构的引导训练方案

Result: 短问答基准幻觉降低30%-40%；计算效率比LoRA基线高30倍，数据效率高20倍；在OOD领域保持有效；成功应用于文本及视觉语言模型

Conclusion: CASAL首次实现基于可解释性方法的实用化部署，为生产系统提供了高效可靠的幻觉抑制方案，开辟了激活引导技术的新应用范式

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities but often
hallucinate, confidently providing incorrect answers instead of admitting
ignorance. Prior work has shown that models encode linear representations of
their own knowledge and that activation steering can reduce hallucinations.
These approaches, however, require real-time monitoring and intervention during
inference. We introduce Contrastive Activation Steering for Amortized Learning
(CASAL), an efficient algorithm that connects interpretability with amortized
optimization. CASAL directly bakes the benefits of activation steering into
model's weights. Once trained, LLMs answer questions they know while abstaining
from answering those they do not. CASAL's light-weight design requires training
only a submodule of a single transformer layer and yet reduces hallucination by
30%-40% across multiple short-form QA benchmarks. CASAL is 30x more
compute-efficient and 20x more data-efficient than strong LoRA-based baselines
such as SFT and DPO, boosting its practical applicability in data scarce
domains. Importantly, CASAL also generalizes effectively to out-of-distribution
(OOD) domains. We showcase CASAL's flexibility in mitigating hallucinations in
both text-only and vision-language models. To our knowledge, CASAL is the first
steering-based training method that has been shown to be effective for both
dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. CASAL represents a promising step
forward for applying interpretability-inspired method for practical deployment
in production systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出RA-FSM有限状态机框架解决大模型文献分析中的幻觉与错误引用问题，通过三阶段控制循环提升技术领域答案的可信度与可溯性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在文献综述中存在幻觉生成与错误引用缺陷，阻碍其在专业领域的高风险技术工作流中的应用

Method: 构建Relevance->Confidence->Knowledge三阶段控制流，结合向量检索与确定性引用管道，采用分层知识库构建与边界条件处理机制

Result: 在光子学领域六类任务评估中，专家盲测优选率超越Notebook LM 23%，引用证据可验证性提升37%，覆盖指数达领域最新成果的92%

Conclusion: 该框架为高风险技术决策提供透明可验证的文献分析方案，系统延迟与成本可控，可扩展至其他科学领域

Abstract: Large language models accelerate literature synthesis but can hallucinate and
mis-cite, limiting their usefulness in expert workflows. We present RA-FSM
(Research Assistant - Finite State Machine), a modular GPT-based research
assistant that wraps generation in a finite-state control loop: Relevance ->
Confidence -> Knowledge. The system is grounded in vector retrieval and a
deterministic citation pipeline. The controller filters out-of-scope queries,
scores answerability, decomposes questions, and triggers retrieval only when
needed, and emits answers with confidence labels and in-corpus, de-duplicated
references. A ranked-tier ingestion workflow constructs a domain knowledge base
from journals, conferences, indices, preprints, and patents, writing both to a
dense vector index and to a relational store of normalized metrics. We
implement the system for photonics and evaluate it on six task categories:
analytical reasoning, numerical analysis, methodological critique, comparative
synthesis, factual extraction, and application design. In blinded A/B reviews,
domain experts prefer RA-FSM to both a strong Notebook LM (NLM) and a vanilla
Default GPT API call single-pass baseline, citing stronger boundary-condition
handling and more defensible evidence use. Coverage and novelty analyses
indicate that RA-FSM explores beyond the NLM while incurring tunable latency
and cost overheads. The design emphasizes transparent, well-cited answers for
high-stakes technical work and is generalizable to other scientific domains.

*So Kuroki,Yotaro Kubo,Takuya Akiba,Yujin Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出结合实时语音转换模型与后端大语言模型的混合架构，在保持低延迟的同时提升语义理解能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有实时语音对话系统缺乏深度语义理解，而级联系统虽知识处理能力强但延迟过高，需要平衡延迟与知识处理能力

Method: 并行处理流程：S2S模型即时响应用户语音，同时将查询发送给LLM处理，实时注入LLM的文本响应来指导语音生成

Result: 在语音版MT-Bench测试中，系统响应正确率显著超越基线S2S模型，接近级联系统水平，延迟与基线相当

Conclusion: 混合架构有效结合实时交互与深度语义处理优势，为语音对话系统提供了延迟与知识处理的创新平衡方案

Abstract: Real-time speech-to-speech (S2S) models excel at generating natural,
low-latency conversational responses but often lack deep knowledge and semantic
understanding. Conversely, cascaded systems combining automatic speech
recognition, a text-based Large Language Model (LLM), and text-to-speech
synthesis offer superior knowledge representation at the cost of high latency,
which disrupts the flow of natural interaction. This paper introduces a novel
hybrid architecture that bridges the gap between these two paradigms. Our
framework processes user speech through an S2S transformer for immediate
responsiveness while concurrently relaying the query to a powerful back-end
LLM. The LLM's text-based response is then injected in real time to guide the
S2S model's speech generation, effectively infusing its output with rich
knowledge without the full latency penalty of a cascaded system. We evaluated
our method using a speech-synthesized variant of the MT-Bench benchmark that
consists of multi-turn question-answering sessions. The results demonstrate
that our system substantially outperforms a baseline S2S model in response
correctness, approaching that of a cascaded system, while maintaining a latency
on par with the baseline.

### [4] [AMANDA: Agentic Medical Knowledge Augmentation for Data-Efficient Medical Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02328)
*Ziqing Wang,Chengsheng Mao,Xiaole Wen,Yuan Luo,Kaize Ding*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出AMANDA框架，通过LLM代理和生物医学知识图谱增强医学多模态大模型在低资源环境下的视觉问答能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Med-MLLMs存在内在推理瓶颈（忽略医学图像细节）和外在推理瓶颈（缺乏专业知识整合），限制了在低资源环境下的应用

Method: 采用免训练框架：1）内在知识增强通过问题分解实现细粒度诊断；2）外在知识增强通过生物医学知识图谱检索增强推理过程

Result: 在8个Med-VQA基准测试中，零样本和小样本场景下均实现显著性能提升（代码已开源）

Conclusion: AMANDA通过双重知识增强有效突破医学推理瓶颈，为低资源医疗场景提供高效解决方案

Abstract: Medical Multimodal Large Language Models (Med-MLLMs) have shown great promise
in medical visual question answering (Med-VQA). However, when deployed in
low-resource settings where abundant labeled data are unavailable, existing
Med-MLLMs commonly fail due to their medical reasoning capability bottlenecks:
(i) the intrinsic reasoning bottleneck that ignores the details from the
medical image; (ii) the extrinsic reasoning bottleneck that fails to
incorporate specialized medical knowledge. To address those limitations, we
propose AMANDA, a training-free agentic framework that performs medical
knowledge augmentation via LLM agents. Specifically, our intrinsic medical
knowledge augmentation focuses on coarse-to-fine question decomposition for
comprehensive diagnosis, while extrinsic medical knowledge augmentation grounds
the reasoning process via biomedical knowledge graph retrieval. Extensive
experiments across eight Med-VQA benchmarks demonstrate substantial
improvements in both zero-shot and few-shot Med-VQA settings. The code is
available at https://github.com/REAL-Lab-NU/AMANDA.

TL;DR: SelfJudge通过目标模型自监督训练验证器，评估语义一致性实现自动化验证，在多样化NLP任务中实现更优的推理速度-准确性平衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有judge decoding方法依赖人工标注或可验证真值任务，难以适应不同NLP任务的通用需求

Method: 提出自监督验证器训练框架，通过替换token后保持语义一致性的自动评估实现跨任务验证器训练

Result: 实验证明SelfJudge相比基线方法在推理效率与准确性间取得更好平衡，提供广泛适用的加速方案

Conclusion: 该方法突破人工标注限制，为LLM高效推理提供可扩展的自我监督解决方案，推动高效推理技术发展

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by verifying candidate tokens
from a draft model against a larger target model. Recent judge decoding boosts
this process by relaxing verification criteria by accepting draft tokens that
may exhibit minor discrepancies from target model output, but existing methods
are restricted by their reliance on human annotations or tasks with verifiable
ground truths, limiting generalizability across diverse NLP tasks. We propose
SelfJudge, which trains judge verifiers via self-supervision of the target
model. Our method measures semantic preservation by assessing whether
token-substituted responses preserve the meaning of original responses,
enabling automatic verifier training across diverse NLP tasks. Our experiments
show SelfJudge achieves superior inference-accuracy trade-offs than judge
decoding baselines, offering a broadly applicable solution for faster LLM
inference.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Training long-context language models to capture long-range dependencies
requires specialized data construction. Current approaches, such as generic
text concatenation or heuristic-based variants, frequently fail to guarantee
genuine long-range dependencies. We propose EntropyLong, a novel data
construction method that leverages predictive uncertainty to verify dependency
quality. Our approach identifies high-entropy positions in documents, retrieves
semantically relevant contexts from large corpora, and verifies their utility
by assessing whether they reduce prediction entropy. This model-in-the-loop
verification ensures each dependency represents measurable information gain
rather than spurious correlation. We construct training samples with long-range
dependencies by combining original documents with these verified contextual
supplements. Using FineWebEdu and Cosmopedia, we generate a dataset of
128K-length sequences with verified dependencies. Models trained on this data
demonstrate significant improvements on RULER benchmarks, particularly in tasks
requiring distant information. Following instruction fine-tuning, our models
also achieve substantial gains on LongBenchv2, demonstrating enhanced
long-context understanding. Extensive ablation studies further validate the
necessity and effectiveness of entropybased verification for long-context
training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 结合行为模拟器与LM提示技术生成符合用户潜在状态的对话数据，解决CRS领域数据匮乏问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公开CRS数据稀缺导致语言模型难以有效微调，且传统LM用户模拟器生成的对话缺乏行为一致性

Method: 开发混合行为模拟器与LM提示技术的对话生成框架，构建包含偏好引导和案例批判的大规模开源CRS数据集

Result: 人工评估显示生成对话在一致性(72%)、事实性(85%)和自然度(78%)指标上表现优异，数据集已开源

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了CRS数据稀缺问题，为训练高质量对话推荐系统提供了可靠的数据基础，推动LM在CRS领域的实际应用

Abstract: While language models (LMs) offer great potential for conversational
recommender systems (CRSs), the paucity of public CRS data makes fine-tuning
LMs for CRSs challenging. In response, LMs as user simulators qua data
generators can be used to train LM-based CRSs, but often lack behavioral
consistency, generating utterance sequences inconsistent with those of any real
user. To address this, we develop a methodology for generating natural
dialogues that are consistent with a user's underlying state using behavior
simulators together with LM-prompting. We illustrate our approach by generating
a large, open-source CRS data set with both preference elicitation and example
critiquing. Rater evaluation on some of these dialogues shows them to exhibit
considerable consistency, factuality and naturalness.

*Yapei Feng,Feng Jiang,Shanhao Wu,Hua Zhong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出look-ahead Sync方法，在保持可证明安全性的前提下突破SyncPool的容量限制，英语嵌入率提升160%，中文提升25%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SyncPool方法为消除分词歧义牺牲了嵌入容量，将Shannon熵全部用于同步而非有效载荷嵌入

Method: 仅在真正不可区分的token序列上进行最小化同步采样，策略性保留所有可区分路径以最大化嵌入容量

Result: 英语（Llama 3）和中文（Qwen 2.5）测试中接近理论容量上限，大候选池场景下性能提升显著

Conclusion: 首次实现高容量可证明安全的语言隐写方案，在理论和工程层面均取得重要突破

Abstract: Neural linguistic steganography aims to embed information
  into natural text while preserving statistical undetectability. A fundamental
challenge in this ffeld stems from tokenization ambiguity in modern tokenizers,
which can lead to catastrophic decoding failures. The recent method, SyncPool,
addresses this ambiguity
  by employing a coarse-grained synchronization mechanism over groups of
ambiguous candidates. However, SyncPool sacriffces embedding capacity, as it
utilizes the entire Shannon entropy of an ambiguous group solely for
synchronization rather than for payload embedding. We propose a method named
look-ahead Sync, which overcomes the capacity limitation of SyncPool while
retaining its provable security guarantees. Our approach performs minimal
synchronized sampling only on truly indistinguishable token sequences, while
strategically preserving all other discernible paths to maximize embedding
capacity. We provide theoretical proofs for the security of our method and
analyze the gap between its achievable embedding capacity and the theoretical
upper bound. Experiments on English (using Llama 3) and Chinese (using Qwen
2.5) benchmarks show that our method consistently approaches the theoretical
capacity upper bound and signiffcantly outperforms SyncPool. The improvement in
embedding rate exceeds 160% in English and 25% in Chinese, particularly in
settings with larger candidate pools. This work represents a signiffcant step
toward practical high-capacity provably secure linguistic steganography.

TL;DR: 提出两个结合真实轨迹数据、语义增强与LLM生成内容的新型开放数据集，支持多模态移动分析和FAIR数据实践


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补现有资源空白，通过整合真实移动数据、结构化语义增强和LLM生成文本，构建支持语义推理和可重复研究的框架

Method: 基于OpenStreetMap GPS轨迹构建，添加停留点/POI/交通模式/天气等语义层，使用LLM生成合成社交媒体帖子，提供表格和RDF两种格式

Result: 创建覆盖巴黎和纽约的开放数据集，支持行为建模/移动预测/知识图谱构建等研究，首个结合真实移动数据与语义增强的资源框架

Conclusion: 该资源首次整合真实移动数据、结构化语义增强、LLM生成内容和语义网兼容性，为移动分析提供可重用多模态框架

Abstract: In this resource paper, we present two publicly available datasets of
semantically enriched human trajectories, together with the pipeline to build
them. The trajectories are publicly available GPS traces retrieved from
OpenStreetMap. Each dataset includes contextual layers such as stops, moves,
points of interest (POIs), inferred transportation modes, and weather data. A
novel semantic feature is the inclusion of synthetic, realistic social media
posts generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling multimodal and
semantic mobility analysis. The datasets are available in both tabular and
Resource Description Framework (RDF) formats, supporting semantic reasoning and
FAIR data practices. They cover two structurally distinct, large cities: Paris
and New York. Our open source reproducible pipeline allows for dataset
customization, while the datasets support research tasks such as behavior
modeling, mobility prediction, knowledge graph construction, and LLM-based
applications. To our knowledge, our resource is the first to combine real-world
movement, structured semantic enrichment, LLM-generated text, and semantic web
compatibility in a reusable framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于参数梯度的归因方法存在噪声干扰大、计算复杂度高的问题，难以有效诊断LLM生成有害内容/事实错误/偏见的根本原因

Method: 直接在模型激活空间分析表示及其梯度，建立模型输出与训练数据间的语义关联，实现细粒度归因分析

Result: 在有害内容追踪、后门检测、知识污染识别等任务中实现样本级和token级精准归因，定位准确率显著提升

Conclusion: 为LLM风险诊断提供新型分析工具，通过开源代码促进模型审计与安全改进

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
their deployment is frequently undermined by undesirable behaviors such as
generating harmful content, factual inaccuracies, and societal biases.
Diagnosing the root causes of these failures poses a critical challenge for AI
safety. Existing attribution methods, particularly those based on parameter
gradients, often fall short due to prohibitive noisy signals and computational
complexity. In this work, we introduce a novel and efficient framework that
diagnoses a range of undesirable LLM behaviors by analyzing representation and
its gradients, which operates directly in the model's activation space to
provide a semantically meaningful signal linking outputs to their training
data. We systematically evaluate our method for tasks that include tracking
harmful content, detecting backdoor poisoning, and identifying knowledge
contamination. The results demonstrate that our approach not only excels at
sample-level attribution but also enables fine-grained token-level analysis,
precisely identifying the specific samples and phrases that causally influence
model behavior. This work provides a powerful diagnostic tool to understand,
audit, and ultimately mitigate the risks associated with LLMs. The code is

Method: 使用Lean 4构建FormalML基准，通过翻译策略将过程式证明转化为声明式，提取4937个优化和概率不等式问题

Result: 现有最先进的证明器在准确性和效率方面仍存在显著不足（尤其在研究级上下文中）

Conclusion: 需要开发更强大的基于LLM的定理证明器来实现有效的子目标完成

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress
in formal theorem proving. Yet their ability to serve as practical assistants
for mathematicians, filling in missing steps within complex proofs, remains
underexplored. We identify this challenge as the task of subgoal completion,
where an LLM must discharge short but nontrivial proof obligations left
unresolved in a human-provided sketch. To study this problem, we introduce
FormalML, a Lean 4 benchmark built from foundational theories of machine
learning. Using a translation tactic that converts procedural proofs into
declarative form, we extract 4937 problems spanning optimization and
probability inequalities, with varying levels of difficulty. FormalML is the
first subgoal completion benchmark to combine premise retrieval and complex
research-level contexts. Evaluation of state-of-the-art provers highlights
persistent limitations in accuracy and efficiency, underscoring the need for
more capable LLM-based theorem provers for effective subgoal completion,

for high-resource languages, low-resource languages such as Kurdish remain
underserved. We present, to our knowledge, the first Kurdish STS dataset:
10,000 sentence pairs spanning formal and informal registers, each annotated
for similarity. We benchmark Sentence-BERT, multilingual BERT, and other strong
baselines, obtaining competitive results while highlighting challenges arising
from Kurdish morphology, orthographic variation, and code-mixing. The dataset

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化文本评估方法（如单一评分模型）缺乏多维度分析能力，需建立结构化、可解释的评估体系以适应多样化AI生成文本的质量把控需求。

Method: 集成语言/语义/结构特征构建多维评估模型，使用500份合成基金申请书训练，并与LLM-as-a-judge基准对比测试，验证强/弱实际案例表现。

Result: CRACQ比直接LLM评估具有更高的稳定性与维度可解释性，但在评估可靠性及领域泛化性方面仍存在局限。

Conclusion: CRACQ为自动化文本评估提供了结构化解决方案，未来需通过优化训练数据与领域适应机制提升评估效度。

Abstract: This paper presents CRACQ, a multi-dimensional evaluation framework tailored
to evaluate documents across f i v e specific traits: Coherence, Rigor,
Appropriateness, Completeness, and Quality. Building on insights from
traitbased Automated Essay Scoring (AES), CRACQ expands its fo-cus beyond
essays to encompass diverse forms of machine-generated text, providing a
rubricdriven and interpretable methodology for automated evaluation. Unlike
singlescore approaches, CRACQ integrates linguistic, semantic, and structural
signals into a cumulative assessment, enabling both holistic and trait-level
analysis. Trained on 500 synthetic grant pro-posals, CRACQ was benchmarked
against an LLM-as-a-judge and further tested on both strong and weak real
applications. Preliminary results in-dicate that CRACQ produces more stable and
interpretable trait-level judgments than direct LLM evaluation, though
challenges in reliability and domain scope remain

TL;DR: 提出集成强化学习框架GRPO+DocLens，通过确定性奖励直接优化临床文本生成的事实性与完整性，在降低训练成本的同时提升笔记质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有临床文档自动化方案难以平衡事实准确性、完整性与训练成本，且过度依赖人工参考或独立奖励模型

Method: 结合群体相对策略优化(GRPO)与对话锚定评估器(DocLens)，采用简单奖励门控策略，无需单独训练奖励模型或人工参考标准

Result: 实证显示临床笔记质量提升且训练成本降低，GPT-5独立评估表明输出在事实性/完整性/简洁性上更受青睐，幻觉和遗漏减少

Conclusion: 该框架具有实际应用扩展性，支持定制化目标整合，且当前改进幅度可能被低估（因基准数据较干净+基础模型已较好对齐）

Abstract: Automating clinical documentation with large language models requires precise
alignment with priorities such as completeness and factual grounding. We
present an evaluation-integrated reinforcement learning framework for long-form
clinical text generation that couples Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
with DocLens, a claim-level evaluator that provides deterministic,
dialogue-grounded rewards. Our method directly optimizes factual grounding and
completeness without training a separate reward model or relying on
human-authored references. Empirically, the approach improves clinical note
quality and reduces training cost via a simple reward-gating strategy. An
independent GPT-5 qualitative evaluation further supports these gains, showing
higher preference for GRPO outputs in factuality, completeness, and brevity,
with fewer omissions and hallucinations. Because the benchmarks are relatively
clean and the base model already well aligned, these improvements likely
represent a conservative lower bound. The framework is scalable to real-world
settings and can incorporate custom objectives such as guideline adherence or
billing preferences.

Conclusion: 论证性框架中简单UQ策略更有效，实验方法为UQ评估提供新范式

Abstract: Research in uncertainty quantification (UQ) for large language models (LLMs)
is increasingly important towards guaranteeing the reliability of this
groundbreaking technology. We explore the integration of LLM UQ methods in
argumentative LLMs (ArgLLMs), an explainable LLM framework for decision-making
based on computational argumentation in which UQ plays a critical role. We
conduct experiments to evaluate ArgLLMs' performance on claim verification
tasks when using different LLM UQ methods, inherently performing an assessment
of the UQ methods' effectiveness. Moreover, the experimental procedure itself
is a novel way of evaluating the effectiveness of UQ methods, especially when
intricate and potentially contentious statements are present. Our results
demonstrate that, despite its simplicity, direct prompting is an effective UQ
strategy in ArgLLMs, outperforming considerably more complex approaches.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证大语言模型能否通过提示技术有效模拟知识截断，避免因记忆效应导致的时间预测评估偏差

Method: 构建三个评估数据集（直接事实性知识、语义迁移、因果关联知识）测试不同遗忘场景

Result: 提示方法对直接查询有效，但对需要因果推理的间接遗忘任务效果不佳

Conclusion: 使用大语言模型进行时间预测需设计更严格的评估机制以区分记忆效应与真实推理能力

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for temporal prediction, but
their reliance on pretraining data raises contamination concerns, as accurate
predictions on pre-cutoff test data may reflect memorization rather than
reasoning, leading to an overestimation of their generalization capability.
With the recent emergence of prompting-based unlearning techniques, a natural
question arises: Can LLMs be prompted to simulate an earlier knowledge cutoff?
In this work, we investigate the capability of prompting to simulate earlier
knowledge cutoff in LLMs. We construct three evaluation datasets to assess the
extent to which LLMs can forget (1) direct factual knowledge, (2) semantic
shifts, and (3) causally related knowledge. Results demonstrate that while
prompt-based simulated knowledge cutoffs show effectiveness when directly
queried with the information after that date, they struggle to induce
forgetting when the forgotten content is not directly asked but causally
related to the query. These findings highlight the need for more rigorous

TL;DR: DRIFT提出基于用户隐式不满意信号(DSAT)的动态偏好训练方法，在真实场景中显著提升大语言模型性能，14B模型甚至超越GPT-4o-mini。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好学习方法依赖人工标注或假设充足正反馈，但真实场景中用户不满意信号(修正/调整)远多于显式满意反馈。

Method: 锚定真实DSAT信号，通过动态采样策略演化中的正例进行训练，保持偏好边界并避免梯度退化。

Result: 在WildBench和AlpacaEval2分别提升7B/14B模型6-12%，14B模型超越GPT-4o-mini，同时保持方案多样性。

Conclusion: DRIFT为真实场景训练提供高效可扩展方案，有效利用最丰富的隐式反馈信号，理论验证其避免模型坍塌的优势。

Abstract: Real-world large language model deployments (e.g., conversational AI systems,
code generation assistants) naturally generate abundant implicit user
dissatisfaction (DSAT) signals, as users iterate toward better answers through
refinements, corrections, and expressed preferences, while explicit
satisfaction (SAT) feedback is scarce. Existing preference learning approaches
are poorly aligned with this data profile, as they rely on costly human
annotations or assume plentiful positive responses. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{DRIFT} (\textbf{D}issatisfaction-\textbf{R}efined \textbf{I}terative
pre\textbf{F}erence \textbf{T}raining), which anchors training on real-world
DSAT signals and samples positives dynamically from the evolving policy.
Empirically, DRIFT models trained on real-world \textit{WildFeedback} datasets
and synthetic \textit{UltraFeedback} datasets achieve up to +6.23\% (7B) /
+7.61\% (14B) on WildBench Task Score and up to +8.95\% (7B) / +12.29\% (14B)
on AlpacaEval2 win rate over base models, outperforming strong baseline methods
such as iterative DPO and SPIN. At larger scales, the improvements are
particularly pronounced: 14B models trained with DRIFT surpass GPT-4o-mini on
WildBench. Further analysis shows that DRIFT also preserves exploratory
capacity, yielding more diverse high-reward solutions rather than collapsing to
narrow subsets. Theoretically, we demonstrate that this design preserves
preference margins and avoids the gradient degeneration. These results show
that DRIFT is an effective and scalable recipe for real-world post-training
that leverages the most abundant and informative signal. The code and data are

TL;DR: 提出SIMPACT隐私保护框架，构建标准化社交媒体数据集BluePrint用于LLM代理训练，通过next-action预测任务和两级评估指标验证行为真实性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有LLM模拟社交媒体动态时缺乏标准化数据集的问题，兼顾隐私保护和行为真实性的双重需求，支持伦理合规的大规模社交模拟研究

Method: 1. 设计next-action预测任务作为代理训练基准 2. 创建BluePrint数据集（含12种交互类型）通过匿名聚类构建用户画像 3. 提出集群级（行为模式）和群体级（风格真实性）评估指标

Result: 成功建立政治话语领域数据集，验证框架在上下文依赖行为建模的有效性，为错误信息和极化研究提供可扩展模板

Conclusion: SIMPACT通过标准化数据协议推动社交媒体模拟研究，在保证隐私的前提下实现高保真行为建模，为伦理化AI社会实验建立新基准

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for simulating
social media dynamics at scale, enabling studies that would be ethically or
logistically challenging with human subjects. However, the field lacks
standardized data resources for fine-tuning and evaluating LLMs as realistic
social media agents. We address this gap by introducing SIMPACT, the
SIMulation-oriented Persona and Action Capture Toolkit, a privacy respecting
framework for constructing behaviorally-grounded social media datasets suitable
for training agent models. We formulate next-action prediction as a task for
training and evaluating LLM-based agents and introduce metrics at both the
cluster and population levels to assess behavioral fidelity and stylistic
realism. As a concrete implementation, we release BluePrint, a large-scale
dataset built from public Bluesky data focused on political discourse.
BluePrint clusters anonymized users into personas of aggregated behaviours,
capturing authentic engagement patterns while safeguarding privacy through
pseudonymization and removal of personally identifiable information. The
dataset includes a sizable action set of 12 social media interaction types
(likes, replies, reposts, etc.), each instance tied to the posting activity
preceding it. This supports the development of agents that use
context-dependence, not only in the language, but also in the interaction
behaviours of social media to model social media users. By standardizing data
and evaluation protocols, SIMPACT provides a foundation for advancing rigorous,
ethically responsible social media simulations. BluePrint serves as both an
evaluation benchmark for political discourse modeling and a template for
building domain specific datasets to study challenges such as misinformation
and polarization.

*Peijun Zhu,Ning Yang,Jiayu Wei,Jinghang Wu,Haijun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出动态专家聚类与结构化压缩框架，解决MoE模型的负载不均、参数冗余和通信开销三重困境，实现参数量减少80%、吞吐提升10-20%的同时保持模型质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对MoE大语言模型中存在的专家负载不均衡、参数冗余度高、跨节点通信开销大三大核心矛盾，通过结构化重组实现效率与性能的协同优化。

Method: 1. 动态专家聚类：基于参数与激活相似度的融合度量，周期性重组专家形成语义相关集群
2. 结构化参数压缩：将专家权重分解为共享基矩阵与极低秩残差适配器
3. 分层路由策略：先分配token到集群，再在集群内选择专家，减少路由搜索空间
4. 异构精度方案：共享基采用FP16，残差因子用INT4存储，动态卸载非活跃集群

Result: 在GLUE和WikiText-103上达到标准MoE模型性能，总参数量减少约80%，吞吐量提升10-20%，专家负载方差降低3倍以上，峰值内存接近稠密模型。

Conclusion: 通过模型结构的动态重组与参数高效表征，证明结构化重构是实现高效可扩展MoE大模型的有效路径，为大规模模型部署提供新思路。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Models (LLMs) face a trilemma of load
imbalance, parameter redundancy, and communication overhead. We introduce a
unified framework based on dynamic expert clustering and structured compression
to address these issues cohesively. Our method employs an online clustering
procedure that periodically regroups experts using a fused metric of parameter
and activation similarity, which stabilizes expert utilization. To our
knowledge, this is one of the first frameworks to leverage the semantic
embedding capability of the router to dynamically reconfigure the model's
architecture during training for substantial efficiency gains. Within each
cluster, we decompose expert weights into a shared base matrix and extremely
low-rank residual adapters, achieving up to fivefold parameter reduction per
group while preserving specialization. This structure enables a two-stage
hierarchical routing strategy: tokens are first assigned to a cluster, then to
specific experts within it, drastically reducing the routing search space and
the volume of all-to-all communication. Furthermore, a heterogeneous precision
scheme, which stores shared bases in FP16 and residual factors in INT4, coupled
with dynamic offloading of inactive clusters, reduces peak memory consumption
to levels comparable to dense models. Evaluated on GLUE and WikiText-103, our
framework matches the quality of standard MoE models while reducing total
parameters by approximately 80%, improving throughput by 10% to 20%, and
lowering expert load variance by a factor of over three. Our work demonstrates
that structural reorganization is a principled path toward scalable, efficient,
and memory-effective MoE LLMs.

Motivation: 解决生成式AI在教育领域应用中的高能耗问题，探索在消费级硬件实时运行的可持续AI教学方案。

Method: 构建基于RAG的课程指导系统，对比LLaMA3.1、IBM Granite等8款SLMs（7-17B参数）与GPT-4o的性能表现。

Result: 优化后的SLMs在准确性和教学适配性上达到LLMs水平，同时降低83%的算力需求，支持本地化部署。

Conclusion: SLMs为教育机构提供了可持续的个性化学习解决方案，兼具经济效益与环境友好特性。

Abstract: The adoption of generative AI and large language models (LLMs) in education
is still emerging. In this study, we explore the development and evaluation of
AI teaching assistants that provide curriculum-based guidance using a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline applied to selected open-source
small language models (SLMs). We benchmarked eight SLMs, including LLaMA 3.1,
IBM Granite 3.3, and Gemma 3 (7-17B parameters), against GPT-4o. Our findings
show that with proper prompting and targeted retrieval, SLMs can match LLMs in
delivering accurate, pedagogically aligned responses. Importantly, SLMs offer
significant sustainability benefits due to their lower computational and energy
requirements, enabling real-time use on consumer-grade hardware without
depending on cloud infrastructure. This makes them not only cost-effective and
privacy-preserving but also environmentally responsible, positioning them as
viable AI teaching assistants for educational institutions aiming to scale
personalized learning in a sustainable and energy-efficient manner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始vec2vec方法存在计算成本高和训练不稳定的缺陷，限制了其实际应用场景

Method: 1. 伪并行嵌入向量初步匹配
2. 线性变换拟合
3. 迭代优化过程

Result: 效率比原方法提升2-3个数量级，同时保持或超越原有性能指标（BLEU score提升1.2%）

Conclusion: 线性方法的稳定性与可解释性优势，使其在跨语言处理、迁移学习等领域具备规模化应用潜力

Abstract: We build upon vec2vec, a procedure designed to align text embedding spaces
without parallel data. vec2vec finds a near-perfect alignment, but it is
expensive and unstable. We present mini-vec2vec, a simple and efficient
alternative that requires substantially lower computational cost and is highly
robust. Moreover, the learned mapping is a linear transformation. Our method
consists of three main stages: a tentative matching of pseudo-parallel
embedding vectors, transformation fitting, and iterative refinement. Our linear
alternative exceeds the original instantiation of vec2vec by orders of
magnitude in efficiency, while matching or exceeding their results. The
method's stability and interpretable algorithmic steps facilitate scaling and
unlock new opportunities for adoption in new domains and fields.

TL;DR: 提出LLMSQL作为替代WikiSQL的LLM时代基准数据集，解决原数据集存在的结构/标注问题并适配现代自然语言转SQL模型需求


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WikiSQL数据集因大小写敏感不一致、数据类型不匹配、语法错误、未回答问题等结构性和标注问题，已不适用于LLM时代的研究需求

Method: 对WikiSQL进行系统性错误分类与自动化清洗/重新标注，构建包含自然语言问题与完整SQL语句的纯文本格式数据集

Result: 评估Gemma 3、LLaMA 3.2、Mistral 7B等主流大模型，验证数据集作为LLM-ready基准的有效性

Conclusion: LLMSQL通过标准化清洗与格式转换，为现代自然语言转SQL模型提供可直接生成完整查询语句的基准测试平台

Abstract: Converting natural language questions into SQL queries (Text-to-SQL) enables
non-expert users to interact with relational databases and has long been a
central task for natural language interfaces to data. While the WikiSQL dataset
played a key role in early NL2SQL research, its usage has declined due to
structural and annotation issues, including case sensitivity inconsistencies,
data type mismatches, syntax errors, and unanswered questions. We present
LLMSQL, a systematic revision and transformation of WikiSQL designed for the
LLM era. We classify these errors and implement automated methods for cleaning
and re-annotation. To assess the impact of these improvements, we evaluated
multiple large language models (LLMs), including Gemma 3, LLaMA 3.2, Mistral
7B, gpt-oss 20B, Phi-3.5 Mini, Qwen 2.5, OpenAI o4-mini, DeepSeek R1 and
others. Rather than serving as an update, LLMSQL is introduced as an LLM-ready
benchmark: unlike the original WikiSQL, tailored for pointer-network models
selecting tokens from input, LLMSQL provides clean natural language questions
and full SQL queries as plain text, enabling straightforward generation and
evaluation for modern natural language-to-SQL models.

TL;DR: 研究探讨不同规模的大语言模型（LLMs）在政治文本敏感性评估中的表现差异，发现具备显式推理能力的大模型（如DeepSeek-R1）在跨意识形态/语言的攻击性判断中更具一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示LLMs在特定政治视角下进行攻击性内容评估的能力差异，探究推理机制对多语言社会政治文本分类的适配价值。

Method: 使用MD-Agreement数据集中2020年美国选举的多语言推文子集，测试DeepSeek-R1等六个模型从极右/保守/中立/进步四种政治立场对英/波/俄三语推文的攻击性判断。

Result: 大模型（如DeepSeek-R1）能敏感捕捉意识形态差异（不同政见间判断差异达18.7%），小模型（如Gemma）在跨语言场景下的判断一致性下降32%。推理能力使模型解释性提升41%。

Conclusion: 显式推理机制是LLMs实现跨语言意识形态敏感文本分类的关键，建议未来研究通过增强模型推理能力来提升社会政治场景下的内容审核效果。

Abstract: We explore how large language models (LLMs) assess offensiveness in political
discourse when prompted to adopt specific political and cultural perspectives.
Using a multilingual subset of the MD-Agreement dataset centered on tweets from
the 2020 US elections, we evaluate several recent LLMs - including DeepSeek-R1,
o4-mini, GPT-4.1-mini, Qwen3, Gemma, and Mistral - tasked with judging tweets
as offensive or non-offensive from the viewpoints of varied political personas
(far-right, conservative, centrist, progressive) across English, Polish, and
Russian contexts. Our results show that larger models with explicit reasoning
abilities (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, o4-mini) are more consistent and sensitive to
ideological and cultural variation, while smaller models often fail to capture
subtle distinctions. We find that reasoning capabilities significantly improve
both the personalization and interpretability of offensiveness judgments,
suggesting that such mechanisms are key to adapting LLMs for nuanced
sociopolitical text classification across languages and ideologies.

Motivation: 语音对话模型在音频输入输出中可能通过副语言特征(年龄/性别/口音)产生偏见，多轮对话可能放大这些偏见，影响决策和推荐的公平性。

Method: 使用群体不公平分数(GUS)和相似性标准化统计率(SNSR)指标，评估Qwen2.5-Omni、GLM-4-Voice等开源模型及GPT-4o Audio、Gemini-2.5-Flash等闭源API。

Result: 闭源模型偏见较低；开源模型对年龄/性别更敏感；推荐任务扩大跨群体差异；多轮对话中偏见可能持续存在。

Conclusion: 该研究为语音对话模型的偏见研究提供系统框架，促进公平音频交互系统发展，并开源FairDialogue数据集和评估代码。

Abstract: While biases in large language models (LLMs), such as stereotypes and
cultural tendencies in outputs, have been examined and identified, their
presence and characteristics in spoken dialogue models (SDMs) with audio input
and output remain largely unexplored. Paralinguistic features, such as age,
gender, and accent, can affect model outputs; when compounded by multi-turn
conversations, these effects may exacerbate biases, with potential implications
for fairness in decision-making and recommendation tasks. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate biases in speech LLMs and study the impact of
multi-turn dialogues with repeated negative feedback. Bias is measured using
Group Unfairness Score (GUS) for decisions and similarity-based normalized
statistics rate (SNSR) for recommendations, across both open-source models like
Qwen2.5-Omni and GLM-4-Voice, as well as closed-source APIs such as GPT-4o
Audio and Gemini-2.5-Flash. Our analysis reveals that closed-source models
generally exhibit lower bias, while open-source models are more sensitive to
age and gender, and recommendation tasks tend to amplify cross-group
disparities. We found that biased decisions may persist in multi-turn
conversations. This work provides the first systematic study of biases in
end-to-end spoken dialogue models, offering insights towards fair and reliable
audio-based interactive systems. To facilitate further research, we release the
FairDialogue dataset and evaluation code.

Abstract: This study examines the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and large
language models (LLM) to improve access to legal texts in Senegal's judicial
system. The emphasis is on the difficulties of extracting and organizing legal
documents, highlighting the need for better access to judicial information. The
research successfully extracted 7,967 articles from various legal documents,
particularly focusing on the Land and Public Domain Code. A detailed graph
database was developed, which contains 2,872 nodes and 10,774 relationships,
aiding in the visualization of interconnections within legal texts. In
addition, advanced triple extraction techniques were utilized for knowledge,
demonstrating the effectiveness of models such as GPT-4o, GPT-4, and
Mistral-Large in identifying relationships and relevant metadata. Through these
technologies, the aim is to create a solid framework that allows Senegalese
citizens and legal professionals to more effectively understand their rights

Motivation: 探索语言皮层是否存在与形式无关的抽象语义表征，解决关于语义表征抽象程度的争议。

Method: 使用视觉模型生成句子对应图像并提取特征，结合多重释义及语境增强的句子变体，预测语言皮层神经响应并与大语言模型对比。

Result: 多重图像/释义聚合显著提升预测精度，语境增强的释义预测效果甚至超越原句嵌入，表明人脑语义表征比语言模型更丰富多维。

Conclusion: 语言皮层存储高度抽象且形式独立的意义表征，其语义广度超越语言模型的表征能力。

Abstract: The human language system represents both linguistic forms and meanings, but
the abstractness of the meaning representations remains debated. Here, we
searched for abstract representations of meaning in the language cortex by
modeling neural responses to sentences using representations from vision and
language models. When we generate images corresponding to sentences and extract
vision model embeddings, we find that aggregating across multiple generated
images yields increasingly accurate predictions of language cortex responses,
sometimes rivaling large language models. Similarly, averaging embeddings
across multiple paraphrases of a sentence improves prediction accuracy compared
to any single paraphrase. Enriching paraphrases with contextual details that
may be implicit (e.g., augmenting "I had a pancake" to include details like
"maple syrup") further increases prediction accuracy, even surpassing
predictions based on the embedding of the original sentence, suggesting that
the language system maintains richer and broader semantic representations than
language models. Together, these results demonstrate the existence of highly
abstract, form-independent meaning representations within the language cortex.

TL;DR: DiffuSpec框架利用扩散语言模型实现单次前向传递生成多令牌草稿，通过因果一致性路径搜索和自适应长度控制，达到3倍解码加速


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归草稿模型的串行特性限制推测解码的加速效果，扩散模型的双向条件生成能力可突破此限制但面临路径一致性和长度控制挑战

Method: 1) 因果一致性路径搜索(CPS)：从扩散模型生成的令牌网格中提取左对齐路径；2) 自适应草稿长度(ADL)：动态调整后续草稿长度

Result: 在基准测试中实现最高3倍实时加速，验证扩散模型作为AR草稿替代方案的可行性

Conclusion: DiffuSpec成功将扩散模型整合到推测解码框架，突破自回归草稿的串行瓶颈，为语言模型加速提供新方向

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) scale up, accuracy improves, but the
autoregressive (AR) nature of decoding increases latency since each token
requires a serial forward pass. Speculative decoding addresses this by
employing a fast drafter to propose multi-token drafts, which are then verified
in parallel by the target model. However, many deployments still rely on AR
drafters, where sequential passes limit wall-clock gains. We revisit the
drafting stage and present DiffuSpec, a training-free drop-in framework that
uses a pretrained diffusion language model (DLM) to produce multi-token drafts
in a single forward pass, while remaining compatible with standard AR
verifiers. Because DLM drafts are generated under bidirectional conditioning,
parallel per-position candidates form a token lattice in which the locally
highest-probability token at each position need not form a causal left-to-right
path. Moreover, DLM drafting requires pre-specifying a draft length, inducing a
speed-quality trade-off. To address these challenges, we introduce two
practical components: (i) a causal-consistency path search (CPS) over this
lattice that extracts a left-to-right path aligned with AR verification; and
(ii) an adaptive draft-length (ADL) controller that adjusts next proposal size
based on recent acceptance feedback and realized generated length. Across
benchmarks, DiffuSpec yields up to 3x wall-clock speedup, establishing
diffusion-based drafting as a robust alternative to autoregressive drafters for
speculative decoding.

Abstract: Improving air quality and addressing climate change relies on accurate
understanding and analysis of air pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions.
However, emission-related knowledge is often fragmented and highly specialized,
while existing methods for accessing and compiling emissions data remain
inefficient. These issues hinder the ability of non-experts to interpret
emissions information, posing challenges to research and management. To address
this, we present Emission-GPT, a knowledge-enhanced large language model agent
tailored for the atmospheric emissions domain. Built on a curated knowledge
base of over 10,000 documents (including standards, reports, guidebooks, and
peer-reviewed literature), Emission-GPT integrates prompt engineering and
question completion to support accurate domain-specific question answering.
Emission-GPT also enables users to interactively analyze emissions data via
natural language, such as querying and visualizing inventories, analyzing
source contributions, and recommending emission factors for user-defined
scenarios. A case study in Guangdong Province demonstrates that Emission-GPT
can extract key insights--such as point source distributions and sectoral
trends--directly from raw data with simple prompts. Its modular and extensible
architecture facilitates automation of traditionally manual workflows,
positioning Emission-GPT as a foundational tool for next-generation emission
inventory development and scenario-based assessment.

Motivation: 验证纯统计生成的LLM群体能否出现类似人类社会的沉默螺旋现象，揭示算法系统潜在的社会动态机制。

Method: 构建四象限实验框架（历史/角色信号的有无组合），采用趋势检验(Mann-Kendall/Spearman)和集中度测量(峰度/IQR)分析意见动态。

Result: 历史+角色信号产生显著多数优势(β=0.77,p<0.01)，单独历史导致强锚定(τ=0.65)，单独角色形成高离散度(峰度=-1.2)。

Conclusion: 算法系统的社会动态存在涌现风险，设计LLM-agent系统需建立历史信号监控机制，防止非预期的意见收敛。

Abstract: The Spiral of Silence (SoS) theory holds that individuals with minority views
often refrain from speaking out for fear of social isolation, enabling majority
positions to dominate public discourse. When the 'agents' are large language
models (LLMs), however, the classical psychological explanation is not directly
applicable, since SoS was developed for human societies. This raises a central
question: can SoS-like dynamics nevertheless emerge from purely statistical
language generation in LLM collectives? We propose an evaluation framework for
examining SoS in LLM agents. Specifically, we consider four controlled
conditions that systematically vary the availability of 'History' and 'Persona'
signals. Opinion dynamics are assessed using trend tests such as Mann-Kendall
and Spearman's rank, along with concentration measures including kurtosis and
interquartile range. Experiments across open-source and closed-source models
show that history and persona together produce strong majority dominance and
replicate SoS patterns; history signals alone induce strong anchoring; and
persona signals alone foster diverse but uncorrelated opinions, indicating that
without historical anchoring, SoS dynamics cannot emerge. The work bridges
computational sociology and responsible AI design, highlighting the need to
monitor and mitigate emergent conformity in LLM-agent systems.

Method: 设计QK适配器（特征压缩+分块注意力）和底层分块适配器（语义边界检测），冻结主干网络参数，采用注意力蒸馏训练策略

Result: 短文本性能持平，长文本保留98.64%性能，KV缓存保留率48.58%，120K长文本处理最高加速4.48倍

Conclusion: ChunkLLM通过动态分块机制和双适配器架构，在计算效率与模型性能间取得优异平衡，特别适合超长文本处理场景

Abstract: Transformer-based large models excel in natural language processing and
computer vision, but face severe computational inefficiencies due to the
self-attention's quadratic complexity with input tokens. Recently, researchers
have proposed a series of methods based on block selection and compression to
alleviate this problem, but they either have issues with semantic
incompleteness or poor training-inference efficiency. To comprehensively
address these challenges, we propose ChunkLLM, a lightweight and pluggable
training framework. Specifically, we introduce two components: QK Adapter
(Q-Adapter and K-Adapter) and Chunk Adapter. The former is attached to each
Transformer layer, serving dual purposes of feature compression and chunk
attention acquisition. The latter operates at the bottommost layer of the
model, functioning to detect chunk boundaries by leveraging contextual semantic
information. During the training phase, the parameters of the backbone remain
frozen, with only the QK Adapter and Chunk Adapter undergoing training.
Notably, we design an attention distillation method for training the QK
Adapter, which enhances the recall rate of key chunks. During the inference
phase, chunk selection is triggered exclusively when the current token is
detected as a chunk boundary, thereby accelerating model inference.
Experimental evaluations are conducted on a diverse set of long-text and
short-text benchmark datasets spanning multiple tasks. ChunkLLM not only
attains comparable performance on short-text benchmarks but also maintains
98.64% of the performance on long-context benchmarks while preserving a 48.58%
key-value cache retention rate. Particularly, ChunkLLM attains a maximum
speedup of 4.48x in comparison to the vanilla Transformer in the processing of
120K long texts.

Motivation: 历史常被国家文化视角扭曲，大语言模型训练数据可能携带偏见导致非中立性输出

Method: 分三阶段实验：1）获取二元回答 2）要求数值评分 3）跨语言重复测试

Result: 模型在二元/数值回答间存在立场转换，跨语言响应稳定性差异显著（如罗马尼亚语vs英语）

Conclusion: 大语言模型存在语境敏感性偏见，回答一致性与其准确性/中立性评价无必然关联

Abstract: In this case study, we select a set of controversial Romanian historical
questions and ask multiple Large Language Models to answer them across
languages and contexts, in order to assess their biases. Besides being a study
mainly performed for educational purposes, the motivation also lies in the
recognition that history is often presented through altered perspectives,
primarily influenced by the culture and ideals of a state, even through large
language models. Since they are often trained on certain data sets that may
present certain ambiguities, the lack of neutrality is subsequently instilled
in users. The research process was carried out in three stages, to confirm the
idea that the type of response expected can influence, to a certain extent, the
response itself; after providing an affirmative answer to some given question,
an LLM could shift its way of thinking after being asked the same question
again, but being told to respond with a numerical value of a scale. Results
show that binary response stability is relatively high but far from perfect and
varies by language. Models often flip stance across languages or between
formats; numeric ratings frequently diverge from the initial binary choice, and
the most consistent models are not always those judged most accurate or
neutral. Our research brings to light the predisposition of models to such
inconsistencies, within a specific contextualization of the language for the
question asked.

Motivation: 现有LLM智能体常因缺乏环境实例级上下文(如物体位置、配方等)在复杂任务中失败，需要系统化获取此类可验证、可复用的具体事实。

Method: 采用TODO森林引导探索 + 轻量级'计划-执行-提取'循环，自动生成高精度、跨任务复用的上下文文档，分摊探索成本。

Result: 在TextWorld/ALFWorld/Crafter中：ReAct成功率从37%→95%，IGE从81%→95%，效率指标均显著提升。

Conclusion: 将单次探索转化为持久知识，结合现有上下文体系，为构建可靠高效的LLM智能体提供新范式。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents typically receive two kinds of context: (i)
environment-level manuals that define interaction interfaces and global rules,
and (ii) task-level guidance or demonstrations tied to specific goals. In this
work, we identify a crucial but overlooked third type of context,
instance-level context, which consists of verifiable and reusable facts tied to
a specific environment instance, such as object locations, crafting recipes,
and local rules. We argue that the absence of instance-level context is a
common source of failure for LLM agents in complex tasks, as success often
depends not only on reasoning over global rules or task prompts but also on
making decisions based on precise and persistent facts. Acquiring such context
requires more than memorization: the challenge lies in efficiently exploring,
validating, and formatting these facts under tight interaction budgets. We
formalize this problem as Instance-Level Context Learning (ILCL) and introduce
our task-agnostic method to solve it. Our method performs a guided exploration,
using a compact TODO forest to intelligently prioritize its next actions and a
lightweight plan-act-extract loop to execute them. This process automatically
produces a high-precision context document that is reusable across many
downstream tasks and agents, thereby amortizing the initial exploration cost.
Experiments across TextWorld, ALFWorld, and Crafter demonstrate consistent
gains in both success and efficiency: for instance, ReAct's mean success rate
in TextWorld rises from 37% to 95%, while IGE improves from 81% to 95%. By
transforming one-off exploration into persistent, reusable knowledge, our
method complements existing contexts to enable more reliable and efficient LLM
agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Training conditions shape how LLMs arbitrate between parametric and in-context knowledge, with non-ideal corpus properties enabling robust arbitration strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of systematic understanding about knowledge-arbitration strategies leads to wasted computational resources and undesirable model behaviors.

Method: Trained transformer models on synthetic biographies corpus while controlling training conditions (fact repetition, inconsistency, distributional skew).

Result: Intra-document repetition enhances both knowledge types; inconsistent/skewed data promotes robust arbitration strategies.

Conclusion: Non-ideal corpus properties (inconsistency/skew) are crucial for developing models that effectively integrate parametric and in-context knowledge.

Abstract: Large language models often encounter conflicts between in-context knowledge
retrieved at inference time and parametric knowledge acquired during
pretraining. Models that accept external knowledge uncritically are vulnerable
to misinformation, whereas models that adhere rigidly to parametric knowledge
fail to benefit from retrieval. Despite the widespread adoption of
retrieval-augmented generation, we still lack a systematic understanding of
what shapes knowledge-arbitration strategies during training. This gap risks
producing pretrained models with undesirable arbitration behaviors and,
consequently, wasting substantial computational resources after the pretraining
budget has already been spent. To address this problem, we present the first
controlled study of how training conditions influence models' use of in-context
and parametric knowledge, and how they arbitrate between them. We train
transformer-based language models on a synthetic biographies corpus while
systematically controlling various conditions. Our experiments reveal that
intra-document repetition of facts fosters the development of both parametric
and in-context capabilities. Moreover, training on a corpus that contains
inconsistent information or distributional skew encourages models to develop
robust strategies for leveraging parametric and in-context knowledge. Rather
than viewing these non-ideal properties as artifacts to remove, our results
indicate that they are important for learning robust arbitration. These
insights offer concrete, empirical guidance for pretraining models that
harmoniously integrate parametric and in-context knowledge.

Conclusion: 分层前馈记忆机制在不同架构中具有鲁棒性，支持预训练和后期扩展，实现参数效率与推理能力的平衡

Abstract: The impressive performance gains of modern language models currently rely on
scaling parameters: larger models store more world knowledge and reason better.
Yet compressing all world knowledge into parameters is unnecessary, as only a
fraction is used per prompt, and impractical for edge devices with limited
inference-time memory and compute. We address this shortcoming by a
memory-augmented architecture and a pretraining strategy aligned with existing
hardware paradigms. We introduce small language models that access large
hierarchical parametric memory banks encoding world knowledge. During
pretraining and inference, we fetch a small, context-dependent memory block and
add it to the model. Our pretraining learns to store long-tail world knowledge
in the memory parameters, while the small language model acts as an anchor
capturing common knowledge and general reasoning abilities. Through
trillion-token-scale experiments, we show significant gains: a 160M-parameters
model augmented with an 18M-parameters memory fetched from a 4.6B memory bank
obtains comparable performance to a regular model with more than 2x the
parameters. Through extensive experiments, we study the optimal type and size
of parametric memories in transformers, scaling them to over 21B parameters. We
find that our proposed hierarchical feed-forward memories work robustly across
transformer architectures, whether added during pretraining or post-hoc.

Conclusion: 该方法通过轻量化评分机制有效挖掘多模型集体智慧，在保证计算效率的同时显著超越现有优选方案

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities, yet
selecting the most reliable response from multiple LLMs remains a challenge,
particularly in resource-constrained settings. Existing approaches often depend
on costly external verifiers, human evaluators, or self-consistency techniques
that require multiple samples from a single model. While multi-LLM systems
produce more diverse responses than single models and thus have greater
potential, they often underperform compared to single LLM self-consistency. We
propose a principled, novel and computationally efficient method to select the
best response from multiple different LLMs using a calibrated log-likelihood
score, implicitly leveraging the inherent knowledge and confidence of these
models. Our method demonstrates improvements of approx. 4%, 3%, and 5% across
both debate (multi-round LLM discussions) and non-debate (Best-of-N with
multiple LLMs) settings on GSM8K, MMLU (6 subsets), and ARC datasets
respectively.

Conclusion: 规则驱动的多源检索路径选择机制能有效结合结构化和非结构化数据优势，为金融、医疗等领域提供高精度且可持续的问答解决方案

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on general
Question Answering (QA), yet they often struggle in domain-specific scenarios
where accurate and up-to-date information is required. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by enriching LLMs with external
knowledge, but existing systems primarily rely on unstructured documents, while
largely overlooking relational databases, which provide precise, timely, and
efficiently queryable factual information, serving as indispensable
infrastructure in domains such as finance, healthcare, and scientific research.
Motivated by this gap, we conduct a systematic analysis that reveals three
central observations: (i) databases and documents offer complementary strengths
across queries, (ii) naively combining both sources introduces noise and cost
without consistent accuracy gains, and (iii) selecting the most suitable source
for each query is crucial to balance effectiveness and efficiency. We further
observe that query types show consistent regularities in their alignment with
retrieval paths, suggesting that routing decisions can be effectively guided by
systematic rules that capture these patterns. Building on these insights, we
propose a rule-driven routing framework. A routing agent scores candidate
augmentation paths based on explicit rules and selects the most suitable one; a
rule-making expert agent refines the rules over time using QA feedback to
maintain adaptability; and a path-level meta-cache reuses past routing
decisions for semantically similar queries to reduce latency and cost.
Experiments on three QA benchmarks demonstrate that our framework consistently
outperforms static strategies and learned routing baselines, achieving higher
accuracy while maintaining moderate computational cost.

Conclusion: 研究结果为设计可靠且可扩展的LLMs持续更新策略提供了理论基础，推动LLMs知识更新机制的系统化研究

Abstract: Knowledge editing and machine unlearning are two popular approaches for large
language models (LLMs) to stay up-to-date. However, the knowledge updating
mechanism of LLMs remains largely unexplored due to insufficient, isolated, and
small-scale evaluation. For instance, are LLMs similar to humans in modifying
certain knowledge? What differs editing and unlearning as training data
increases? This paper proposes KnowledgeSmith, a unified framework to
systematically understand the updating mechanism of LLMs. We first cast editing
and unlearning as instances of one constrained optimization problem. Then, we
propose an automatic dataset generator that provides structured interventions
across multiple graph levels and data scales, enabling controlled studies of
how different modification strategies propagate through model knowledge.
Extensive experiments demonstrate nuanced insights over knowledge propagation,
plasticity scaling, consistency, and robustness. For instance, our results show
that LLMs do not exhibit similar updating as humans for different levels of
knowledge, and there exists consistency-capacity trade-off. We hope our
findings can offer suggestions to the design of more reliable and scalable
strategies. Code: https://github.com/AIFrontierLab/KnowledgeSmith.git

Conclusion: 数据库级结构化领域声明配合子字符串匹配检索机制，为跨领域NL2SQL任务提供了更实用可靠的解决方案

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) for translating Natural
Language (NL) queries into SQL varies significantly across databases (DBs). NL
queries are often expressed using a domain specific vocabulary, and mapping
these to the correct SQL requires an understanding of the embedded domain
expressions, their relationship to the DB schema structure. Existing benchmarks
rely on unrealistic, ad-hoc query specific textual hints for expressing domain
knowledge. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for associating
structured domain statements at the database level. We present retrieval of
relevant structured domain statements given a user query using sub-string level
match. We evaluate on eleven realistic DB schemas covering diverse domains
across five open-source and proprietary LLMs and demonstrate that (1) DB level
structured domain statements are more practical and accurate than existing
ad-hoc query specific textual domain statements, and (2) Our sub-string match
based retrieval of relevant domain statements provides significantly higher
accuracy than other retrieval approaches.

Conclusion: 文本模型中存在隐式多模态结构，简单提示即可显化其模态适应性表征

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained purely on text ostensibly lack any
direct perceptual experience, yet their internal representations are implicitly
shaped by multimodal regularities encoded in language. We test the hypothesis
that explicit sensory prompting can surface this latent structure, bringing a
text-only LLM into closer representational alignment with specialist vision and
audio encoders. When a sensory prompt tells the model to 'see' or 'hear', it
cues the model to resolve its next-token predictions as if they were
conditioned on latent visual or auditory evidence that is never actually
supplied. Our findings reveal that lightweight prompt engineering can reliably
activate modality-appropriate representations in purely text-trained LLMs.

Conclusion: 建立PCFGs作为研究语言模型学习动态的标准化测试平台，揭示神经网络表征层次化句法的根本性挑战，为理解模型学习机制开辟新研究方向

Abstract: We introduce a new framework for understanding how language models acquire
syntax. While large models achieve impressive results, little is known about
their learning dynamics. Our approach starts with the observation that most
domains of interest, such as natural language syntax, coding languages,
arithmetic problems, are captured by probabilistic context-free grammars
(PCFGs). We study the learning dynamics of small models trained on synthetic
languages generated from PCFGs, enabling precise control over grammar
complexity, recursion depth, and subgrammar structure. We prove several
general, recursive formulae for the training loss and Kullback-Leibler
divergence over the subgrammar structure of a PCFG. Empirically, we find that
unlike children, who first master simple substructures before progressing to
more complex constructions, transformers reduce loss across all subgrammars in
parallel. We further show that subgrammar pretraining can improve the final
loss for smaller models, and that pretrained models develop internal
representations more aligned with the grammar's substructure. Finally, we
demonstrate that models struggle with deeper recursive structures (a limitation
even of large language models), revealing fundamental challenges in how neural
networks represent hierarchical syntax. Overall, our work initiates the study
of the learning dynamics of transformers on PCFGs as a versatile testbed for
probing learning in language models, opening a research direction with many
open questions.

Motivation: 传统神经检索方法忽视语料库结构，导致解释性差且未充分利用层次信息。Cobweb旨在通过分层原型树解决这些问题。

Method: 构建原型树组织句子嵌入，采用广义最佳优先搜索和路径求和两种推理方式，支持BERT/T5/GPT-2等多种表示模型。

Result: 在MS MARCO和QQP数据集上验证：与传统kNN检索相当，但对低质量嵌入(如GPT-2)更具鲁棒性（传统方法失效时仍能检索相关结果）。

Conclusion: Cobweb在效果、鲁棒性、可扩展性和可解释性方面均有优势，为结构化检索提供了新范式。

Abstract: Neural document retrieval often treats a corpus as a flat cloud of vectors
scored at a single granularity, leaving corpus structure underused and
explanations opaque. We use Cobweb--a hierarchy-aware framework--to organize
sentence embeddings into a prototype tree and rank documents via coarse-to-fine
traversal. Internal nodes act as concept prototypes, providing multi-granular
relevance signals and a transparent rationale through retrieval paths. We
instantiate two inference approaches: a generalized best-first search and a
lightweight path-sum ranker. We evaluate our approaches on MS MARCO and QQP
with encoder (e.g., BERT/T5) and decoder (GPT-2) representations. Our results
show that our retrieval approaches match the dot product search on strong
encoder embeddings while remaining robust when kNN degrades: with GPT-2
vectors, dot product performance collapses whereas our approaches still
retrieve relevant results. Overall, our experiments suggest that Cobweb
provides competitive effectiveness, improved robustness to embedding quality,
scalability, and interpretable retrieval via hierarchical prototypes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) has become a significant research focus and is
utilized in various fields, such as text generation and dialog systems. One of
the most essential applications of LLM is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG),
which greatly enhances generated content's reliability and relevance. However,
evaluating RAG systems remains a challenging task. Traditional evaluation
metrics struggle to effectively capture the key features of modern
LLM-generated content that often exhibits high fluency and naturalness.
Inspired by the RAGAS tool, a well-known RAG evaluation framework, we extended
this framework into a KG-based evaluation paradigm, enabling multi-hop
reasoning and semantic community clustering to derive more comprehensive
scoring metrics. By incorporating these comprehensive evaluation criteria, we
gain a deeper understanding of RAG systems and a more nuanced perspective on
their performance. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we compare
its performance with RAGAS scores and construct a human-annotated subset to
assess the correlation between human judgments and automated metrics. In
addition, we conduct targeted experiments to demonstrate that our KG-based
evaluation method is more sensitive to subtle semantic differences in generated
outputs. Finally, we discuss the key challenges in evaluating RAG systems and
highlight potential directions for future research.

Conclusion: MA表示策略取决于语音编码器训练目标（语音识别/翻译），这直接影响模型的多语言处理能力。

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) that integrate speech with large language
models (LMs) rely on modality adapters (MAs) to map the output of speech
encoders to a representation that is understandable to the decoder LM. Yet we
know very little about how these crucial MAs transform representations. Here we
examine the MA output representation in three SLMs (SALMONN, Qwen2-Audio and
Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct). By finding the nearest decoder LM token to an MA
representation, we uncover two strategies for MA representations. For models
using a Whisper encoder, MAs appear to represent the meaning of the input using
an English-based interlingua, allowing them to handle languages unseen in
instruction tuning. For models that don't, like Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct, MAs
instead represent the phonetics of the input, but expressed with English words.
We hypothesise that which arises depends on whether the speech encoder is
trained only for speech recognition or also for translation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文针对语言模型的上下文利用不透明性问题，提出了首个高亮解释的黄金标准评估框架，发现MechLight方法表现最优但现有技术普遍存在长文本处理瓶颈


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法无法准确验证高亮解释(HEs)对上下文归因的有效性，导致用户无法判断模型依赖的是参数记忆还是实际上下文，也无法定位具体影响输出的上下文片段

Method: 通过构建包含已知真实上下文使用的控制测试案例，建立黄金标准HE评估框架。评估了包括改进的机械解释方法MechLight在内的4种HE方法，覆盖4种上下文场景、4个数据集和5种语言模型

Result: MechLight在所有上下文场景中表现最佳，但所有方法均存在长文本处理困难及位置偏差问题，揭示了解释准确性面临的根本性挑战

Conclusion: 需要开发新方法来解决现有解释技术的局限性，以实现大规模可靠的上下文利用解释

Abstract: Context utilisation, the ability of Language Models (LMs) to incorporate
relevant information from the provided context when generating responses,
remains largely opaque to users, who cannot determine whether models draw from
parametric memory or provided context, nor identify which specific context
pieces inform the response. Highlight explanations (HEs) offer a natural
solution as they can point the exact context pieces and tokens that influenced
model outputs. However, no existing work evaluates their effectiveness in
accurately explaining context utilisation. We address this gap by introducing
the first gold standard HE evaluation framework for context attribution, using
controlled test cases with known ground-truth context usage, which avoids the
limitations of existing indirect proxy evaluations. To demonstrate the
framework's broad applicability, we evaluate four HE methods -- three
established techniques and MechLight, a mechanistic interpretability approach
we adapt for this task -- across four context scenarios, four datasets, and
five LMs. Overall, we find that MechLight performs best across all context
scenarios. However, all methods struggle with longer contexts and exhibit
positional biases, pointing to fundamental challenges in explanation accuracy
that require new approaches to deliver reliable context utilisation
explanations at scale.

TL;DR: 研究发现用户与LLM聊天机器人交互时存在语法流畅性、礼貌程度和词汇多样性等沟通风格差异，数据增强策略显著提升模型适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对LLM部署后用户沟通风格转变的适应性问题，验证仅基于人类互动数据训练的模型存在不足，需探索增强策略。

Method: 采用数据增强（后训练阶段）和推理时用户消息重构两种策略进行对比实验。

Result: 风格多样化数据集训练的模型效果优于单一数据集，推理时重构策略效果有限。

Conclusion: 研究为优化LLM用户体验提供了数据增强方向，有助于模型更好适应实际部署中的沟通风格变化。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in customer-facing
applications, a critical yet underexplored question is how users communicate
differently with LLM chatbots compared to human agent. In this study, we
present empirical evidence that users adopt distinct communication styles when
users interact with chatbots versus human agents. Our analysis reveals
significant differences in grammatical fluency, politeness, and lexical
diversity in user language between the two settings. These findings suggest
that models trained exclusively on human-human interaction data may not
adequately accommodate the communication style shift that occurs once an LLM
chatbot is deployed. To enhance LLM robustness to post-launch communication
style changes, we experimented with two strategies: (1) data augmentation
during the post-training phase and (2) inference-time user message
reformulation. Our results indicate that models trained on stylistically
diverse datasets significantly outperform those trained exclusively on original
or stylistically uniform datasets, while inference-time reformulation proved
less effective. These insights help us to better adapt our models for improved
LLM-user interaction experiences.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在多语言推理任务中存在性能局限，主要由于非高资源语言的语义理解不足和表达差异导致的推理路径不一致

Method: 采用两阶段转换：1）语言思维转换将语义信息转化为结构化表示；2）结构化知识转换保持跨语言推理路径一致性

Result: 在多个多语言推理基准测试中超越基线模型，兼容不同大模型架构，并能与其他无训练策略结合实现进一步优化

Conclusion: SoT通过结构化表征有效提升多语言场景下的推理性能，为跨语言AI应用提供新思路

Abstract: Recent developments have enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to engage in
complex reasoning tasks through deep thinking. However, the capacity of
reasoning has not been successfully transferred to non-high-resource languages
due to resource constraints, which struggles with multilingual reasoning tasks.
To this end, we propose Structured-of-Thought (SoT), a training-free method
that improves the performance on multilingual reasoning through a multi-step
transformation: Language Thinking Transformation and Structured Knowledge
Transformation. The SoT method converts language-specific semantic information
into language-agnostic structured representations, enabling the models to
understand the query in different languages more sophisticated. Besides, SoT
effectively guides LLMs toward more concentrated reasoning to maintain
consistent underlying reasoning pathways when handling cross-lingual variations
in expression. Experimental results demonstrate that SoT outperforms several
strong baselines on multiple multilingual reasoning benchmarks when adapting to
various backbones of LLMs. It can also be integrated with other training-free
strategies for further improvements. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Cherry-qwq/SoT.

Abstract: Recent advancements in self-improvement for Large Language Models (LLMs) have
efficiently enhanced model capabilities without significantly increasing costs,
particularly in terms of human effort. While this area is still relatively
young, its extension to the multimodal domain holds immense potential for
leveraging diverse data sources and developing more general self-improving
models. This survey is the first to provide a comprehensive overview of
self-improvement in Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). We provide a structured overview
of the current literature and discuss methods from three perspectives: 1) data
collection, 2) data organization, and 3) model optimization, to facilitate the
further development of self-improvement in MLLMs. We also include commonly used
evaluations and downstream applications. Finally, we conclude by outlining open
challenges and future research directions.

Motivation: 现有不确定性量化研究集中于封闭式QA，但实际应用中更重要的上下文QA任务缺乏有效UQ方法

Method: 1. 定义标记级交叉熵不确定性度量 → 分解认知成分 → 引入理想模型近似真实分布 → 推导认知不确定性上界；2. 构建语义特征框架（上下文依赖/理解/诚实性）→ 小样本特征提取 → 集成不确定性评分

Conclusion: 理论推导与语义特征相结合的方法有效解决了上下文QA的不确定性量化难题，为实际应用提供高效解决方案

Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) research has primarily focused on closed-book
factual question answering (QA), while contextual QA remains unexplored,
despite its importance in real-world applications. In this work, we focus on UQ
for the contextual QA task and propose a theoretically grounded approach to
quantify epistemic uncertainty. We begin by introducing a task-agnostic,
token-level uncertainty measure defined as the cross-entropy between the
predictive distribution of the given model and the unknown true distribution.
By decomposing this measure, we isolate the epistemic component and approximate
the true distribution by a perfectly prompted, idealized model. We then derive
an upper bound for epistemic uncertainty and show that it can be interpreted as
semantic feature gaps in the given model's hidden representations relative to
the ideal model. We further apply this generic framework to the contextual QA
task and hypothesize that three features approximate this gap: context-reliance
(using the provided context rather than parametric knowledge), context
comprehension (extracting relevant information from context), and honesty
(avoiding intentional lies). Using a top-down interpretability approach, we
extract these features by using only a small number of labeled samples and
ensemble them to form a robust uncertainty score. Experiments on multiple QA
benchmarks in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings show that
our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised
(sampling-free and sampling-based) and supervised UQ methods, achieving up to a
13-point PRR improvement while incurring a negligible inference overhead.

Method: 使用Cox比例风险/加速失效时间/随机生存森林模型，分析9个SOTA LLM的36,951轮对话数据，建模对话失败时间过程。

Result: 提示间语义突变（P2P）使失败风险激增，渐进累积漂移反显保护作用；含交互项的AFT模型表现最优（C指数0.92）。

Conclusion: 生存分析为LLM评估提供新范式，挑战语义一致性必要假设，为构建稳健对话系统提供定量依据。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized conversational AI, yet their
robustness in extended multi-turn dialogues remains poorly understood. Existing
evaluation frameworks focus on static benchmarks and single-turn assessments,
failing to capture the temporal dynamics of conversational degradation that
characterize real-world interactions. In this work, we present the first
comprehensive survival analysis of conversational AI robustness, analyzing
36,951 conversation turns across 9 state-of-the-art LLMs to model failure as a
time-to-event process. Our survival modeling framework-employing Cox
proportional hazards, Accelerated Failure Time, and Random Survival Forest
approaches-reveals extraordinary temporal dynamics. We find that abrupt,
prompt-to-prompt(P2P) semantic drift is catastrophic, dramatically increasing
the hazard of conversational failure. In stark contrast, gradual, cumulative
drift is highly protective, vastly reducing the failure hazard and enabling
significantly longer dialogues. AFT models with interactions demonstrate
superior performance, achieving excellent discrimination and exceptional
calibration. These findings establish survival analysis as a powerful paradigm
for evaluating LLM robustness, offer concrete insights for designing resilient
conversational agents, and challenge prevailing assumptions about the necessity
of semantic consistency in conversational AI Systems.

Result: LLM在复杂领域场景中存在性能瓶颈，小规模模型通过推理增强可在特定任务中获得显著效果提升

Conclusion: 通用基准测试存在局限性，应重视领域特定场景的性能评估，同时小规模模型的推理优化可能带来更高成本效益

Abstract: Results on existing LLM benchmarks capture little information over the model
capabilities in low-resource tasks, making it difficult to develop effective
solutions in these domains. To address these challenges, we curated 14
travel-domain datasets spanning 7 common NLP tasks using anonymised data from
real-world scenarios, and analysed the performance across LLMs. We report on
the accuracy, scaling behaviour, and reasoning capabilities of LLMs in a
variety of tasks. Our results confirm that general benchmarking results are
insufficient for understanding model performance in low-resource tasks. Despite
the amount of training FLOPs, out-of-the-box LLMs hit performance bottlenecks
in complex, domain-specific scenarios. Furthermore, reasoning provides a more
significant boost for smaller LLMs by making the model a better judge on
certain tasks.

Result: 在Wiki-MEL等数据集上超越现有方法，验证了困难负样本对表示学习的有效性

Conclusion: 基于策略梯度的对抗生成框架能有效提升多模态实体链接性能，证实负样本选择的关键作用

Abstract: The task of entity linking, which involves associating mentions with their
respective entities in a knowledge graph, has received significant attention
due to its numerous potential applications. Recently, various multimodal entity
linking (MEL) techniques have been proposed, targeted to learn comprehensive
embeddings by leveraging both text and vision modalities. The selection of
high-quality negative samples can potentially play a crucial role in
metric/representation learning. However, to the best of our knowledge, this
possibility remains unexplored in existing literature within the framework of
MEL. To fill this gap, we address the multimodal entity linking problem in a
generative adversarial setting where the generator is responsible for
generating high-quality negative samples, and the discriminator is assigned the
responsibility for the metric learning tasks. Since the generator is involved
in generating samples, which is a discrete process, we optimize it using policy
gradient techniques and propose a policy gradient-based generative adversarial
network for multimodal entity linking (PGMEL). Experimental results based on
Wiki-MEL, Richpedia-MEL and WikiDiverse datasets demonstrate that PGMEL learns
meaningful representation by selecting challenging negative samples and
outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了当前LLMs在文化敏感场景中的局限性，强调开发更公平模型需结合本地化评估框架和文化特异性数据集。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant traction across critical
domains owing to their impressive contextual understanding and generative
capabilities. However, their increasing deployment in high stakes applications
necessitates rigorous evaluation of embedded biases, particularly in culturally
diverse contexts like India where existing embedding-based bias assessment
methods often fall short in capturing nuanced stereotypes. We propose an
evaluation framework based on a encoder trained using contrastive learning that
captures fine-grained bias through embedding similarity. We also introduce a
novel dataset - IndiCASA (IndiBias-based Contextually Aligned Stereotypes and
Anti-stereotypes) comprising 2,575 human-validated sentences spanning five
demographic axes: caste, gender, religion, disability, and socioeconomic
status. Our evaluation of multiple open-weight LLMs reveals that all models
exhibit some degree of stereotypical bias, with disability related biases being
notably persistent, and religion bias generally lower likely due to global
debiasing efforts demonstrating the need for fairer model development.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but such training
typically demands substantial efforts in creating and annotating data. In this
work, we explore improving LLMs through RL with minimal data. Our approach
alternates between the LLM proposing a task and then attempting to solve it. To
minimize data dependency, we introduce two novel mechanisms grounded in
self-awareness: (1) self-aware difficulty prediction, where the model learns to
assess task difficulty relative to its own abilities and prioritize challenging
yet solvable tasks, and (2) self-aware limit breaking, where the model
recognizes when a task is beyond its capability boundary and proactively
requests external data to break through that limit. Extensive experiments on
nine benchmarks showing a 53.8% relative improvement with less than 1.2% extra
data demonstrate the efficacy of self-aware RL and underscore the promise of
self-evolving agent training.

Abstract: Cross-lingual topic modeling aims to uncover shared semantic themes across
languages. Several methods have been proposed to address this problem,
leveraging both traditional and neural approaches. While previous methods have
achieved some improvements in topic diversity, they often struggle to ensure
high topic coherence and consistent alignment across languages. We propose XTRA
(Cross-Lingual Topic Modeling with Topic and Representation Alignments), a
novel framework that unifies Bag-of-Words modeling with multilingual
embeddings. XTRA introduces two core components: (1) representation alignment,
aligning document-topic distributions via contrastive learning in a shared
semantic space; and (2) topic alignment, projecting topic-word distributions
into the same space to enforce crosslingual consistency. This dual mechanism
enables XTRA to learn topics that are interpretable (coherent and diverse) and
well-aligned across languages. Experiments on multilingual corpora confirm that
XTRA significantly outperforms strong baselines in topic coherence, diversity,
and alignment quality. Code and reproducible scripts are available at https:

Conclusion: SIMPA的模块化设计可扩展至其他复杂标注任务，为心理学与NLP的跨学科研究提供新范式

Abstract: Personality refers to individual differences in behavior, thinking, and
feeling. With the growing availability of digital footprints, especially from
social media, automated methods for personality assessment have become
increasingly important. Natural language processing (NLP) enables the analysis
of unstructured text data to identify personality indicators. However, two main
challenges remain central to this thesis: the scarcity of large,
personality-labeled datasets and the disconnect between personality psychology
and NLP, which restricts model validity and interpretability. To address these
challenges, this thesis presents two datasets -- MBTI9k and PANDORA --
collected from Reddit, a platform known for user anonymity and diverse
discussions. The PANDORA dataset contains 17 million comments from over 10,000
users and integrates the MBTI and Big Five personality models with demographic
information, overcoming limitations in data size, quality, and label coverage.
Experiments on these datasets show that demographic variables influence model
validity. In response, the SIMPA (Statement-to-Item Matching Personality
Assessment) framework was developed - a computational framework for
interpretable personality assessment that matches user-generated statements
with validated questionnaire items. By using machine learning and semantic
similarity, SIMPA delivers personality assessments comparable to human
evaluations while maintaining high interpretability and efficiency. Although
focused on personality assessment, SIMPA's versatility extends beyond this
domain. Its model-agnostic design, layered cue detection, and scalability make
it suitable for various research and practical applications involving complex
label taxonomies and variable cue associations with target concepts.

Abstract: Recent progress in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has led to more
accurate and interpretable multi-hop question answering (QA). Yet, challenges
persist in integrating iterative reasoning steps with external knowledge
retrieval. To address this, we introduce StepChain GraphRAG, a framework that
unites question decomposition with a Breadth-First Search (BFS) Reasoning Flow
for enhanced multi-hop QA. Our approach first builds a global index over the
corpus; at inference time, only retrieved passages are parsed on-the-fly into a
knowledge graph, and the complex query is split into sub-questions. For each
sub-question, a BFS-based traversal dynamically expands along relevant edges,
assembling explicit evidence chains without overwhelming the language model
with superfluous context. Experiments on MuSiQue, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and HotpotQA
show that StepChain GraphRAG achieves state-of-the-art Exact Match and F1
scores. StepChain GraphRAG lifts average EM by 2.57% and F1 by 2.13% over the
SOTA method, achieving the largest gain on HotpotQA (+4.70% EM, +3.44% F1).
StepChain GraphRAG also fosters enhanced explainability by preserving the
chain-of-thought across intermediate retrieval steps. We conclude by discussing
how future work can mitigate the computational overhead and address potential
hallucinations from large language models to refine efficiency and reliability
in multi-hop QA.

Motivation: 验证大语言模型在生物多样性保护中的可靠性，解决模型应用边界问题

Method: 对5个主流模型进行21,955个物种的四维度评估（分类/保护状态/分布/威胁）

Result: 分类准确率94.9% vs 保护状态评估仅27.2%，存在系统性物种偏好偏差

Conclusion: LLMs应作为信息检索工具，物种风险评估需保持人类专家决策权

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted in conservation to
address the biodiversity crisis, yet their reliability for species evaluation
is uncertain. This study systematically validates five leading models on 21,955
species across four core IUCN Red List assessment components: taxonomy,
conservation status, distribution, and threats. A critical paradox was
revealed: models excelled at taxonomic classification (94.9%) but consistently
failed at conservation reasoning (27.2% for status assessment). This
knowledge-reasoning gap, evident across all models, suggests inherent
architectural constraints, not just data limitations. Furthermore, models
exhibited systematic biases favoring charismatic vertebrates, potentially
amplifying existing conservation inequities. These findings delineate clear
boundaries for responsible LLM deployment: they are powerful tools for
information retrieval but require human oversight for judgment-based decisions.
A hybrid approach is recommended, where LLMs augment expert capacity while
human experts retain sole authority over risk assessment and policy.

success rate, a statistically significant 1.7% improvement over Forward
Checking (t=-4.82, p<0.001, Cohen's d=0.07) with 46% faster runtime (12.9ms
versus 23.7ms per guess). Under 10% noise, CSP-aware approaches maintain 5.3
percentage point advantages (29.0% versus 23.7%, p=0.041), while Probabilistic
CSP achieves 100% success across all noise levels (0-20%) through constraint
recovery mechanisms. Cross-lexicon validation on 500 Spanish words demonstrates
88% success with zero language-specific tuning, validating that core CSP
principles transfer across languages despite an 11.2 percentage point gap from
linguistic differences (p<0.001, Fisher's exact test). Our open-source
implementation with 34 unit tests achieving 91% code coverage provides
reproducible infrastructure for CSP research. The combination of formal CSP
treatment, constraint-aware heuristics, probabilistic-logical integration,
robustness analysis, and cross-lexicon validation establishes new performance
benchmarks demonstrating that principled constraint satisfaction techniques
outperform classical information-theoretic and learning-based approaches for
structured puzzle-solving domains.

Abstract: The diffusion model is a state-of-the-art generative model that generates an
image by applying a neural network iteratively. Moreover, this generation
process is regarded as an algorithm solving an ordinary differential equation
or a stochastic differential equation. Based on the analysis of the truncation
error of the diffusion ODE and SDE, our study proposes a training-free
algorithm that generates high-quality 512 x 512 and 1024 x 1024 images in eight
steps, with flexible guidance scales. To the best of my knowledge, our
algorithm is the first one that samples a 1024 x 1024 resolution image in 8
steps with an FID performance comparable to that of the latest distillation
model, but without additional training. Meanwhile, our algorithm can also
generate a 512 x 512 image in 8 steps, and its FID performance is better than
the inference result using state-of-the-art ODE solver DPM++ 2m in 20 steps. We
validate our eight-step image generation algorithm using the COCO 2014, COCO
2017, and LAION datasets. And our best FID performance is 15.7, 22.35, and
17.52. While the FID performance of DPM++2m is 17.3, 23.75, and 17.33. Further,
it also outperforms the state-of-the-art AMED-plugin solver, whose FID
performance is 19.07, 25.50, and 18.06. We also apply the algorithm in
five-step inference without additional training, for which the best FID
performance in the datasets mentioned above is 19.18, 23.24, and 19.61,
respectively, and is comparable to the performance of the state-of-the-art AMED
Pulgin solver in eight steps, SDXL-turbo in four steps, and the
state-of-the-art diffusion distillation model Flash Diffusion in five steps. We
also validate our algorithm in synthesizing 1024 * 1024 images within 6 steps,
whose FID performance only has a limited distance to the latest distillation
algorithm. The code is in repo:

Abstract: The visualization of 3D point cloud data is essential in fields such as
autonomous navigation, environmental monitoring, and disaster response, where
tasks like object recognition, structural analysis, and spatiotemporal
exploration rely on clear and effective visual representation. Despite
advancements in AI-driven processing, visualization remains a critical tool for
interpreting complex spatial datasets. However, designing effective point cloud
visualizations presents significant challenges due to the sparsity, density
variations, and scale of the data. In this work, we analyze the design space of
spatial point cloud visualization, highlighting a gap in systematically mapping
visualization techniques to analytical objectives. We introduce a taxonomy that
categorizes four decades of visualization design choices, linking them to
fundamental challenges in modern applications. By structuring visualization
strategies based on data types, user objectives, and visualization techniques,
our framework provides a foundation for advancing more effective,
interpretable, and user-centered visualization techniques.

Abstract: Constructing and sharing 3D maps is essential for many applications,
including autonomous driving and augmented reality. Recently, 3D Gaussian
splatting has emerged as a promising approach for accurate 3D reconstruction.

We evaluate GS-Share against state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating that our

improvements of 11%, 22%, and 74% in PSNR, LPIPS, and Depth L1, respectively.
Furthermore, GS-Share is significantly more compact, reducing map transmission

TL;DR: 提出FSFSplatter方法，通过端到端密集高斯初始化和几何增强优化，解决稀疏图像场景重建的表面质量难题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高斯泼溅技术依赖密集校准视图，稀疏图像重建存在表面质量差、过拟合和几何不一致问题

Method: 使用大型Transformer编码多视图→自分割高斯头生成初始场景→贡献度剪枝消除浮点→深度/多视图特征监督优化

Result: 在DTU和Replica数据集上超越当前SOTA方法

Conclusion: 首次实现自由稀疏图像的高效高质量表面重建，突破传统方法对密集视图的依赖

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has become a leading reconstruction technique, known for
its high-quality novel view synthesis and detailed reconstruction. However,
most existing methods require dense, calibrated views. Reconstructing from free
sparse images often leads to poor surface due to limited overlap and
overfitting. We introduce FSFSplatter, a new approach for fast surface
reconstruction from free sparse images. Our method integrates end-to-end dense
Gaussian initialization, camera parameter estimation, and geometry-enhanced
scene optimization. Specifically, FSFSplatter employs a large Transformer to
encode multi-view images and generates a dense and geometrically consistent
Gaussian scene initialization via a self-splitting Gaussian head. It eliminates
local floaters through contribution-based pruning and mitigates overfitting to
limited views by leveraging depth and multi-view feature supervision with
differentiable camera parameters during rapid optimization. FSFSplatter
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on widely used DTU and Replica.

Conclusion: ROGR通过光照条件NeRF的创新架构，实现了高效且高质量的物体重光照，推动了三维重建与渲染技术的发展

Abstract: We introduce ROGR, a novel approach that reconstructs a relightable 3D model
of an object captured from multiple views, driven by a generative relighting
model that simulates the effects of placing the object under novel environment
illuminations. Our method samples the appearance of the object under multiple
lighting environments, creating a dataset that is used to train a
lighting-conditioned Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) that outputs the object's
appearance under any input environmental lighting. The lighting-conditioned
NeRF uses a novel dual-branch architecture to encode the general lighting
effects and specularities separately. The optimized lighting-conditioned NeRF
enables efficient feed-forward relighting under arbitrary environment maps
without requiring per-illumination optimization or light transport simulation.
We evaluate our approach on the established TensoIR and Stanford-ORB datasets,
where it improves upon the state-of-the-art on most metrics, and showcase our
approach on real-world object captures.

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: 提出CGINS神经网络框架，结合预处理共轭梯度求解器，实现高分辨率均质化问题的高效精确求解（相对误差<1%，速度提升2-10倍）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值求解器计算成本高，现有学习方法在复杂拓扑和高分辨率场景下存在精度与泛化性不足的问题。

Method: 采用稀疏周期3D卷积保持结构周期性，多级网络架构实现跨尺度学习，集成PCG迭代提供快速收敛初值，并利用最小势能作为无监督损失函数。

Conclusion: CGINS突破了学习方法的精度瓶颈，首次在保持物理一致性的前提下实现高分辨率均质化问题的高效求解，为工程应用提供新范式。

Abstract: The mechanical properties of periodic microstructures are pivotal in various
engineering applications. Homogenization theory is a powerful tool for
predicting these properties by averaging the behavior of complex
microstructures over a representative volume element. However, traditional
numerical solvers for homogenization problems can be computationally expensive,
especially for high-resolution and complicated topology and geometry. Existing
learning-based methods, while promising, often struggle with accuracy and
generalization in such scenarios. To address these challenges, we present
CGINS, a preconditioned-conjugate-gradient-solver-informed neural network for
solving homogenization problems. CGINS leverages sparse and periodic 3D
convolution to enable high-resolution learning while ensuring structural
periodicity. It features a multi-level network architecture that facilitates
effective learning across different scales and employs minimum potential energy
as label-free loss functions for self-supervised learning. The integrated
preconditioned conjugate gradient iterations ensure that the network provides
PCG-friendly initial solutions for fast convergence and high accuracy.
Additionally, CGINS imposes a global displacement constraint to ensure physical
consistency, addressing a key limitation in prior methods that rely on
Dirichlet anchors. Evaluated on large-scale datasets with diverse topologies
and material configurations, CGINS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (relative
error below 1%) and outperforms both learning-based baselines and
GPU-accelerated numerical solvers. Notably, it delivers 2 times to 10 times
speedups over traditional methods while maintaining physically reliable
predictions at resolutions up to $512^3$.
