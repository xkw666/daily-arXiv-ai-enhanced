Unlike traditional images\nor videos, 3D point clouds present unique challenges for copyright enforcement,\nas they are especially vulnerable to a range of geometric and non-geometric\nattacks that can easily degrade or remove conventional watermark signals. In\nthis paper, we address these challenges by proposing a robust deep neural\nwatermarking framework for 3D point cloud copyright protection and ownership\nverification. Our approach embeds binary watermarks into the singular values of\n3D point cloud blocks using spectral decomposition, i.e. Singular Value\nDecomposition (SVD), and leverages the extraction capabilities of Deep Learning\nusing PointNet++ neural network architecture. The network is trained to\nreliably extract watermarks even after the data undergoes various attacks such\nas rotation, scaling, noise, cropping and signal distortions. We validated our\nmethod using the publicly available ModelNet40 dataset, demonstrating that deep\nlearning-based extraction significantly outperforms traditional SVD-based\ntechniques under challenging conditions. Our experimental evaluation\ndemonstrates that the deep learning-based extraction approach significantly\noutperforms existing SVD-based methods with deep learning achieving bitwise\naccuracy up to 0.83 and Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.80, compared to SVD\nachieving a bitwise accuracy of 0.58 and IoU of 0.26 for the Crop (70%) attack,\nwhich is the most severe geometric distortion in our experiment.

Second, the vector is expanded into K soft\nslots and trained with minimal adapters so the frozen decoder consumes the\nsignal. LLINK substantially improves bilingual retrieval and achieves 81.3%\npreference over the base model and 63.6% over direct fine-tuning in LLM-judged\nQ&A evaluations. We further find that improvements can be attributed to reduced\ntokenization inflation and a stronger cross lingual alignment, despite the\nmodel having residual weaknesses in numeric fidelity. Treating low resource\nlanguages as a modality offers a practical path to stronger cross-lingual\nalignment in lightweight LLMs."}

In this paper, we address this by showing that the multilingual\nreasoning gap largely stems from failures in language understanding-the model's\ninability to represent the multilingual input meaning into the dominant\nlanguage (i.e., English) within its reasoning trace.

While the discovery of decodable neural\nrepresentations for distinct concepts in Large Language Models (LLMs) has\nsuggested a modular architecture, whether these representations are truly\nindependent systems remains an open question. Here we provide evidence for a\nconvergent architecture. Across a range of LLMs, we find that diverse\nevaluative judgments are computed along a dominant dimension, which we term the\nValence-Assent Axis (VAA). This axis jointly encodes subjective valence (\"what\nis good\") and the model's assent to factual claims (\"what is true\"). Through\ndirect interventions, we show this unified representation creates a critical\ndependency: the VAA functions as a control signal that steers the generative\nprocess to construct a rationale consistent with its evaluative state, even at\nthe cost of factual accuracy.

This method provides direct feedback on the model's\ncurrent knowledge, guiding it to align with domain-specific standards.\nExperiments in English-Brazilian Portuguese and English-Korean show that, by\nusing just 14.7k preference pairs, the model achieves performance close to that\nof a model trained on 160k+ samples with SFT, demonstrating significant data\nefficiency.

We evaluate instruction-tuned and reasoning\nmodels on BBH, GPQA, and MMLU. Our results show that models can appear faithful\nyet remain hard to monitor when they leave out key factors, and that\nmonitorability differs sharply across model families. We release our evaluation\ncode using the Inspect library to support reproducible future work."}

Interpreting a new model typically requires costly training\nof model-specific sparse autoencoders, manual or semi-automated labeling of SAE\ncomponents, and their subsequent validation. We introduce Atlas-Alignment, a\nframework for transferring interpretability across language models by aligning\nunknown latent spaces to a Concept Atlas - a labeled, human-interpretable\nlatent space - using only shared inputs and lightweight representational\nalignment techniques. Once aligned, this enables two key capabilities in\npreviously opaque models: (1) semantic feature search and retrieval, and (2)\nsteering generation along human-interpretable atlas concepts. Through\nquantitative and qualitative evaluations, we show that simple representational\nalignment methods enable robust semantic retrieval and steerable generation\nwithout the need for labeled concept data. Atlas-Alignment thus amortizes the\ncost of explainable AI and mechanistic interpretability: by investing in one\nhigh-quality Concept Atlas, we can make many new models transparent and\ncontrollable at minimal marginal cost."}

While existing methods that use supervised\nfine-tuning~(SFT) or reinforcement learning~(RL) with token-length rewards can\nimprove efficiency, they often do so at the cost of accuracy. This paper\nintroduces \\textbf{DeepCompress}, a novel framework that simultaneously\nenhances both the accuracy and efficiency of LRMs. We challenge the prevailing\napproach of consistently favoring shorter reasoning paths, showing that longer\nresponses can contain a broader range of correct solutions for difficult\nproblems. DeepCompress employs an adaptive length reward mechanism that\ndynamically classifies problems as ``Simple'' or ``Hard'' in real-time based on\nthe model's evolving capability. It encourages shorter, more efficient\nreasoning for ``Simple'' problems while promoting longer, more exploratory\nthought chains for ``Hard'' problems. This dual-reward strategy enables the\nmodel to autonomously adjust its Chain-of-Thought (CoT) length, compressing\nreasoning for well-mastered problems and extending it for those it finds\nchallenging. Experimental results on challenging mathematical benchmarks show\nthat DeepCompress consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving superior\naccuracy while significantly improving token efficiency."}

Bogdan contributed equally to this work, and\n  their listed order was determined by coinflip", "summary": "Most work interpreting reasoning models studies only a single\nchain-of-thought (CoT), yet these models define distributions over many\npossible CoTs. We argue that studying a single sample is inadequate for\nunderstanding causal influence and the underlying computation. Though fully\nspecifying this distribution is intractable, it can be understood by sampling.\nWe present case studies using resampling to investigate model decisions. First,\nwhen a model states a reason for its action, does that reason actually cause\nthe action? In \"agentic misalignment\" scenarios, we resample specific sentences\nto measure their downstream effects. Self-preservation sentences have small\ncausal impact, suggesting they do not meaningfully drive blackmail. Second, are\nartificial edits to CoT sufficient for steering reasoning? These are common in\nliterature, yet take the model off-policy. Resampling and selecting a\ncompletion with the desired property is a principled on-policy alternative. We\nfind off-policy interventions yield small and unstable effects compared to\nresampling in decision-making tasks. Third, how do we understand the effect of\nremoving a reasoning step when the model may repeat it post-edit? We introduce\na resilience metric that repeatedly resamples to prevent similar content from\nreappearing downstream. Critical planning statements resist removal but have\nlarge effects when eliminated. Fourth, since CoT is sometimes \"unfaithful\", can\nour methods teach us anything in these settings? Adapting causal mediation\nanalysis, we find that hints that have a causal effect on the output without\nbeing explicitly mentioned exert a subtle and cumulative influence on the CoT\nthat persists even if the hint is removed. Overall, studying distributions via\nresampling enables reliable causal analysis, clearer narratives of model\nreasoning, and principled CoT interventions."}

We introduce SIGMA (Search-Augmented On-Demand Knowledge\nIntegration for AGentic Mathematical reAsoning), a unified framework that\norchestrates specialized agents to independently reason, perform targeted\nsearches, and synthesize findings through a moderator mechanism. Each agent\ngenerates hypothetical passages to optimize retrieval for its analytic\nperspective, ensuring knowledge integration is both context-sensitive and\ncomputation-efficient.

To break this cycle, we introduce a framework built on the\nco-design of evaluation, data, and modeling. First, we establish the Universal\nVideo Retrieval Benchmark (UVRB), a suite of 16 datasets designed not only to\nmeasure performance but also to diagnose critical capability gaps across tasks\nand domains. Second, guided by UVRB's diagnostics, we introduce a scalable\nsynthesis workflow that generates 1.55 million high-quality pairs to populate\nthe semantic space required for universality. Finally, we devise the Modality\nPyramid, a curriculum that trains our General Video Embedder (GVE) by\nexplicitly leveraging the latent interconnections within our diverse data.\nExtensive experiments show GVE achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot\ngeneralization on UVRB. In particular, our analysis reveals that popular\nbenchmarks are poor predictors of general ability and that partially relevant\nretrieval is a dominant but overlooked scenario.

However, such vision driven embodied agents open a new attack\nsurface: visual backdoor attacks, where the agent behaves normally until a\nvisual trigger appears in the scene, then persistently executes an\nattacker-specified multi-step policy. We introduce BEAT, the first framework to\ninject such visual backdoors into MLLM-based embodied agents using objects in\nthe environments as triggers. Unlike textual triggers, object triggers exhibit\nwide variation across viewpoints and lighting, making them difficult to implant\nreliably. BEAT addresses this challenge by (1) constructing a training set that\nspans diverse scenes, tasks, and trigger placements to expose agents to trigger\nvariability, and (2) introducing a two-stage training scheme that first applies\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) and then our novel Contrastive Trigger Learning\n(CTL). CTL formulates trigger discrimination as preference learning between\ntrigger-present and trigger-free inputs, explicitly sharpening the decision\nboundaries to ensure precise backdoor activation. Across various embodied agent\nbenchmarks and MLLMs, BEAT achieves attack success rates up to 80%, while\nmaintaining strong benign task performance, and generalizes reliably to\nout-of-distribution trigger placements. Notably, compared to naive SFT, CTL\nboosts backdoor activation accuracy up to 39% under limited backdoor data.\nThese findings expose a critical yet unexplored security risk in MLLM-based\nembodied agents, underscoring the need for robust defenses before real-world\ndeployment."}
