In this challenging setting, traditional\nimage stitching pipelines fail, producing outputs with ghosting and other\nartifacts. While recent generative models are capable of outpainting content\nconsistent with multiple reference images, they fail when tasked with\nsynthesizing large, coherent regions of a panorama. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a method that fine-tunes a diffusion-based inpainting\nmodel to preserve a scene's content and layout based on multiple reference\nimages. Once fine-tuned, the model outpaints a full panorama from a single\nreference image, producing a seamless and visually coherent result that\nfaithfully integrates content from all reference images. Our approach\nsignificantly outperforms baselines for this task in terms of image quality and\nthe consistency of image structure and scene layout when evaluated on captured\ndatasets."}

Such advancements in 3D language fields are crucial for\napplications that require language interaction within complex scenes. However,\nLangSplat does not yet achieve real-time inference performance (8.2 FPS), even\nwith advanced A100 GPUs, severely limiting its broader application. In this\npaper, we first conduct a detailed time analysis of LangSplat, identifying the\nheavyweight decoder as the primary speed bottleneck. Our solution, LangSplatV2\nassumes that each Gaussian acts as a sparse code within a global dictionary,\nleading to the learning of a 3D sparse coefficient field that entirely\neliminates the need for a heavyweight decoder. By leveraging this sparsity, we\nfurther propose an efficient sparse coefficient splatting method with CUDA\noptimization, rendering high-dimensional feature maps at high quality while\nincurring only the time cost of splatting an ultra-low-dimensional feature.

However, it remains unclear if these differences in\nbiases stem from pretraining, finetuning, or even random noise due to training\nstochasticity. We propose a two-step causal experimental approach to\ndisentangle these factors. First, we finetune models multiple times using\ndifferent random seeds to study how training randomness affects over $30$\ncognitive biases. Second, we introduce \\emph{cross-tuning} -- swapping\ninstruction datasets between models to isolate bias sources. This swap uses\ndatasets that led to different bias patterns, directly testing whether biases\nare dataset-dependent. Our findings reveal that while training randomness\nintroduces some variability, biases are mainly shaped by pretraining: models\nwith the same pretrained backbone exhibit more similar bias patterns than those\nsharing only finetuning data. These insights suggest that understanding biases\nin finetuned models requires considering their pretraining origins beyond\nfinetuning effects.

In this work, we\nreproduce the Vec2Text framework and evaluate it from two perspectives: (1)\nvalidating the original claims, and (2) extending the study through targeted\nexperiments. First, we successfully replicate the original key results in both\nin-domain and out-of-domain settings, with only minor discrepancies arising due\nto missing artifacts, such as model checkpoints and dataset splits.\nFurthermore, we extend the study by conducting a parameter sensitivity\nanalysis, evaluating the feasibility of reconstructing sensitive inputs (e.g.,\npasswords), and exploring embedding quantization as a lightweight privacy\ndefense. Our results show that Vec2Text is effective under ideal conditions,\ncapable of reconstructing even password-like sequences that lack clear\nsemantics. However, we identify key limitations, including its sensitivity to\ninput sequence length. We also find that Gaussian noise and quantization\ntechniques can mitigate the privacy risks posed by Vec2Text, with quantization\noffering a simpler and more widely applicable solution. Our findings emphasize\nthe need for caution in using text embeddings and highlight the importance of\nfurther research into robust defense mechanisms for NLP systems."}

In this report, we present PyVision, an interactive,\nmulti-turn framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and\nrefine Python-based tools tailored to the task at hand, unlocking flexible and\ninterpretable problem-solving. We develop a taxonomy of the tools created by\nPyVision and analyze their usage across a diverse set of benchmarks.\nQuantitatively, PyVision achieves consistent performance gains, boosting\nGPT-4.1 by +7.8% on V* and Claude-4.0-Sonnet by +31.1% on VLMsAreBlind-mini.\nThese results point to a broader shift: dynamic tooling allows models not just\nto use tools, but to invent them, advancing toward more agentic visual\nreasoning."}

This paper explores an alternative, constructive approach to model\ndevelopment, built upon the foundation of non-trainable, deterministic input\nembeddings. In prior [1], we established that high-level semantic reasoning can\nemerge in Transformers using frozen embeddings derived from the visual\nstructure of Unicode glyphs. Here, we demonstrate that this fixed\nrepresentational substrate acts as a universal \"docking port,\" enabling two\npowerful and efficient scaling paradigms: seamless modular composition and\nprogressive layer-wise growth.\n  First, we show that specialist models trained on disparate datasets (e.g.,\nRussian and Chinese text) can be merged into a single, more capable\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) model, post-training, with zero architectural\nmodification. This is achieved by simply averaging their output logits. The\nresulting MoE model exhibits immediate performance improvements on reasoning\nbenchmarks like MMLU, surpassing its constituent experts without catastrophic\nforgetting. Second, we introduce a layer-wise constructive training\nmethodology, where a deep Transformer is \"grown\" by progressively stacking and\ntraining one layer at a time. This method demonstrates stable convergence and a\nclear correlation between model depth and the emergence of complex reasoning\nabilities, such as those required for SQuAD.\n  Our findings suggest a paradigm shift from monolithic optimization towards a\nmore biological or constructive model of AI development, where complexity is\nbuilt incrementally and modules can be composed freely. This opens new avenues\nfor resource-efficient scaling, continual learning, and a more democratized\necosystem for building powerful AI systems.
