Through experiments on\nvarious tokenization methods like MeshXL, MeshAnything V2, and Edgerunner, we\nfurther validate the performance of our method.

Multi-character interactions involve not\nonly natural interactive motions but also characters coordinated with each\nother for transition. For example, a dance scenario involves characters dancing\nwith partners and also characters coordinated to new partners based on spatial\nand temporal observations. We term such transitions as coordinated interactions\nand decompose them into interaction synthesis and transition planning. Previous\nmethods of single-character animation do not consider interactions that are\ncritical for multiple characters. Deep-learning-based interaction synthesis\nusually focuses on two characters and does not consider transition planning.\nOptimization-based interaction synthesis relies on manually designing objective\nfunctions that may not generalize well. While crowd simulation involves more\ncharacters, their interactions are sparse and passive. We identify two\nchallenges to multi-character interaction synthesis, including the lack of data\nand the planning of transitions among close and dense interactions. Existing\ndatasets either do not have multiple characters or do not have close and dense\ninteractions. The planning of transitions for multi-character close and dense\ninteractions needs both spatial and temporal considerations. We propose a\nconditional generative pipeline comprising a coordinatable multi-character\ninteraction space for interaction synthesis and a transition planning network\nfor coordinations. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nproposed pipeline for multicharacter interaction synthesis and the applications\nfacilitated by our method show the scalability and transferability."}

This work then presents the first\nunified framework for analyzing the dynamic relationships among LLM enabled AO,\nAM, and AV in the context of authorship privacy. We quantify how they interact\nwith each other to transform human authored text, examining effects at a single\npoint in time and iteratively over time.

Within\nthis process, document reranking plays a critical role by refining first-stage\nretrieval results. However, large language model (LLM) listwise reranking faces\nunique challenges in the scientific domain. First-stage retrieval is often\nsuboptimal in the scientific domain, so relevant documents are ranked lower.\nMoreover, conventional listwise reranking uses the full text of candidate\ndocuments in the context window, limiting the number of candidates that can be\nconsidered. As a result, many relevant documents are excluded before reranking,\nwhich constrains overall retrieval performance. To address these challenges, we\nexplore compact document representations based on semantic features such as\ncategories, sections, and keywords, and propose a training-free, model-agnostic\nreranking framework for scientific retrieval called CoRank. The framework\ninvolves three stages: (i) offline extraction of document-level features, (ii)\ncoarse reranking using these compact representations, and (iii) fine-grained\nreranking on full texts of the top candidates from stage (ii). This hybrid\ndesign provides a high-level abstraction of document semantics, expands\ncandidate coverage, and retains critical details required for precise ranking.\nExperiments on LitSearch and CSFCube show that CoRank significantly improves\nreranking performance across different LLM backbones, increasing nDCG@10 from\n32.0 to 39.7.

Our study\nfocuses specifically on backdoor-triggered responses -- where specific input\nphrases activate hidden vulnerabilities causing the model to generate unsafe\ncontent like violence, pornography, or hate speech. We address two key\nchallenges: (1) identifying true causal indicators rather than surface\ncorrelations, and (2) preventing advanced models from deception -- deliberately\nevading monitoring systems. Hence, we approach this problem from an\nunsupervised lens by drawing parallels to human deception: just as humans\nexhibit physical indicators while lying, we investigate whether LLMs display\ndistinct internal behavioral signatures when generating harmful content. Our\nstudy addresses two critical challenges: 1) designing monitoring systems that\ncapture true causal indicators rather than superficial correlations; and\n2)preventing intentional evasion by increasingly capable \"Future models''. Our\nfindings show that models can produce harmful content through causal mechanisms\nand can become deceptive by: (a) alternating between linear and non-linear\nrepresentations, and (b) modifying feature relationships. To counter this, we\ndeveloped Safety-Net -- a multi-detector framework that monitors different\nrepresentation dimensions, successfully detecting harmful behavior even when\ninformation is shifted across representational spaces to evade individual\nmonitors. Our evaluation shows 96% accuracy in detecting harmful cases using\nour unsupervised ensemble approach."}

Quantization-aware training (QAT)\naddresses these challenges by reducing model precision while maintaining\nperformance. However, the scaling behavior of QAT, especially at 4-bit\nprecision (W4A4), is not well understood. Existing QAT scaling laws often\nignore key factors such as the number of training tokens and quantization\ngranularity, which limits their applicability. This paper proposes a unified\nscaling law for QAT that models quantization error as a function of model size,\ntraining data volume, and quantization group size. Through 268 QAT experiments,\nwe show that quantization error decreases as model size increases, but rises\nwith more training tokens and coarser quantization granularity. To identify the\nsources of W4A4 quantization error, we decompose it into weight and activation\ncomponents. Both components follow the overall trend of W4A4 quantization\nerror, but with different sensitivities. Specifically, weight quantization\nerror increases more rapidly with more training tokens. Further analysis shows\nthat the activation quantization error in the FC2 layer, caused by outliers, is\nthe primary bottleneck of W4A4 QAT quantization error. By applying\nmixed-precision quantization to address this bottleneck, we demonstrate that\nweight and activation quantization errors can converge to similar levels.\nAdditionally, with more training data, weight quantization error eventually\nexceeds activation quantization error, suggesting that reducing weight\nquantization error is also important in such scenarios. These findings offer\nkey insights for improving QAT research and development."}

However, tasks that require complex reasoning or\ndeep contextual understanding are often hindered by biases or interference from\nthe base model when using typical decoding methods like greedy or beam search.\nThese biases can lead to generic or task-agnostic responses from the base model\ninstead of leveraging the LoRA-specific adaptations. In this paper, we\nintroduce Contrastive LoRA Decoding (CoLD), a novel decoding framework designed\nto maximize the use of task-specific knowledge in LoRA-adapted models,\nresulting in better downstream performance. CoLD uses contrastive decoding by\nscoring candidate tokens based on the divergence between the probability\ndistributions of a LoRA-adapted expert model and the corresponding base model.\nThis approach prioritizes tokens that better align with the LoRA's learned\nrepresentations, enhancing performance for specialized tasks. While effective,\na naive implementation of CoLD is computationally expensive because each\ndecoding step requires evaluating multiple token candidates across both models.\nTo address this, we developed an optimized kernel for Huawei's Ascend NPU. CoLD\nachieves up to a 5.54% increase in task accuracy while reducing end-to-end\nlatency by 28% compared to greedy decoding. This work provides practical and\nefficient decoding strategies for fine-tuned LLMs in resource-constrained\nenvironments and has broad implications for applied data science in both cloud\nand on-premises settings."}

Our in-depth study of the Big-Math-RL-Verified dataset reveals\nthat over 38% of model-generated responses suffer from false negatives, where\nthe verifier fails to recognize correct answers. We show, both empirically and\ntheoretically, that these false negatives severely impair RL training by\ndepriving the model of informative gradient signals and slowing convergence. To\nmitigate this, we propose tinyV, a lightweight LLM-based verifier that augments\nexisting rule-based methods, which dynamically identifies potential false\nnegatives and recovers valid responses to produce more accurate reward\nestimates. Across multiple math-reasoning benchmarks, integrating TinyV boosts\npass rates by up to 10% and accelerates convergence relative to the baseline.\nOur findings highlight the critical importance of addressing verifier false\nnegatives and offer a practical approach to improve RL-based fine-tuning of\nLLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/uw-nsl/TinyV."}

However, while this paradigm\nenhances convenience, it disrupts the feedback-driven improvement loop that has\nhistorically powered the evolution of traditional Web search. Web search can\ncontinuously improve their ranking models by collecting large-scale,\nfine-grained user feedback (e.g., clicks, dwell time) at the document level. In\ncontrast, generative AI search operates through a much longer search pipeline,\nspanning query decomposition, document retrieval, and answer generation, yet\ntypically receives only coarse-grained feedback on the final answer. This\nintroduces a feedback loop disconnect, where user feedback for the final output\ncannot be effectively mapped back to specific system components, making it\ndifficult to improve each intermediate stage and sustain the feedback loop. In\nthis paper, we envision NExT-Search, a next-generation paradigm designed to\nreintroduce fine-grained, process-level feedback into generative AI search.\nNExT-Search integrates two complementary modes: User Debug Mode, which allows\nengaged users to intervene at key stages; and Shadow User Mode, where a\npersonalized user agent simulates user preferences and provides AI-assisted\nfeedback for less interactive users. Furthermore, we envision how these\nfeedback signals can be leveraged through online adaptation, which refines\ncurrent search outputs in real-time, and offline update, which aggregates\ninteraction logs to periodically fine-tune query decomposition, retrieval, and\ngeneration models.
