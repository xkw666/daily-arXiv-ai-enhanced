Previous work adopts\nthe split conformal prediction (SCP) framework to ensure desired coverage of\nadmissible answers by constructing prediction sets, but these sets often\ncontain incorrect candidates, limiting their practical utility. To address\nthis, we propose COIN, an uncertainty-guarding selection framework that\ncalibrates statistically valid thresholds to filter a single generated answer\nper question under user-specified FDR constraints. COIN estimates the empirical\nerror rate on a calibration set and applies confidence interval methods such as\nClopper-Pearson to establish a high-probability upper bound on the true error\nrate (i.e., FDR). This enables the selection of the largest uncertainty\nthreshold that ensures FDR control on test data while significantly increasing\nsample retention. We demonstrate COIN's robustness in risk control, strong\ntest-time power in retaining admissible answers, and predictive efficiency\nunder limited calibration data across both general and multimodal text\ngeneration tasks. Furthermore, we show that employing alternative upper bound\nconstructions and UQ strategies can further boost COIN's power performance,\nwhich underscores its extensibility and adaptability to diverse application\nscenarios."}

We train a 7B dLLM, \\textbf{DiffuCoder}, on 130B tokens of code.\nUsing this model as a testbed, we analyze its decoding behavior, revealing how\nit differs from that of AR models: (1) dLLMs can decide how causal their\ngeneration should be without relying on semi-AR decoding, and (2) increasing\nthe sampling temperature diversifies not only token choices but also their\ngeneration order. This diversity creates a rich search space for RL rollouts.\nFor RL training, to reduce the variance of token log-likelihood estimates and\nmaintain training efficiency, we propose \\textbf{coupled-GRPO}, a novel\nsampling scheme that constructs complementary mask noise for completions used\nin training. In our experiments, coupled-GRPO significantly improves\nDiffuCoder's performance on code generation benchmarks (+4.4\\% on EvalPlus) and\nreduces reliance on AR causal during decoding. Our work provides deeper insight\ninto the machinery of dLLM generation and offers an effective, diffusion-native\nRL training framework. https://github.com/apple/ml-diffucoder."}

Commercial Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and\nDeepSeek, require substantial resources, while the utilization of these systems\nfor medical purposes raises critical issues regarding patient privacy and\nsafety. Methods We developed a customizable Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG) framework for medical tasks, which monitors its energy usage and CO2\nemissions. This system was then used to create RAGs based on various\nopen-source LLMs. The tested models included both general purpose models like\nllama3.1:8b and medgemma-4b-it, which is medical-domain specific. The best RAGs\nperformance and energy consumption was compared to DeepSeekV3-R1 and OpenAIs\no4-mini model.

The RAG model built on llama3.1:8B achieved the highest accuracy\n(58.5%) and was significantly better than other models, including o4-mini and\nDeepSeekV3-R1. The llama3.1-RAG also exhibited the lowest energy consumption\nand CO2 footprint among all models, with a Performance per kWh of 0.52 and a\ntotal CO2 emission of 473g.
