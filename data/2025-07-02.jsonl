While recent prompting-based methods using Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) have shown promise in ISA, they often rely on majority\nvoting over chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning paths without evaluating their\ncausal validity, making them susceptible to internal biases and spurious\ncorrelations. To address this challenge, we propose CAPITAL, a causal prompting\nframework that incorporates front-door adjustment into CoT reasoning. CAPITAL\ndecomposes the overall causal effect into two components: the influence of the\ninput prompt on the reasoning chains, and the impact of those chains on the\nfinal output. These components are estimated using encoder-based clustering and\nthe NWGM approximation, with a contrastive learning objective used to better\nalign the encoder's representation with the LLM's reasoning space. Experiments\non benchmark ISA datasets with three LLMs demonstrate that CAPITAL consistently\noutperforms strong prompting baselines in both accuracy and robustness,\nparticularly under adversarial conditions.

The method represents semantic\nfeatures in input text through a vectorized capsule structure. It uses a\ndynamic routing mechanism to transfer information across multiple capsule\nlayers. This helps capture hierarchical relationships and part-whole structures\nbetween semantic entities more effectively. The model uses a convolutional\nfeature extraction module as the low-level encoder. After generating initial\nsemantic capsules, it forms high-level abstract intent representations through\nan iterative routing process. To further enhance performance, a margin-based\nmechanism is introduced into the loss function. This improves the model's\nability to distinguish between intent classes.

We study whether a similar\ndynamic emerges in multi-agent LLM systems. We tested six models on\nwell-established sets of moral dilemmas across two conditions: (1) Solo, where\nmodels reasoned independently, and (2) Group, where they engaged in multi-turn\ndiscussions in pairs or triads. In personal moral dilemmas, where agents must\ndecide to directly harm one individual to maximize the utility for others, all\nmodels found moral violations to be more acceptable when part of a group than\nindividually, similar to human experiments. Some models endorsed actions that\nmaximized overall well-being, even if they benefited strangers over familiar\nindividuals. Others became more willing to violate moral norms in groups.\nHowever, while human groups show a similar action bias, the mechanism for their\nutilitarian boost differs from LLMs. Whereas the human shift comes from\nheightened sensitivity to decision outcomes, LLM groups show either reduced\nnorm sensitivity or enhanced impartiality. This suggests that while the surface\nbehavior of LLM collectives mimics human group reasoning, the underlying\ndrivers differ.
