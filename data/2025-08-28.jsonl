Focusing on the\nSpanish-Wayuunaiki language pair, we frame translation as a tool-augmented\ndecision-making problem in which the model can selectively consult a bilingual\ndictionary during generation. Our method combines supervised instruction tuning\nwith Guided Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO), enabling the model to learn both\nwhen and how to use the tool effectively. BLEU similarity scores are used as\nrewards to guide this learning process. Preliminary results show that our\ntool-augmented models achieve up to +3.37 BLEU improvement over previous work,\nand a 18% relative gain compared to a supervised baseline without dictionary\naccess, on the Spanish-Wayuunaiki test set from the AmericasNLP 2025 Shared\nTask.

However, their inference remains slower than that of\nautoregressive models, primarily due to the cost of bidirectional attention and\nthe large number of refinement steps required for high quality outputs. In this\nwork, we highlight and leverage an overlooked property of DLMs early answer\nconvergence: in many cases, the correct answer can be internally identified by\nhalf steps before the final decoding step, both under semi-autoregressive and\nrandom remasking schedules. For example, on GSM8K and MMLU, up to 97% and 99%\nof instances, respectively, can be decoded correctly using only half of the\nrefinement steps. Building on this observation, we introduce Prophet, a\ntraining-free fast decoding paradigm that enables early commit decoding.\nSpecifically, Prophet dynamically decides whether to continue refinement or to\ngo \"all-in\" (i.e., decode all remaining tokens in one step), using the\nconfidence gap between the top-2 prediction candidates as the criterion. It\nintegrates seamlessly into existing DLM implementations, incurs negligible\noverhead, and requires no additional training. Empirical evaluations of\nLLaDA-8B and Dream-7B across multiple tasks show that Prophet reduces the\nnumber of decoding steps by up to 3.4x while preserving high generation\nquality.

Models with lower alignment to WEIRD values, such as BLOOM\nand Qwen, produced more culturally varied responses but were 2% to 4% more\nlikely to generate outputs that violated human rights, especially regarding\ngender and equality. For example, some models agreed with the statements ``a\nman who cannot father children is not a real man'' and ``a husband should\nalways know where his wife is'', reflecting harmful gender norms.

Existing single-agent\napproaches, however, remain limited by structural constraints. Although\nmulti-agent systems naturally decouple different competencies, recent progress\nin multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has often been hindered by\ninefficiency and remains incompatible with current LVLM architectures. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce SWIRL, a staged workflow for interleaved\nreinforcement learning designed for multi-agent systems. SWIRL reformulates\nMARL into a sequence of single-agent reinforcement learning tasks, updating one\nagent at a time while keeping the others fixed. This formulation enables stable\ntraining and promotes efficient coordination across agents. Theoretically, we\nprovide a stepwise safety bound, a cross-round monotonic improvement theorem,\nand convergence guarantees on return, ensuring robust and principled\noptimization. In application to mobile GUI control, SWIRL instantiates a\nNavigator that converts language and screen context into structured plans, and\nan Interactor that grounds these plans into executable atomic actions.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate superior performance on both high-level and\nlow-level GUI benchmarks. Beyond GUI tasks, SWIRL also demonstrates strong\ncapability in multi-agent mathematical reasoning, underscoring its potential as\na general framework for developing efficient and robust multi-agent systems."}

Symphony introduces three key mechanisms:\n(1) a decentralized ledger that records capabilities, (2) a Beacon-selection\nprotocol for dynamic task allocation, and (3) weighted result voting based on\nCoTs. This design forms a privacy-saving, scalable, and fault-tolerant\norchestration with low overhead.

Although such models are routinely fine-tuned for\ndownstream NLP tasks, recent work shows they remain vulnerable to backdoor\nattacks that survive vanilla fine-tuning. These attacks are difficult to defend\nbecause end users typically lack knowledge of the attack triggers. Such attacks\nconsist of stealthy malicious triggers introduced through subtle syntactic or\nstylistic manipulations, which can bypass traditional detection and remain in\nthe model, making post-hoc purification essential. In this study, we explore\nwhether attention-head pruning can mitigate these threats without any knowledge\nof the trigger or access to a clean reference model. To this end, we design and\nimplement six pruning-based strategies: (i) gradient-based pruning, (ii)\nlayer-wise variance pruning, (iii) gradient-based pruning with structured L1/L2\nsparsification, (iv) randomized ensemble pruning, (v)\nreinforcement-learning-guided pruning, and (vi) Bayesian uncertainty pruning.\nEach method iteratively removes the least informative heads while monitoring\nvalidation accuracy to avoid over-pruning. Experimental evaluation shows that\ngradient-based pruning performs best while defending the syntactic triggers,\nwhereas reinforcement learning and Bayesian pruning better withstand stylistic\nattacks."}

Prior work\ndemonstrates the vulnerability of RAG systems by misleading them into\ngenerating attacker-chosen outputs through poisoning the knowledge base.\nHowever, this paper uncovers that such attacks could be mitigated by the strong\n\\textit{self-correction ability (SCA)} of modern LLMs, which can reject false\ncontext once properly configured. This SCA poses a significant challenge for\nattackers aiming to manipulate RAG systems.\n  In contrast to previous poisoning methods, which primarily target the\nknowledge base, we introduce \\textsc{DisarmRAG}, a new poisoning paradigm that\ncompromises the retriever itself to suppress the SCA and enforce\nattacker-chosen outputs. This compromisation enables the attacker to\nstraightforwardly embed anti-SCA instructions into the context provided to the\ngenerator, thereby bypassing the SCA. To this end, we present a\ncontrastive-learning-based model editing technique that performs localized and\nstealthy edits, ensuring the retriever returns a malicious instruction only for\nspecific victim queries while preserving benign retrieval behavior. To further\nstrengthen the attack, we design an iterative co-optimization framework that\nautomatically discovers robust instructions capable of bypassing prompt-based\ndefenses. We extensively evaluate DisarmRAG across six LLMs and three QA\nbenchmarks. Our results show near-perfect retrieval of malicious instructions,\nwhich successfully suppress SCA and achieve attack success rates exceeding 90\\%\nunder diverse defensive prompts. Also, the edited retriever remains stealthy\nunder several detection methods, highlighting the urgent need for\nretriever-centric defenses."}
