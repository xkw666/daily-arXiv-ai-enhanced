Extending them to\ndensely interacting characters is highly challenging, as it demands precise\nspatial-temporal correspondence between the characters to maintain the\ninteraction, while creating natural transitions towards predefined keyposes. In\nthis research, we present a method for long-horizon interaction in-betweening\nthat enables two characters to engage and respond to one another naturally. To\neffectively represent and synthesize interactions, we propose a novel solution\ncalled Cross-Space In-Betweening, which models the interactions of each\ncharacter across different conditioning representation spaces. We further\nobserve that the significantly increased constraints in interacting characters\nheavily limit the solution space, leading to degraded motion quality and\ndiminished interaction over time. To enable long-horizon synthesis, we present\ntwo solutions to maintain long-term interaction and motion quality, thereby\nkeeping synthesis in the stable region of the solution space.We first sustain\ninteraction quality by identifying periodic interaction patterns through\nadversarial learning. We further maintain the motion quality by learning to\nrefine the drifted latent space and prevent pose error accumulation. We\ndemonstrate that our approach produces realistic, controllable, and\nlong-horizon in-between motions of two characters with dynamic boxing and\ndancing actions across multiple keyposes, supported by extensive quantitative\nevaluations and user studies."}

The current study was designed to investigate how\nimmersive VR presented through a head-mounted display (HMD) affects perceived\nfunctional body size using a passable aperture paradigm. Participants (n=60)\nperformed an action task (sidle through apertures) and a perception task\n(adjust aperture width until passable without contact) in both physical,\nunmediated reality (UR) and VR. Results revealed significantly higher action\nand perceptual thresholds in VR compared to UR. Affordance ratios (perceptual\nthreshold over action threshold) were also higher in VR, indicating that the\nincrease in perceptual thresholds in VR was driven partly by sensorimotor\nuncertainty, as reflected in the increase in the action thresholds, and partly\nby perceptual distortions imposed by VR. This perceptual overestimation in VR\nalso persisted as an aftereffect in UR following VR exposure. Geometrical\nmodelling attributed the disproportionate increase in the perceptual threshold\nin VR primarily to depth compression. This compression, stemming from the\nvergence-accommodation conflict (VAC), caused the virtual aperture to be\nperceived as narrower than depicted, thus requiring a wider adjusted aperture.\nCritically, after mathematically correcting for the VAC's impact on perceived\naperture width, the affordance ratios in VR became equivalent to those in UR.\nThese outcomes demonstrate a recovered invariant geometrical scaling,\nsuggesting that perception remained functionally attuned to action capabilities\nonce VAC-induced distortions were accounted for.

Existing\ncontext pruning techniques, such as LLMLingua, achieve promising results for\ngeneral text but overlook code-specific structures and dependencies, leading to\nsuboptimal performance in programming tasks. In this paper, we propose\nLongCodeZip, a novel plug-and-play code compression framework designed\nspecifically for code LLMs. LongCodeZip employs a dual-stage strategy: (1)\ncoarse-grained compression, which identifies and ranks function-level chunks\nusing conditional perplexity with respect to the instruction, retaining only\nthe most relevant functions; and (2) fine-grained compression, which segments\nretained functions into blocks based on perplexity and selects an optimal\nsubset under an adaptive token budget to maximize relevance. Evaluations across\nmultiple tasks, including code completion, summarization, and question\nanswering, show that LongCodeZip consistently outperforms baseline methods,\nachieving up to a 5.6x compression ratio without degrading task performance. By\neffectively reducing context size while preserving essential information,\nLongCodeZip enables LLMs to better scale to real-world, large-scale code\nscenarios, advancing the efficiency and capability of code intelligence\napplications."}

To address the scarcity of aligned corpora and the specificity of ETR\nconstraints, we propose a multi-task learning (MTL) approach that trains models\njointly on text summarization, text simplification, and ETR generation. We\nexplore two different strategies: multi-task retrieval-augmented generation\n(RAG) for in-context learning, and MTL-LoRA for parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning. Our experiments with Mistral-7B and LLaMA-3-8B, based on ETR-fr, a\nnew high-quality dataset, demonstrate the benefits of multi-task setups over\nsingle-task baselines across all configurations. Moreover, results show that\nthe RAG-based strategy enables generalization in out-of-domain settings, while\nMTL-LoRA outperforms all learning strategies within in-domain configurations."}

Lastly, GEM also functions\nas a convenient evaluation toolkit besides a training environment. We hope this\nframework can help accelerate future agentic LLM research."}

Intuitively, such\nrequirements are better addressed through the manipulation of a renderable\nenvironment, which can be explicitly controlled via logical commands (e.g.,\ncode). In this work, we propose Code2Video, a code-centric agent framework for\ngenerating educational videos via executable Python code. The framework\ncomprises three collaborative agents: (i) Planner, which structures lecture\ncontent into temporally coherent flows and prepares corresponding visual\nassets; (ii) Coder, which converts structured instructions into executable\nPython codes while incorporating scope-guided auto-fix to enhance efficiency;\nand (iii) Critic, which leverages vision-language models (VLM) with visual\nanchor prompts to refine spatial layout and ensure clarity. To support\nsystematic evaluation, we build MMMC, a benchmark of professionally produced,\ndiscipline-specific educational videos. We evaluate MMMC across diverse\ndimensions, including VLM-as-a-Judge aesthetic scores, code efficiency, and\nparticularly, TeachQuiz, a novel end-to-end metric that quantifies how well a\nVLM, after unlearning, can recover knowledge by watching the generated videos.\nOur results demonstrate the potential of Code2Video as a scalable,\ninterpretable, and controllable approach, achieving 40% improvement over direct\ncode generation and producing videos comparable to human-crafted tutorials.

To\naddress this gap, we introduce Toucan, the largest publicly available\ntool-agentic dataset to date, containing 1.5 million trajectories synthesized\nfrom nearly 500 real-world Model Context Protocols (MCPs).

Recent work ProRL has shown promise in scaling RL by increasing the\nnumber of training steps. However, performance plateaus after thousands of\nsteps, with clear diminishing returns from allocating more computation to\nadditional training. In this work, we investigate a complementary paradigm for\nscaling RL, BroR-Lincreasing the number of rollouts per example to hundreds to\nexhaustively Broaden exploration, which yields continuous performance gains\nbeyond the saturation point observed in ProRL when scaling the number of\ntraining steps. Our approach is motivated by a mass balance equation analysis\nallowing us to characterize the rate of change in probability mass for correct\nand incorrect tokens during the reinforcement process. We show that under a\none-step RL assumption, sampled rollout tokens always contribute to\ncorrect-mass expansion, while unsampled tokens outside rollouts may lead to\ngains or losses depending on their distribution and the net reward balance.\nImportantly, as the number of rollouts per example N increases, the effect of\nunsampled terms diminishes, ensuring overall correct-mass expansion. To\nvalidate our theoretical analysis, we conduct simulations under more relaxed\nconditions and find that a sufficiently large rollout size N-corresponding to\nample exploration-guarantees an increase in the probability mass of all correct\ntokens.
