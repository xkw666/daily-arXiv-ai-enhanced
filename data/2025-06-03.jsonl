This dataset captures rich linguistic and cultural diversity,\noffering a foundational resource for advancing multilingual and multicultural\nresearch. Furthermore, to address the issue that existing ASR evaluation\nmetrics lack sensitivity to code-switching scenarios, we propose the\n\\textbf{Semantic-Aware Error Rate (SAER)}, a novel evaluation metric that\nincorporates semantic information, providing a more accurate and context-aware\nassessment of system performance."}

We achieve this by defining a\nmultiplicative mixture between the dLLM marginal probabilities and the joint\nprobability of sequences under a small auxiliary autoregressive model. This\ninverts the standard setup of speculative decoding, where the goal is to sample\nfrom a large autoregressive verifier by drafting from a smaller model. We\nfurther optimize APD by enabling KV caching and limiting the size of the masked\ninput. Altogether, our method puts forward three tunable parameters to flexibly\ntradeoff throughput and quality. We show that APD provides markedly higher\nthroughput with minimal quality degradations on downstream benchmarks."}

In this paper, we employ tools from mechanistic\ninterpretability to trace how a large pretrained causal transformer\n(LLama3.2-1B-base) deals with this ambiguity. We localize three steps of idiom\nprocessing: First, the idiom's figurative meaning is retrieved in early\nattention and MLP sublayers. We identify specific attention heads which boost\nthe figurative meaning of the idiom while suppressing the idiom's literal\ninterpretation. The model subsequently represents the figurative representation\nthrough an intermediate path. Meanwhile, a parallel bypass route forwards\nliteral interpretation, ensuring that a both reading remain available.

Inspired by Benford's Law -- a statistical pattern\nwhere lower digits occur more frequently as leading digits -- we hypothesize\nthat the long-tailed digit distributions in web-collected corpora may be\nlearned by LLMs during pretraining, leading to biased numerical generation. To\ninvestigate the hypothesis, we first examine whether digits frequencies in\npretraining corpus (OLMo2) follows Benford's law. We then construct an\nevaluation benchmark with uniformly distributed ground-truth digits across\nseven numerical reasoning tasks. Our evaluation results demonstrate that\nleading open-source LLMs show a consistent pattern of digit bias that resembles\nBenford's law. Through logit-lens tracing and neuron-level dissection, we\nidentify that this bias arises predominantly from a small subset of highly\ndigit-selective feed-forward network (FFN) neurons in the deeper layers.\nFinally, we demonstrate that pruning these neurons mitigates imbalanced\novergeneration and partially corrects erroneous outputs, providing causal\nevidence that fine-grained pretraining digit bias can propagate into model\nbehavior.

While Large Reasoning\nModels (LRMs) can be employed to simulate character thought, their direct\napplication is hindered by attention diversion (i.e., RPAs forget their role)\nand style drift (i.e., overly formal and rigid reasoning rather than\ncharacter-consistent reasoning). To address these challenges, this paper\nintroduces a novel Role-Aware Reasoning (RAR) method, which consists of two\nimportant stages: Role Identity Activation (RIA) and Reasoning Style\nOptimization (RSO).

To\nfacilitate the study, we introduce ZhuangRules, a modularized dataset of\ngrammar rules and their corresponding test sentences. Our analysis reveals that\nrule retrieval constitutes a primary bottleneck in grammar-based translation.\nMoreover, although LLMs can apply simple rules for translation when explicitly\nprovided, they encounter difficulties in handling more complex rules.

Recent studies have revealed the potential of\ntraining open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to unleash LLMs' reasoning\nability for improving navigation, and simultaneously mitigate the domain gap\nbetween LLMs' training corpus and the VLN task. However, these approaches\nprimarily adopt direct input-output mapping paradigms, causing the mapping\nlearning difficult and the navigational decisions unexplainable.\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) training is a promising way to improve both navigational\ndecision accuracy and interpretability, while the complexity of the navigation\ntask makes the perfect CoT labels unavailable and may lead to overfitting\nthrough pure CoT supervised fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose a novel\nsElf-improving embodied reasoning framework for boosting LLM-based\nvision-language Navigation, dubbed EvolveNav. Our EvolveNav consists of two\nstages: (1) Formalized CoT Supervised Fine-Tuning, where we train the model\nwith formalized CoT labels to both activate the model's navigational reasoning\ncapabilities and increase the reasoning speed; (2) Self-Reflective\nPost-Training, where the model is iteratively trained with its own reasoning\noutputs as self-enriched CoT labels to enhance the supervision diversity. A\nself-reflective auxiliary task is also introduced to encourage learning correct\nreasoning patterns by contrasting with wrong ones. Experimental results on the\npopular VLN benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of EvolveNav over previous\nLLM-based VLN approaches. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/expectorlin/EvolveNav."}

Concurrently, the rise in computational cost for AI has motivated\nmodel compression techniques, notably quantization and sparsification, which\nhave emerged to mitigate the steep computational demands associated with\nlarge-scale training and inference. This paper investigates the interplay\nbetween scaling laws and compression formats, exploring whether a unified\nscaling framework can accurately predict model performance when training occurs\nover various compressed representations, such as sparse, scalar-quantized,\nsparse-quantized or even vector-quantized formats. Our key contributions\ninclude validating a general scaling law formulation and showing that it is\napplicable both individually but also composably across compression types.\nBased on this, our main finding is demonstrating both theoretically and\nempirically that there exists a simple \"capacity\" metric -- based on the\nrepresentation's ability to fit random Gaussian data -- which can robustly\npredict parameter efficiency across multiple compressed representations. On the\npractical side, we extend our formulation to directly compare the accuracy\npotential of different compressed formats, and to derive better algorithms for\ntraining over sparse-quantized formats."}

By\nproactively preventing models from acting on CoT indicating misaligned or\nharmful intent, CoT monitoring can be used to reduce risks associated with\ndeploying models. However, developers may be incentivized to train away the\nappearance of harmful intent from CoT traces, by either customer preferences or\nregulatory requirements. Recent works have shown that banning mention of a\nspecific example of reward hacking, which may be done either to make CoT\npresentable to users or as a naive attempt to prevent the behavior, causes\nobfuscation of the undesired reasoning traces but the persistence of the\nundesired behavior. Such obfuscation threatens the reliability of CoT\nmonitoring. However, obfuscation of reasoning can be due to its internalization\nto latent space computation, or its encoding within the CoT. Here, we provide\nan extension to these results. First, we show that penalizing the use of\nspecific strings within load-bearing reasoning traces causes models to\nsubstitute alternative strings. Crucially, this does not alter the underlying\nmethod by which the model performs the task, demonstrating that the model can\nlearn to steganographically encode its reasoning.
