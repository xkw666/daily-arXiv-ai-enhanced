Missing values in\ndata are a frequent challenge in most data generating domains and may cause a\nrange of analysis issues. Structural missingness in data may indicate issues in\ndata collection and pre-processing, but may also highlight important data\ncharacteristics. While research into statistical methods for dealing with\nmissing data are mainly focusing on replacing missing values with plausible\nestimated values, visualization has great potential to support a more in-depth\nunderstanding of missingness structures in data. Nonetheless, while the\ninterest in missing data visualization has increased in the last decade, it is\nstill a relatively overlooked research topic with a comparably small number of\npublications, few of which address scalability issues. Efficient visual\nanalysis approaches are needed to enable exploration of missingness structures\nin large and high-dimensional data, and to support informed decision-making in\ncontext of potential data quality issues. This paper suggests a set of quality\nmetrics for identification of patterns of interest for understanding of\nstructural missingness in data. These quality metrics can be used as guidance\nin visual analysis, as demonstrated through a use case exploring structural\nmissingness in data from a real-life walking monitoring study.

Furthermore, for robotics applications, the weights need to be chosen\nsuch that the policy performs well in the real world, despite inevitable\nsim-to-real gaps.

However,\npopular image vectorization tools struggle with occluded regions, producing\nincomplete or fragmented shapes that hinder editability. While recent\nadvancements have explored rule-based and data-driven layer-wise image\nvectorization, these methods face limitations in vectorization quality and\nflexibility. In this paper, we introduce LayerPeeler, a novel layer-wise image\nvectorization approach that addresses these challenges through a progressive\nsimplification paradigm. The key to LayerPeeler's success lies in its\nautoregressive peeling strategy: by identifying and removing the topmost\nnon-occluded layers while recovering underlying content, we generate vector\ngraphics with complete paths and coherent layer structures. Our method\nleverages vision-language models to construct a layer graph that captures\nocclusion relationships among elements, enabling precise detection and\ndescription for non-occluded layers. These descriptive captions are used as\nediting instructions for a finetuned image diffusion model to remove the\nidentified layers. To ensure accurate removal, we employ localized attention\ncontrol that precisely guides the model to target regions while faithfully\npreserving the surrounding content. To support this, we contribute a\nlarge-scale dataset specifically designed for layer peeling tasks.

However, within-label variation--cases where\nannotators agree on the same label but provide divergent reasoning--poses an\nadditional and mostly overlooked challenge. Several NLI datasets contain\nhighlighted words in the NLI item as explanations, but the same spans on the\nNLI item can be highlighted for different reasons, as evidenced by free-text\nexplanations, which offer a window into annotators' reasoning. To\nsystematically understand this problem and gain insight into the rationales\nbehind NLI labels, we introduce LITEX, a linguistically-informed taxonomy for\ncategorizing free-text explanations.

This\ntask becomes an emerging research issue in the era of large language models\n(LLMs) since real-world claims are often complex, featuring intricate semantic\nstructures or obfuscated entities. Traditional approaches typically address\nthis by decomposing claims into sub-claims and querying a knowledge base to\nresolve hidden or ambiguous entities.

To address these challenges, we propose\nVerify-in-the-Graph (VeGraph), a novel framework leveraging the reasoning and\ncomprehension abilities of LLM agents. VeGraph operates in three phases: (1)\nGraph Representation - an input claim is decomposed into structured triplets,\nforming a graph-based representation that integrates both structured and\nunstructured information; (2) Entity Disambiguation -VeGraph iteratively\ninteracts with the knowledge base to resolve ambiguous entities within the\ngraph for deeper sub-claim verification; and (3) Verification - remaining\ntriplets are verified to complete the fact-checking process.

However, their accessibility\nmakes them likely targets of test set contamination. In this work, we introduce\nDyePack, a framework that leverages backdoor attacks to identify models that\nused benchmark test sets during training, without requiring access to the loss,\nlogits, or any internal details of the model. Like how banks mix dye packs with\ntheir money to mark robbers, DyePack mixes backdoor samples with the test data\nto flag models that trained on it. We propose a principled design incorporating\nmultiple backdoors with stochastic targets, enabling exact false positive rate\n(FPR) computation when flagging every model. This provably prevents false\naccusations while providing strong evidence for every detected case of\ncontamination. We evaluate DyePack on five models across three datasets,\ncovering both multiple-choice and open-ended generation tasks. For\nmultiple-choice questions, it successfully detects all contaminated models with\nguaranteed FPRs as low as 0.000073% on MMLU-Pro and 0.000017% on Big-Bench-Hard\nusing eight backdoors.

Mainstream detection methods\neither identify poisoned samples by analyzing the prediction probability of\npoisoned classification models or rely on the rewriting model to eliminate the\nstealthy triggers. However, the former cannot be applied to generation tasks,\nwhile the latter may degrade generation performance and introduce new triggers.\nTherefore, efficiently eliminating stealthy poisoned samples for LLMs remains\nan urgent problem. We observe that after applying TF-IDF clustering to the\nsample response, there are notable differences in the intra-class distances\nbetween clean and poisoned samples. Poisoned samples tend to cluster closely\nbecause of their specific malicious outputs, whereas clean samples are more\nscattered due to their more varied responses. Thus, in this paper, we propose a\nstealthy backdoor sample detection method based on Reference-Filtration and\nTfidf-Clustering mechanisms (RFTC). Specifically, we first compare the sample\nresponse with the reference model's outputs and consider the sample suspicious\nif there's a significant discrepancy. And then we perform TF-IDF clustering on\nthese suspicious samples to identify the true poisoned samples based on the\nintra-class distance.

In this paper, we\nwork on the supposition that text itself in an image-caption dataset offers\nsufficient signals to accurately estimate these properties.

We then\npropose an unsupervised, distribution-free measure, which we call Neighborhood\nStability Measure (NSM), that quantifies the sharpness of peaks.

Recent studies have explored prompting-based strategies that\nincorporate verification or feedback loops using proprietary models, as well as\ntraining-based methods that leverage their strong reasoning capabilities.\nHowever, whether smaller models possess the capacity to effectively guide their\noutputs through self-reflection remains unexplored. Our findings reveal that\nsmaller models struggle to exhibit reflective revision behavior across both\nself-correction paradigms.

Querying\napproaches from a vast body of scientific papers is extremely time-consuming,\nand without a well-organized management framework, researchers may face\nsignificant challenges in querying and utilizing relevant approaches.\nConstructing multiple dimensions on approaches and managing them from these\ndimensions can provide an efficient solution. Firstly, this paper identifies\napproach patterns using a top-down way, refining the patterns through four\ndistinct linguistic levels: semantic level, discourse level, syntactic level,\nand lexical level. Approaches in scientific papers are extracted based on\napproach patterns. Additionally, five dimensions for categorizing approaches\nare identified using these patterns. This paper proposes using tree structure\nto represent step and measuring the similarity between different steps with a\ntree-structure-based similarity measure that focuses on syntactic-level\nsimilarities. A collection similarity measure is proposed to compute the\nsimilarity between approaches. A bottom-up clustering algorithm is proposed to\nconstruct class trees for approach components within each dimension by merging\neach approach component or class with its most similar approach component or\nclass in each iteration. The class labels generated during the clustering\nprocess indicate the common semantics of the step components within the\napproach components in each class and are used to manage the approaches within\nthe class. The class trees of the five dimensions collectively form a\nmulti-dimensional approach space.

Additionally, the study\nintroduced a distraction framework to assess the fragility of these models. The\nframework incorporated simple, irrelevant distractor statements containing\npolysemous words with clinical meanings used in non-clinical contexts to\ndetermine the extent to which such distractions degrade model performance on\nstandard medical benchmarks. 6 of the 28 tested LLMs achieved board-passing\noutcomes, with the top-performing models scoring over 15.7% above the passing\nthreshold. When exposed to distractions, accuracy across various model\narchitectures was significantly reduced-by as much as 20.4%-with one model\nfailing that had previously passed. Both general-purpose and medical\nopen-source models experienced greater performance declines compared to\nproprietary variants when subjected to the added distractors. While current\nLLMs demonstrate an impressive ability to answer neurosurgery board-like exam\nquestions, their performance is markedly vulnerable to extraneous, distracting\ninformation. These findings underscore the critical need for developing novel\nmitigation strategies aimed at bolstering LLM resilience against in-text\ndistractions, particularly for safe and effective clinical deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f3028\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u5916\u79d1\u8003\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u6613\u53d7\u591a\u4e49\u5e72\u6270\u8bed\u53e5\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u7b56\u7565\u786e\u4fdd\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b89\u5168", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u5916\u79d1\u8003\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u638c\u63e1\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5176\u5bf9\u542b\u591a\u4e49\u5e72\u6270\u8bed\u53e5\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e", "method": "\u4f7f\u752828\u4e2aLLMs\u6d4b\u8bd52904\u9053CNS-SANS\u8bd5\u9898\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u542b\u975e\u4e34\u5e8a\u591a\u4e49\u5e72\u6270\u8bcd\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u6846\u67b6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u8106\u5f31\u6027", "result": "6\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u8003\u8bd5\uff08\u6700\u9ad8\u8d85\u53ca\u683c\u7ebf15.7%\uff09\uff0c\u5e72\u6270\u4f7f\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6700\u5927\u4e0b\u964d20.4%\uff0c\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u5546\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u964d\u5e45\u66f4\u5927", "conclusion": "\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u578b\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u7b56\u7565\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u90e8\u7f72\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981"}}

As\nthese LRMs are mostly developed by post-training on formal reasoning tasks,\nwhether they generalize the reasoning capability to help reduce hallucination\nin fact-seeking tasks remains unclear and debated. For instance, DeepSeek-R1\nreports increased performance on SimpleQA, a fact-seeking benchmark, while\nOpenAI-o3 observes even severer hallucination. This discrepancy naturally\nraises the following research question: Are reasoning models more prone to\nhallucination? This paper addresses the question from three perspectives. (1)\nWe first conduct a holistic evaluation for the hallucination in LRMs. Our\nanalysis reveals that LRMs undergo a full post-training pipeline with cold\nstart supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and verifiable reward RL generally alleviate\ntheir hallucination. In contrast, both distillation alone and RL training\nwithout cold start fine-tuning introduce more nuanced hallucinations. (2) To\nexplore why different post-training pipelines alters the impact on\nhallucination in LRMs, we conduct behavior analysis. We characterize two\ncritical cognitive behaviors that directly affect the factuality of a LRM: Flaw\nRepetition, where the surface-level reasoning attempts repeatedly follow the\nsame underlying flawed logic, and Think-Answer Mismatch, where the final answer\nfails to faithfully match the previous CoT process. (3) Further, we investigate\nthe mechanism behind the hallucination of LRMs from the perspective of model\nuncertainty.

However, such metrics conflate two distinct sub-skills: abstract\nformulation (capturing mathematical relationships using expressions) and\narithmetic computation (executing the calculations). Through a disentangled\nevaluation on GSM8K and SVAMP, we find that the final-answer accuracy of\nLlama-3 and Qwen2.5 (1B-32B) without CoT is overwhelmingly bottlenecked by the\narithmetic computation step and not by the abstract formulation step.

Success in these contexts depends on a model's social\nreasoning ability - the capacity to interpret social contexts, infer others'\nmental states, and assess the truthfulness of presented information. However,\nthere is currently no systematic evaluation framework that comprehensively\nassesses the social reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Existing efforts often\noversimplify real-world scenarios and consist of tasks that are too basic to\nchallenge advanced models. To address this gap, we introduce SocialMaze, a new\nbenchmark specifically designed to evaluate social reasoning. SocialMaze\nsystematically incorporates three core challenges: deep reasoning, dynamic\ninteraction, and information uncertainty. It provides six diverse tasks across\nthree key settings: social reasoning games, daily-life interactions, and\ndigital community platforms. Both automated and human validation are used to\nensure data quality. Our evaluation reveals several key insights: models vary\nsubstantially in their ability to handle dynamic interactions and integrate\ntemporally evolving information; models with strong chain-of-thought reasoning\nperform better on tasks requiring deeper inference beyond surface-level cues;\nand model reasoning degrades significantly under uncertainty.

To better\nunderstand these capabilities, we propose to decompose problem solving into\nfundamental capabilities: Plan (mapping questions to sequences of steps),\nExecute (correctly performing solution steps), and Verify (identifying the\ncorrectness of a solution). Empirically, we find that GRPO mainly enhances the\nexecution skill-improving execution robustness on problems the model already\nknows how to solve-a phenomenon we call temperature distillation.

We then suggest that current\nlarge language model (LLM) architectures, constraints, and affordances may\nimpose fundamental limitations on achieving full conversational alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63a2\u8ba8AI\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4ee3\u7406\u5982\u4f55\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6c9f\u901a\u89c4\u8303\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u63d0\u51faCONTEXT-ALIGN\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u5e76\u6307\u51faLLM\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684AI\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4ee3\u7406\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u5f15\u53d1\u5bf9AI\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5982\u4f55\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u6c9f\u901a\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u601d\u8003\uff0c\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u786e\u4fdd\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4ee3\u7406\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bed\u5883\u5904\u7406\u4e60\u60ef", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u54f2\u5b66\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u7684\u4f1a\u8bdd\u8bed\u7528\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u6784\u5efaCONTEXT-ALIGN\u6846\u67b6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u5206\u6790LLM\u67b6\u6784\u5bf9\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u9650\u5236", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709LLM\u5728\u8bed\u5883\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u5171\u540c\u57fa\u7840\u5efa\u7acb\u7b49\u6838\u5fc3\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8981\u7d20\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u67b6\u6784\u6027\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b8c\u5168\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5bf9\u9f50", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u8bae\u5728LLM\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u52a0\u5f3a\u8bed\u5883\u654f\u611f\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9700\u8981\u7a81\u7834\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u9650\u5236\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u6b63\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u6c9f\u901a\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4ee3\u7406"}}

Existing pruning methods primarily focus on estimating the\nimportance of individual weights, which limits their ability to preserve\ncritical capabilities of the model. In this work, we propose a new perspective:\nrather than merely selecting which weights to prune, we first redistribute\nparameter importance to make the model inherently more amenable to pruning. By\nminimizing the information entropy of normalized importance scores, our\napproach concentrates importance onto a smaller subset of weights, thereby\nenhancing pruning robustness. We instantiate this idea through DenoiseRotator,\nwhich applies learnable orthogonal transformations to the model's weight\nmatrices. Our method is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated with\nexisting pruning techniques such as Magnitude, SparseGPT, and Wanda.

A Framework for Auditing Unlearning in LLMs", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "comment": null, "summary": "In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable\nadvancements, drawing significant attention from the research community. Their\ncapabilities are largely attributed to large-scale architectures, which require\nextensive training on massive datasets.

Regulatory frameworks, such as the\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), grant individuals the right to\nrequest the removal of such sensitive information. This has motivated the\ndevelopment of machine unlearning algorithms that aim to remove specific\nknowledge from models without the need for costly retraining. Despite these\nadvancements, evaluating the efficacy of unlearning algorithms remains a\nchallenge due to the inherent complexity and generative nature of LLMs. In this\nwork, we introduce a comprehensive auditing framework for unlearning\nevaluation, comprising three benchmark datasets, six unlearning algorithms, and\nfive prompt-based auditing methods. By using various auditing algorithms, we\nevaluate the effectiveness and robustness of different unlearning strategies.\nTo explore alternatives beyond prompt-based auditing, we propose a novel\ntechnique that leverages intermediate activation perturbations, addressing the\nlimitations of auditing methods that rely solely on model inputs and outputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7efc\u5408\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9057\u5fd8\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u591a\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ca\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6270\u52a8\u6280\u672f", "motivation": "\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5e38\u5305\u542b\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\u9700\u5408\u89c4\u5220\u9664\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u9057\u5fd8\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u516d\u79cd\u9057\u5fd8\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u4e94\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e2d\u95f4\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6280\u672f", "result": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0d\u540c\u9057\u5fd8\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7a81\u7834\u4f20\u7edf\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684\u9650\u5236", "conclusion": "\u4e2d\u95f4\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6270\u52a8\u6280\u672f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u9057\u5fd8\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u5ba1\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u601d\u8def"}}

Therefore, PRMs are required to identify errors under various\nreasoning patterns during the reasoning process. However, existing benchmarks\nmainly focus on evaluating PRMs with stepwise correctness, ignoring a\nsystematic evaluation of PRMs under various reasoning patterns.

Consequently, even when trained for\nstep-by-step reasoning, they can ignore the thinking process in deriving the\nfinal answer. \\textit{Fourthly,} we observe that complex reasoning patterns\nappear to be pre-existing rather than emergent, with their frequency increasing\nalongside training and task difficulty. \\textit{Finally,} our results\ndemonstrate that RL exhibits more effective generalization than Supervised\nFine-Tuning (SFT), and an initial SFT cold start phase can hinder subsequent RL\noptimization. Although these observations are based on jigsaw puzzles and may\nvary across other visual tasks, this research contributes a valuable piece of\njigsaw to the larger puzzle of collective understanding rule-based visual RL\nand its potential in multimodal learning.

Despite\nits empirical success, the theoretical justification behind its log-ratio\nreward parameterization remains incomplete. In this work, we address this gap\nby utilizing the Differential Information Distribution (DID): a distribution\nover token sequences that captures the information gained during policy\nupdates. First, we show that when preference labels encode the differential\ninformation required to transform a reference policy into a target policy, the\nlog-ratio reward in DPO emerges as the uniquely optimal form for learning the\ntarget policy via preference optimization. This result naturally yields a\nclosed-form expression for the optimal sampling distribution over rejected\nresponses. Second, we find that the condition for preferences to encode\ndifferential information is fundamentally linked to an implicit assumption\nregarding log-margin ordered policies-an inductive bias widely used in\npreference optimization yet previously unrecognized. Finally, by analyzing the\nentropy of the DID, we characterize how learning low-entropy differential\ninformation reinforces the policy distribution, while high-entropy differential\ninformation induces a smoothing effect, which explains the log-likelihood\ndisplacement phenomenon. We validate our theoretical findings in synthetic\nexperiments and extend them to real-world instruction-following datasets. Our\nresults suggest that learning high-entropy differential information is crucial\nfor general instruction-following, while learning low-entropy differential\ninformation benefits knowledge-intensive question answering. Overall, our work\npresents a unifying perspective on the DPO objective, the structure of\npreference data, and resulting policy behaviors through the lens of\ndifferential information.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ece\u5dee\u5206\u4fe1\u606f\u5206\u5e03\u89c6\u89d2\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u91caDPO\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u673a\u7406\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u9690\u542b\u7684log-margin\u6709\u5e8f\u7b56\u7565\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u71b5\u5206\u6790\u89e3\u91ca\u7b56\u7565\u884c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5f02", "motivation": "DPO\u7b97\u6cd5\u867d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u4f46\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u5176\u5bf9\u6570\u6bd4\u5956\u52b1\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u8054\u7cfb", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5dee\u5206\u4fe1\u606f\u5206\u5e03(DID)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u504f\u597d\u6807\u7b7e\u7f16\u7801\u5dee\u5206\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6log-ratio\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6027\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e0elog-margin\u6709\u5e8f\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7DID\u71b5\u503c\u5206\u6790\u7b56\u7565\u5f3a\u5316/\u5e73\u6ed1\u6548\u5e94", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u8bc1\u660eDPO\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u552f\u4e00\u6700\u4f18\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9ad8\u71b5\u5dee\u5206\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u5347\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f4e\u71b5\u5dee\u5206\u4fe1\u606f\u5f3a\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u95ee\u7b54\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5dee\u5206\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u91caDPO\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6"}}

Existing benchmarks, however,\nprobe only single-image relations and thus fail to assess the multi-image\nspatial reasoning that real-world deployments demand. We introduce MMSI-Bench,\na VQA benchmark dedicated to multi-image spatial intelligence. Six 3D-vision\nresearchers spent more than 300 hours meticulously crafting 1,000 challenging,\nunambiguous multiple-choice questions from over 120,000 images, each paired\nwith carefully designed distractors and a step-by-step reasoning process.

These results underscore the challenging nature of MMSI-Bench\nand the substantial headroom for future research. Leveraging the annotated\nreasoning processes, we also provide an automated error analysis pipeline that\ndiagnoses four dominant failure modes, including (1) grounding errors, (2)\noverlap-matching and scene-reconstruction errors, (3) situation-transformation\nreasoning errors, and (4) spatial-logic errors, offering valuable insights for\nadvancing multi-image spatial intelligence.
