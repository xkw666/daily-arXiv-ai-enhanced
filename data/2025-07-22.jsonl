Neural rendering\nis an emerging technique that enables photo-realistic image synthesis from\npreviously unobserved viewpoints; however, state-of-the-art neural rendering\nmethods have difficulty efficiently rendering a high complex large-scale scene\nbecause these methods typically trade scene size, fidelity, and rendering speed\nfor quality. The other stream of techniques utilizes scene geometries for\nreconstruction. But the cost of building and maintaining a large set of\ngeometry data increases as scene size grows. Our work explores novel view\nsynthesis methods that efficiently reconstruct complex scenes without explicit\nuse of scene geometries. Specifically, given sparse images of the scene\n(captured from the real world), we reconstruct intermediate, multi-scale,\nimplicit representations of scene geometries. In this way, our method avoids\nexplicitly relying on scene geometry, significantly reducing the computational\ncost of maintaining large 3D data. Unlike current methods, we reconstruct the\nscene using a probe data structure. Probe data hold highly accurate depth\ninformation of dense data points, enabling the reconstruction of highly complex\nscenes. By reconstructing the scene using probe data, the rendering cost is\nindependent of the complexity of the scene. As such, our approach combines\ngeometry reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Moreover, when rendering\nlarge-scale scenes, compressing and streaming probe data is more efficient than\nusing explicit scene geometry. Therefore, our neural representation approach\ncan potentially be applied to virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR)\napplications."}

Recent works introduce the signed distance field (SDF) as an extra\ncontinuous representation to regularize the geometry defined by Gaussian\nprimitives. It improves the decomposition quality, at the cost of increasing\nmemory usage and complicating training. Unlike these works, we introduce a\ndiscretized SDF to represent the continuous SDF in a discrete manner by\nencoding it within each Gaussian using a sampled value. This approach allows us\nto link the SDF with the Gaussian opacity through an SDF-to-opacity\ntransformation, enabling rendering the SDF via splatting and avoiding the\ncomputational cost of ray marching.The key challenge is to regularize the\ndiscrete samples to be consistent with the underlying SDF, as the discrete\nrepresentation can hardly apply the gradient-based constraints (\\eg Eikonal\nloss).

This paper presents a review\nof publicly available Arabic post-training datasets on the Hugging Face Hub,\norganized along four key dimensions: (1) LLM Capabilities (e.g., Question\nAnswering, Translation, Reasoning, Summarization, Dialogue, Code Generation,\nand Function Calling); (2) Steerability (e.g., persona and system prompts); (3)\nAlignment (e.g., cultural, safety, ethics, and fairness), and (4) Robustness.\nEach dataset is rigorously evaluated based on popularity, practical adoption,\nrecency and maintenance, documentation and annotation quality, licensing\ntransparency, and scientific contribution. Our review revealed critical gaps in\nthe development of Arabic post-training datasets, including limited task\ndiversity, inconsistent or missing documentation and annotation, and low\nadoption across the community.

As a\nresult, many studies rely on available pre-labeled datasets without examining\ntheir annotation process or label reliability. The lack of datasets in other\nlanguages further limits the global realization of suicide prevention via\nartificial intelligence (AI). In this study, we address one of these gaps by\nconstructing a novel Turkish suicidal ideation corpus derived from social media\nposts and introducing a resource-efficient annotation framework involving three\nhuman annotators and two large language models (LLMs). We then address the\nremaining gaps by performing a bidirectional evaluation of label reliability\nand model consistency across this dataset and three popular English suicidal\nideation detection datasets, using transfer learning through eight pre-trained\nsentiment and emotion classifiers. These transformers help assess annotation\nconsistency and benchmark model performance against manually labeled data.

In this work, we propose Penalty-Adjusted\nType-Token Ratio (PATTR), a diversity metric robust to length variations. We\ngenerate a large synthetic corpus of over 20M words using seven models from the\nLLaMA, OLMo, and Phi families, focusing on a creative writing task of video\nscript generation, where diversity is crucial. We evaluate per-response lexical\ndiversity using PATTR and compare it against existing metrics of Moving-Average\nTTR (MATTR) and Compression Ratio (CR). Our analysis highlights how text length\nvariations introduce biases favoring shorter responses. Unlike existing\nmetrics, PATTR explicitly considers the task-specific target response length\n($L_T$) to effectively mitigate length biases.

Thus, integrating an unspoken thought\nprocess into SLMs is highly desirable. While naively generating a complete\nchain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before starting to talk can enable thinking\nfor SLMs, this induces additional latency for the speech response, as the CoT\nreasoning can be arbitrarily long. To solve this issue, we propose Stitch, a\nnovel generation method that alternates between the generation of unspoken\nreasoning chunks and spoken response chunks. Since the audio duration of a\nchunk of spoken response is much longer than the time to generate the tokens in\na chunk of spoken response, we use the remaining free time to generate the\nunspoken reasoning tokens. When a chunk of audio is played to the user, the\nmodel continues to generate the next unspoken reasoning chunk, achieving\nsimultaneous thinking and talking.

This study presents a theoretical and empirical\ninvestigation that provides fresh insights into the potential limits of RLVR.\nFirst, we offer a new theoretical perspective that RLVR is constrained by the\nbase model's support-unable to sample solutions with zero initial\nprobability-and operates as a conservative reweighting mechanism that may\nrestrict the discovery of entirely original solutions. We also identify an\nentropy-reward tradeoff: while RLVR reliably enhances precision, it may\nprogressively narrow exploration and potentially overlook correct yet\nunderrepresented solutions. Extensive empirical experiments validate that while\nRLVR consistently improves pass@1, the shrinkage of empirical support generally\noutweighs the expansion of empirical support under larger sampling budgets,\nfailing to recover correct answers that were previously accessible to the base\nmodel. Interestingly, we also observe that while RLVR sometimes increases\ntoken-level entropy, resulting in greater uncertainty at each generation step,\nanswer-level entropy declines, indicating that these seemingly more uncertain\npaths ultimately converge onto a smaller set of distinct answers.
