Neural rendering\nis an emerging technique that enables photo-realistic image synthesis from\npreviously unobserved viewpoints; however, state-of-the-art neural rendering\nmethods have difficulty efficiently rendering a high complex large-scale scene\nbecause these methods typically trade scene size, fidelity, and rendering speed\nfor quality. The other stream of techniques utilizes scene geometries for\nreconstruction. But the cost of building and maintaining a large set of\ngeometry data increases as scene size grows. Our work explores novel view\nsynthesis methods that efficiently reconstruct complex scenes without explicit\nuse of scene geometries. Specifically, given sparse images of the scene\n(captured from the real world), we reconstruct intermediate, multi-scale,\nimplicit representations of scene geometries. In this way, our method avoids\nexplicitly relying on scene geometry, significantly reducing the computational\ncost of maintaining large 3D data. Unlike current methods, we reconstruct the\nscene using a probe data structure. Probe data hold highly accurate depth\ninformation of dense data points, enabling the reconstruction of highly complex\nscenes. By reconstructing the scene using probe data, the rendering cost is\nindependent of the complexity of the scene. As such, our approach combines\ngeometry reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Moreover, when rendering\nlarge-scale scenes, compressing and streaming probe data is more efficient than\nusing explicit scene geometry. Therefore, our neural representation approach\ncan potentially be applied to virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR)\napplications."}

Recent works introduce the signed distance field (SDF) as an extra\ncontinuous representation to regularize the geometry defined by Gaussian\nprimitives. It improves the decomposition quality, at the cost of increasing\nmemory usage and complicating training. Unlike these works, we introduce a\ndiscretized SDF to represent the continuous SDF in a discrete manner by\nencoding it within each Gaussian using a sampled value. This approach allows us\nto link the SDF with the Gaussian opacity through an SDF-to-opacity\ntransformation, enabling rendering the SDF via splatting and avoiding the\ncomputational cost of ray marching.The key challenge is to regularize the\ndiscrete samples to be consistent with the underlying SDF, as the discrete\nrepresentation can hardly apply the gradient-based constraints (\\eg Eikonal\nloss).

A common workaround is to translate existing English\nalignment data; however, standard translation techniques often fail to preserve\ncritical elements such as code, mathematical expressions, and structured\nformats like JSON. In this work, we investigate LLM-based selective\ntranslation, a technique that selectively translates only the translatable\nparts of a text while preserving non-translatable content and sentence\nstructure. We conduct a systematic study to explore key questions around this\napproach, including its effectiveness compared to vanilla translation, the\nimportance of filtering noisy outputs, and the benefits of mixing translated\nsamples with original English data during alignment.

This workshop\npaper extends the previous research by highlighting that the AudiBERT model not\nonly improved the classification of classes that were sparse in the dataset,\nbut it also had statistically significant class-wise improvements over the BERT\nmodel for classifications in the social-cognitive dimension. However, similar\nsignificant class-wise improvements over the BERT model were not observed for\nclassifications in the affective dimension.

As a\nresult, many studies rely on available pre-labeled datasets without examining\ntheir annotation process or label reliability. The lack of datasets in other\nlanguages further limits the global realization of suicide prevention via\nartificial intelligence (AI). In this study, we address one of these gaps by\nconstructing a novel Turkish suicidal ideation corpus derived from social media\nposts and introducing a resource-efficient annotation framework involving three\nhuman annotators and two large language models (LLMs). We then address the\nremaining gaps by performing a bidirectional evaluation of label reliability\nand model consistency across this dataset and three popular English suicidal\nideation detection datasets, using transfer learning through eight pre-trained\nsentiment and emotion classifiers. These transformers help assess annotation\nconsistency and benchmark model performance against manually labeled data.

Large language and multimodal models have achieved remarkable\ncapabilities, but their reliance on massive training datasets creates a\nfundamental mismatch with children, who succeed in acquiring language from\ncomparatively limited input. To help bridge this gap, researchers have\nincreasingly trained neural networks using data similar in quantity and quality\nto children's input. Taking this approach to the limit, Vong et al. (2024)\nshowed that a multimodal neural network trained on 61 hours of visual and\nlinguistic input extracted from just one child's developmental experience could\nacquire word-referent mappings. However, whether this approach's success\nreflects the idiosyncrasies of a single child's experience, or whether it would\nshow consistent and robust learning patterns across multiple children's\nexperiences was not explored.

Thus, integrating an unspoken thought\nprocess into SLMs is highly desirable.

To solve this issue, we propose Stitch, a\nnovel generation method that alternates between the generation of unspoken\nreasoning chunks and spoken response chunks. Since the audio duration of a\nchunk of spoken response is much longer than the time to generate the tokens in\na chunk of spoken response, we use the remaining free time to generate the\nunspoken reasoning tokens.

This study presents a theoretical and empirical\ninvestigation that provides fresh insights into the potential limits of RLVR.\nFirst, we offer a new theoretical perspective that RLVR is constrained by the\nbase model's support-unable to sample solutions with zero initial\nprobability-and operates as a conservative reweighting mechanism that may\nrestrict the discovery of entirely original solutions. We also identify an\nentropy-reward tradeoff: while RLVR reliably enhances precision, it may\nprogressively narrow exploration and potentially overlook correct yet\nunderrepresented solutions. Extensive empirical experiments validate that while\nRLVR consistently improves pass@1, the shrinkage of empirical support generally\noutweighs the expansion of empirical support under larger sampling budgets,\nfailing to recover correct answers that were previously accessible to the base\nmodel. Interestingly, we also observe that while RLVR sometimes increases\ntoken-level entropy, resulting in greater uncertainty at each generation step,\nanswer-level entropy declines, indicating that these seemingly more uncertain\npaths ultimately converge onto a smaller set of distinct answers.
