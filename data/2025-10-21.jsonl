In some\ncases, OOD performance follows the same trend as ID, but in others, diversity\nbecomes essential for non-trivial factual recall. Even when low diversity\nprohibits factual recall, optimal diversity levels depend on training duration.\nBeyond factual recall failures, we identify structures where statistical\ngeneralization fails independently, and others where both capabilities degrade.\nThis shows how the interplay between contextual design and diversity level\nimpacts different generalization aspects.

To address these challenges, we introduce a generic\nneuro-symbolic approach, which we call Autonomous Trustworthy Agents (ATA). The\ncore of our approach lies in decoupling tasks into two distinct phases: Offline\nknowledge ingestion and online task processing. During knowledge ingestion, an\nLLM translates an informal problem specification into a formal, symbolic\nknowledge base. This formal representation is crucial as it can be verified and\nrefined by human experts, ensuring its correctness and alignment with domain\nrequirements. In the subsequent task processing phase, each incoming input is\nencoded into the same formal language.

By dynamically\ntesting candidate components and modeling their utility in real-time, our\napproach streamlines the assembly of agentic systems and facilitates scalable\nreuse of resources. Empirical evaluation with Claude 3.5 Sonnet across five\nbenchmarking datasets shows that our online-knapsack-based composer\nconsistently lies on the Pareto frontier, achieving higher success rates at\nsignificantly lower component costs compared to our baselines. In the\nsingle-agent setup, the online knapsack composer shows a success rate\nimprovement of up to 31.6% in comparison to the retrieval baselines. In\nmulti-agent systems, the online knapsack composer increases success rate from\n37% to 87% when agents are selected from an agent inventory of 100+ agents. The\nsubstantial performance gap confirms the robust adaptability of our method\nacross diverse domains and budget constraints."}

The\nsubsequent phase performs a full-text analysis to assign secondary\nclassifications, revealing latent, cross-topic connections across the corpus.\nTraditional natural language processing (NLP) methods, such as Bag-of-Words\n(BoW) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), confirm the\nresulting topical structure and also suggest that standalone word-frequency\nanalyses may be insufficient for mapping fields with high diversity. Finally, a\ndisjoint graph representation between the primary and secondary classifications\nreveals implicit connections between themes that may be less apparent when\nanalyzing abstracts or keywords alone. The findings show that the approach\nindependently recovers much of the journal's editorially embedded structure\nwithout prior knowledge of its existing dual-classification schema (e.g.,\nbiological studies also classified as engineering). This framework offers a\npowerful tool for detecting potential thematic trends and providing a\nhigh-level overview of scientific progress."}

To tackle high-complexity data science\ntasks, we propose a curriculum-based agentic training paradigm that emulates\nthe learning trajectory of human data scientists, enabling LLMs to\nprogressively acquire and integrate multiple capabilities in real-world\nenvironments. We also introduce a data-grounded trajectory synthesis framework\nthat constructs high-quality training data. Through agentic training,\nDeepAnalyze learns to perform a broad spectrum of data tasks, ranging from data\nquestion answering and specialized analytical tasks to open-ended data\nresearch. Experiments demonstrate that, with only 8B parameters, DeepAnalyze\noutperforms previous workflow-based agents built on most advanced proprietary\nLLMs. The model, code, and training data of DeepAnalyze are open-sourced,\npaving the way toward autonomous data science."}

In practice, SFT on a full dataset\nis computationally expensive and sometimes suffers from overfitting or bias\namplification. This facilitates the rise of data curation in SFT, which\nprioritizes the most valuable data to optimze. This work studies the online\nbatch selection family that dynamically scores and filters samples during the\ntraining process. However, existing popular methods often (i) rely merely on\nthe utility of data to select a subset while neglecting other crucial factors\nlike diversity, (ii) rely on external resources such as reference models or\nvalidation sets, and (iii) incur extra training time over full-dataset\ntraining. To address these limitations, this work develops \\textbf{UDS\n(Utility-Diversity Sampling)}, a framework for efficient online batch selection\nin SFT. UDS leverages the nuclear norm of the logits matrix to capture both\ndata utility and intra-sample diversity, while estimating inter-sample\ndiversity through efficient low-dimensional embedding comparisons with a\nlightweight memory buffer of historical samples. Such a design eliminates the\nneed for external resources and unnecessary backpropagation, securing\ncomputational efficiency.

The LLM reveals an \\emph{observable\nsignal} $Z$ that potentially leaks hints for attacking through a response\ncontaining answer tokens, thinking process tokens, or logits. Yet the scale of\ninformation leaked remains anecdotal, leaving auditors without principled\nguidance and defenders blind to the transparency--risk trade-off. We fill this\ngap with an information-theoretic framework that computes how much information\ncan be safely disclosed, and enables auditors to gauge how close their methods\ncome to the fundamental limit. Treating the mutual information $I(Z;T)$ between\nthe observation $Z$ and the target property $T$ as the leaked bits per query,\nwe show that achieving error $\\varepsilon$ requires at least\n$\\log(1/\\varepsilon)/I(Z;T)$ queries, scaling linearly with the inverse leak\nrate and only logarithmically with the desired accuracy.

We introduce DELULU, a speaker-aware self-supervised\nfoundational model that addresses this limitation by integrating external\nsupervision into the pseudo-label generation process. DELULU leverages\nframe-level embeddings from ReDimNet, a state-of-the-art speaker verification\nmodel, to guide the k-means clustering step during pre-training, introducing a\nstrong speaker-discriminative inductive bias that aligns representation\nlearning with speaker identity. The model is trained using a dual objective\nthat combines masked prediction and denoising, further enhancing robustness and\ngeneralization. DELULU significantly outperforms prior self-supervised learning\n(SSL) models across a range of speaker-centric tasks, achieving up to 62%\nrelative improvement in equal error rate (EER) for speaker verification and\nconsistent gains on zero-shot profiling tasks such as gender, age, accent, and\nspeaker counting. Our findings demonstrate that DELULU is a strong universal\nencoder for speaker-aware speech processing, enabling superior performance even\nwithout task-specific fine-tuning."}

We propose a language-in-the-loop framework that uses a large\nlanguage model (LLM) to convert unstructured feedback in the form of natural\nlanguage into scalar utilities to conduct BO over a numeric search space.\nUnlike preferential BO, which only accepts restricted feedback formats and\nrequires customized models for each domain-specific problem, our approach\nleverages LLMs to turn varied types of textual feedback into consistent utility\nsignals and to easily include flexible user priors without manual kernel\ndesign. At the same time, our method maintains the sample efficiency and\nprincipled uncertainty quantification of BO. We show that this hybrid method\nnot only provides a more natural interface to the decision maker but also\noutperforms conventional BO baselines and LLM-only optimizers, particularly in\nfeedback-limited regimes."}

To address these limitations, we introduce VERA-V, a\nvariational inference framework that recasts multimodal jailbreak discovery as\nlearning a joint posterior distribution over paired text-image prompts.

Not all forgetting is equal: Forgetting one fact (e.g., a U.S.\npresident or an API call) does not \"average out\" by recalling another. Hence,\nwe propose a sample-wise paradigm to measure what is forgotten and when\nbackward transfer occurs. Our metric counts 1->0 transitions (correct before\npost-training, incorrect after) to quantify forgetting and 0->1 transitions to\nquantify backward transfer. Traditional task averages conflate these effects\nand obscure large changes. For multiple-choice benchmarks, we add\nchance-adjusted variants that subtract the expected contribution of random\nguessing from pre- and post-training accuracies. We apply this framework across\npost-training stages, model sizes, and data scales. Our large-scale analysis\nshows that: (1) Domain-continual pretraining induces moderate forgetting with\nlow-to-moderate backward transfer; (2) RL/SFT post-training applied to base\nmodels and Instruction tuning yields moderate-to-large backward transfer on\nmath and logic with overall low-to-moderate forgetting; (3) Applying RL/SFT to\ninstruction-tuned models is sensitive on data scale: at small scales, both\nforgetting and backward transfer are small; at larger scales, effects are mixed\nand warrant further study with better controls; (4) Model merging does not\nreliably mitigate forgetting.

We\npresent UltraCUA, a foundation model that bridges this gap through hybrid\naction -- seamlessly integrating GUI primitives with high-level programmatic\ntool calls. To achieve this, our approach comprises four key components: (1) an\nautomated pipeline that scales programmatic tools from software documentation,\nopen-source repositories, and code generation; (2) a synthetic data engine\nproducing over 17,000 verifiable tasks spanning real-world computer-use\nscenarios; (3) a large-scale high-quality hybrid action trajectory collection\nwith both low-level GUI actions and high-level programmatic tool calls; and (4)\na two-stage training pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning with online\nreinforcement learning, enabling strategic alternation between low-level and\nhigh-level actions.

This approach substantially compresses textual\ninput while preserving semantic information, and we further design an\nLLM-driven genetic search to identify optimal visual rendering configurations\nfor balancing accuracy and compression. Through extensive experiments, we\ndemonstrate that our method achieves 3-4x token compression while maintaining\naccuracy comparable to leading LLMs such as Qwen3-8B on various long-context\nbenchmarks. This compression also leads to around 4x faster prefilling and\ndecoding, and approximately 2x faster SFT training. Furthermore, under extreme\ncompression, a 128K-context VLM could scale to handle 1M-token-level text\ntasks. In addition, the rendered text data benefits real-world multimodal\ntasks, such as document understanding. Our code and model are released at\nhttps://github.com/thu-coai/Glyph."}
