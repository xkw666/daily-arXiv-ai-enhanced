Missing values in\ndata are a frequent challenge in most data generating domains and may cause a\nrange of analysis issues. Structural missingness in data may indicate issues in\ndata collection and pre-processing, but may also highlight important data\ncharacteristics. While research into statistical methods for dealing with\nmissing data are mainly focusing on replacing missing values with plausible\nestimated values, visualization has great potential to support a more in-depth\nunderstanding of missingness structures in data. Nonetheless, while the\ninterest in missing data visualization has increased in the last decade, it is\nstill a relatively overlooked research topic with a comparably small number of\npublications, few of which address scalability issues. Efficient visual\nanalysis approaches are needed to enable exploration of missingness structures\nin large and high-dimensional data, and to support informed decision-making in\ncontext of potential data quality issues.

Traditional approaches typically address\nthis by decomposing claims into sub-claims and querying a knowledge base to\nresolve hidden or ambiguous entities. However, the absence of effective\ndisambiguation strategies for these entities can compromise the entire\nverification process. To address these challenges, we propose\nVerify-in-the-Graph (VeGraph), a novel framework leveraging the reasoning and\ncomprehension abilities of LLM agents. VeGraph operates in three phases: (1)\nGraph Representation - an input claim is decomposed into structured triplets,\nforming a graph-based representation that integrates both structured and\nunstructured information; (2) Entity Disambiguation -VeGraph iteratively\ninteracts with the knowledge base to resolve ambiguous entities within the\ngraph for deeper sub-claim verification; and (3) Verification - remaining\ntriplets are verified to complete the fact-checking process. Experiments using\nMeta-Llama-3-70B (instruct version) show that VeGraph achieves competitive\nperformance compared to baselines on two benchmarks HoVer and FEVEROUS,\neffectively addressing claim verification challenges.

Approaches in scientific papers are extracted based on\napproach patterns. Additionally, five dimensions for categorizing approaches\nare identified using these patterns.

As\nthese LRMs are mostly developed by post-training on formal reasoning tasks,\nwhether they generalize the reasoning capability to help reduce hallucination\nin fact-seeking tasks remains unclear and debated. For instance, DeepSeek-R1\nreports increased performance on SimpleQA, a fact-seeking benchmark, while\nOpenAI-o3 observes even severer hallucination. This discrepancy naturally\nraises the following research question: Are reasoning models more prone to\nhallucination? This paper addresses the question from three perspectives. (1)\nWe first conduct a holistic evaluation for the hallucination in LRMs. Our\nanalysis reveals that LRMs undergo a full post-training pipeline with cold\nstart supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and verifiable reward RL generally alleviate\ntheir hallucination. In contrast, both distillation alone and RL training\nwithout cold start fine-tuning introduce more nuanced hallucinations. (2) To\nexplore why different post-training pipelines alters the impact on\nhallucination in LRMs, we conduct behavior analysis. We characterize two\ncritical cognitive behaviors that directly affect the factuality of a LRM: Flaw\nRepetition, where the surface-level reasoning attempts repeatedly follow the\nsame underlying flawed logic, and Think-Answer Mismatch, where the final answer\nfails to faithfully match the previous CoT process. (3) Further, we investigate\nthe mechanism behind the hallucination of LRMs from the perspective of model\nuncertainty.
