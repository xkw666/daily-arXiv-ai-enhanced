Although a few existing works\naddress this problem by leveraging physical simulation, they suffer from\nlimited accuracy or robustness to novel animation inputs. In this work, we\npresent MPMAvatar, a framework for creating 3D human avatars from multi-view\nvideos that supports highly realistic, robust animation, as well as\nphotorealistic rendering from free viewpoints. For accurate and robust dynamics\nmodeling, our key idea is to use a Material Point Method-based simulator, which\nwe carefully tailor to model garments with complex deformations and contact\nwith the underlying body by incorporating an anisotropic constitutive model and\na novel collision handling algorithm. We combine this dynamics modeling scheme\nwith our canonical avatar that can be rendered using 3D Gaussian Splatting with\nquasi-shadowing, enabling high-fidelity rendering for physically realistic\nanimations. In our experiments, we demonstrate that MPMAvatar significantly\noutperforms the existing state-of-the-art physics-based avatar in terms of (1)\ndynamics modeling accuracy, (2) rendering accuracy, and (3) robustness and\nefficiency. Additionally, we present a novel application in which our avatar\ngeneralizes to unseen interactions in a zero-shot manner-which was not\nachievable with previous learning-based methods due to their limited simulation\ngeneralizability.

Recent work on OST-AR depth\nperception shows that target opacity and tool visualization significantly\naffect accuracy and usability; opaque targets and rendering the real instrument\nreduce depth errors, whereas transparent targets and absent tools impair\nperformance. However, reliance on visual overlays may overload attention and\nleaves little room for depth cues when occlusion or lighting hampers\nperception. To address these limitations, we explore multimodal feedback that\ncombines OST-AR with wrist-based vibrotactile haptics. The past two years have\nseen rapid advances in haptic technology. Researchers have investigated\nskin-stretch and vibrotactile cues for conveying spatial information to blind\nusers, wearable ring actuators that support precise pinching in AR, cross-modal\naudio-haptic cursors that enable eyes-free object selection, and wrist-worn\nfeedback for teleoperated surgery that improves force awareness at the cost of\nlonger task times. Studies comparing pull versus push vibrotactile metaphors\nfound that pull cues yield faster gesture completion and lower cognitive load.\nThese findings motivate revisiting OST-AR guidance with a fresh perspective on\nwrist-based haptics. We design a custom wristband with six vibromotors\ndelivering directional and state cues, integrate it with a handheld tool and\nOST-AR, and assess its impact on cue recognition and depth guidance. Through a\nformative study and two experiments (N=21 and N=27), we show that participants\naccurately identify haptic patterns under cognitive load and that multimodal\nfeedback improves spatial precision and usability compared with visual-only or\nhaptic-only conditions."}

In large language models,\nsemantic cues such as the name of the day often remain stable across sessions,\nwhile episodic details like the sequential progression of experiment numbers\ntend to collapse when conversational context is reset. To capture this\nphenomenon, the Artificial Age Score (AAS) is introduced as a log-scaled,\nentropy-informed metric of memory aging derived from observable recall\nbehavior.

In its Redundancy-as-Masking formulation, the\nscore interprets redundancy as overlapping information that reduces the\npenalized mass. However, in the present study, redundancy is not explicitly\nestimated; all reported values assume a redundancy-neutral setting (R = 0),\nyielding conservative upper bounds. The AAS framework was tested over a 25-day\nbilingual study involving ChatGPT-5, structured into stateless and persistent\ninteraction phases.

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a popular\nframework for question answering that is powered by two large language models\n(LLMs): an embedding model that retrieves context documents from a database\nthat are relevant to a given question, and a generator model that uses the\nretrieved context to generate an answer to the question. Both the embedding and\ngenerator models can be fine-tuned to increase performance of a RAG pipeline on\na new task, but multiple fine-tuning strategies exist with different costs and\nbenefits. In this paper, we evaluate and compare several RAG fine-tuning\nstrategies, including independent, joint, and two-phase fine-tuning. In our\nexperiments, we observe that all of these strategies achieve about equal\nimprovement in EM and F1 generation quality metrics, although they have\nsignificantly different computational costs. We conclude the optimal\nfine-tuning strategy to use depends on whether the training dataset includes\ncontext labels and whether a grid search over the learning rates for the\nembedding and generator models is required."}

To this end, we investigate whether a language model can predict\nindividual value interpretations by leveraging multi-dimensional subjective\nannotations as a proxy for their interpretive lens. That is, we evaluate\nwhether providing examples of how an individual annotates Sentiment, Emotion,\nArgument, and Topics (SEAT dimensions) helps a language model in predicting\ntheir value interpretations. Our experiment across different zero- and few-shot\nsettings demonstrates that providing all SEAT dimensions simultaneously yields\nsuperior performance compared to individual dimensions and a baseline where no\ninformation about the individual is provided. Furthermore, individual\nvariations across annotators highlight the importance of accounting for the\nincorporation of individual subjective annotators. To the best of our\nknowledge, this controlled setting, although small in size, is the first\nattempt to go beyond demographics and investigate the impact of annotation\nbehavior on value prediction, providing a solid foundation for future\nlarge-scale validation."}

We construct controlled\nsynthetic datasets with formal normalization (1NF-3NF) and real academic paper\ndatasets with practical schemes. Our results show that denormalized schemas\noffer high accuracy on simple retrieval queries, even with cost-effective\nmodels in zero-shot settings. In contrast, normalized schemas (2NF/3NF)\nintroduce challenges such as errors in base table selection and join type\nprediction; however, these issues are substantially mitigated by providing\nfew-shot examples.

The\nprevailing approach for modeling these rating dynamics is to view battles as\ntwo-player game matches, as in chess, and apply the Elo rating system and its\nderivatives. In this paper, we critically examine this paradigm. Specifically,\nwe question whether a draw genuinely means that the two models are equal and\nhence whether their ratings should be equalized. Instead, we conjecture that\ndraws are more indicative of query difficulty: if the query is too easy, then\nboth models are more likely to succeed equally. On three real-world arena\ndatasets, we show that ignoring rating updates for draws yields a 1-3% relative\nincrease in battle outcome prediction accuracy (which includes draws) for all\nfour rating systems studied.

Vector Quantization (VQ) shows great promise for\nlow-bit quantization (e.g., 2 to 4 bits), but existing work faces two key\nchallenges: unconstrained direction error and suboptimal bit allocation. In\nthis paper, we propose RSAVQ, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit\nquantization for LLMs. RSAVQ introduces two geometry-driven innovations that\neffectively mitigate above limitations: (1) Error Direction Sensitivity\nGuidance (EDSG), which leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)-induced\nRiemannian metric to project quantization errors onto low-sensitivity\ndirections in the parameter space.

In this paper, we present\nRLP, an information-driven reinforcement pretraining objective, that brings the\ncore spirit of reinforcement learning -- exploration -- to the last phase of\npretraining. The key idea is to treat chain-of-thought as an exploratory\naction, with rewards computed based on the information gain it provides for\npredicting future tokens. This training objective essentially encourages the\nmodel to think for itself before predicting what comes next, thus teaching an\nindependent thinking behavior earlier in the pretraining. More concretely, the\nreward signal measures the increase in log-likelihood of the next token when\nconditioning on both context and a sampled reasoning chain, compared to\nconditioning on context alone. This approach yields a verifier-free dense\nreward signal, allowing for efficient training for the full document stream\nduring pretraining.

To determine whether an LLM can effectively take on the role of a\npsychological counselor, the first step is to assess whether it meets the\nqualifications required for such a role, namely the ability to pass the U.S.\nNational Counselor Certification Exam (NCE). This is because, just as a human\ncounselor must pass a certification exam to practice, an LLM must demonstrate\nsufficient psychological knowledge to meet the standards required for such a\nrole. To address this, we introduce PsychoBench, a benchmark grounded in\nU.S.national counselor examinations, a licensure test for professional\ncounselors that requires about 70% accuracy to pass.

We present Constrained Adaptive Rejection Sampling (CARS), an\napproach that strictly improves the sample-efficiency of RS without\ndistributional distortion. CARS begins with unconstrained LM sampling and\nadaptively rules out constraint-violating continuations by recording them in a\ntrie and subtracting their probability mass from future draws. This adaptive\npruning ensures that prefixes proven invalid are never revisited, acceptance\nrates improve monotonically, and the resulting samples exactly follow the\nconstrained distribution. In experiments on a variety of domains -- e.g.,\nprogram fuzzing and molecular generation -- CARS consistently achieves higher\nefficiency -- measured in the number of LM forward passes per valid sample --\nwhile also producing stronger sample diversity than both GCD and methods that\napproximate the LM's distribution."}

In addition to measuring output accuracy, we perform fine-grained\nevaluation of the natural-language rules that models generate to explain their\nsolutions. This dual evaluation lets us assess whether models solve tasks using\nthe abstractions ConceptARC was designed to elicit, rather than relying on\nsurface-level patterns. Our results show that, while some models using\ntext-based representations match human output accuracy, the best models' rules\nare often based on surface-level ``shortcuts'' and capture intended\nabstractions far less often than humans. Thus their capabilities for general\nabstract reasoning may be overestimated by evaluations based on accuracy alone.\nIn the visual modality, AI models' output accuracy drops sharply, yet our\nrule-level analysis reveals that models might be underestimated, as they still\nexhibit a substantial share of rules that capture intended abstractions, but\nare often unable to correctly apply these rules. In short, our results show\nthat models still lag humans in abstract reasoning, and that using accuracy\nalone to evaluate abstract reasoning on ARC-like tasks may overestimate\nabstract-reasoning capabilities in textual modalities and underestimate it in\nvisual modalities. We believe that our evaluation framework offers a more\nfaithful picture of multimodal models' abstract reasoning abilities and a more\nprincipled way to track progress toward human-like, abstraction-centered\nintelligence."}

This paper investigates the shrinkage issue of RLVR by\nanalyzing its learning dynamics and reveals two critical phenomena that explain\nthis failure. First, we expose negative interference in RLVR, where learning to\nsolve certain training problems actively reduces the likelihood of correct\nsolutions for others, leading to the decline of Pass@$k$ performance, or the\nprobability of generating a correct solution within $k$ attempts. Second, we\nuncover the winner-take-all phenomenon: RLVR disproportionately reinforces\nproblems with high likelihood, correct solutions, under the base model, while\nsuppressing other initially low-likelihood ones. Through extensive theoretical\nand empirical analysis on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we show\nthat this effect arises from the inherent on-policy sampling in standard RL\nobjectives, causing the model to converge toward narrow solution strategies.\nBased on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective data curation\nalgorithm that focuses RLVR learning on low-likelihood problems, achieving\nnotable improvement in Pass@$k$ performance.

To address more effective reasoning, we\nintroduce reasoning abstractions: concise natural language descriptions of\nprocedural and factual knowledge that guide the model toward learning\nsuccessful reasoning. We train models to be capable of proposing multiple\nabstractions given a problem, followed by RL that incentivizes building a\nsolution while using the information provided by these abstractions. This\nresults in a two-player RL training paradigm, abbreviated as RLAD, that jointly\ntrains an abstraction generator and a solution generator. This setup\neffectively enables structured exploration, decouples learning signals of\nabstraction proposal and solution generation, and improves generalization to\nharder problems.
