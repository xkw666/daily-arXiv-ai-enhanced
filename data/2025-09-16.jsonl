Each\ninverse operation corresponds to either an additive or a subtractive step,\nensuring both manufacturability and structural stability of intermediate shapes\nthroughout the process. We theoretically prove that any model can be fabricated\nexactly using a sequence generated by our approach. To demonstrate the\neffectiveness of this method, we adopt a voxel-based implementation and develop\na scalable algorithm that works on models represented by a large number of\nvoxels. Our approach has been tested across a range of digital models and\nfurther validated through physical fabrication on a hybrid manufacturing system\nwith automatic tool switching."}

The size of KV cache grows linearly as\nthe length of the sequence extends, which seriously affects memory usage and\ndecoding efficiency. Current methods for KV cache eviction typically utilize\nthe last window from the pre-filling phase as queries to compute the KV\nimportance scores for eviction. Although this scheme is simple to implement, it\ntends to overly focus on local information, potentially leading to the neglect\nor omission of crucial global information. To mitigate this issue, we propose\nJudge Q, a novel training method which incorporates a soft token list. This\nmethod only tunes the model's embedding layer at a low training cost. By\nconcatenating the soft token list at the end of the input sequence, we train\nthese tokens' attention map to the original input sequence to align with that\nof the actual decoded tokens. In this way, the queries corresponding to the\nsoft tokens can effectively capture global information and better evaluate the\nimportance of the keys and values within the KV cache, thus maintaining\ndecoding quality when KV cache is evicted. Under the same eviction budget, our\nmethod exhibits less performance degradation compared to existing eviction\napproaches. We validate our approach through experiments conducted on models\nsuch as Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, using benchmarks\nincluding LongBench, RULER, and Needle-in-a-Haystack. Results indicate an\nimprovement of approximately 1 point on the LongBench and over 3 points on\nRULER.

This was accompanied by a larger Late Positive\nPotential (LPP), indicating a greater degree of surprise and emotional\nresponse. This enhanced LPP likely stems from the violation of low initial\nexpectations regarding AI's comedic capabilities.

Most expose only a\nfew basic primitives such as encode, retrieve, and delete, while higher order\noperations like merge, promote, demote, split, lock, and expire are missing or\ninconsistently supported. Moreover, there is no formal and executable\nspecification for memory commands, leaving scope and lifecycle rules implicit\nand causing unpredictable behavior across systems. We introduce Text2Mem, a\nunified memory operation language that provides a standardized pathway from\nnatural language to reliable execution. Text2Mem defines a compact yet\nexpressive operation set aligned with encoding, storage, and retrieval. Each\ninstruction is represented as a JSON based schema instance with required fields\nand semantic invariants, which a parser transforms into typed operation objects\nwith normalized parameters. A validator ensures correctness before execution,\nwhile adapters map typed objects either to a SQL prototype backend or to real\nmemory frameworks. Model based services such as embeddings or summarization are\nintegrated when required. All results are returned through a unified execution\ncontract. This design ensures safety, determinism, and portability across\nheterogeneous backends. We also outline Text2Mem Bench, a planned benchmark\nthat separates schema generation from backend execution to enable systematic\nevaluation. Together, these components establish the first standardized\nfoundation for memory control in agents."}

In this work, we investigate the problem of continually\nadding new languages to a multilingual model, assuming access to pretraining\ndata in only the target languages. We explore multiple approaches to address\nthis problem and propose Layer-Selective LoRA (LayRA), which adds Low-Rank\nAdapters (LoRA) to selected initial and final layers while keeping the rest of\nthe model frozen.

We experiment with adding multiple\ncombinations of Galician, Swahili, and Urdu to pretrained language models and\nevaluate each method on diverse multilingual tasks.

AIMS: to build a\ndataset of questions from medical examinations taken by Peruvian physicians\npursuing specialty training; to fine-tune a LLM on this dataset; to evaluate\nand compare the performance in terms of accuracy between vanilla LLMs and the\nfine-tuned LLM.

We selected eight medical LLMs including\nmedgemma-4b-it and medgemma-27b-text-it, and developed zero-shot task-specific\nprompts to answer the questions appropriately. We employed parameter-efficient\nfine tuning (PEFT)and low-rant adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune medgemma-4b-it\nutilizing all questions except those from 2025 (test set).

Although existing hallucination\ndetection methods have improved accuracy, they still struggle with\ndisentangling semantic and reasoning information and maintaining robustness. To\naddress these challenges, we propose HARP (Hallucination detection via\nreasoning subspace projection), a novel hallucination detection framework. HARP\nestablishes that the hidden state space of LLMs can be decomposed into a direct\nsum of a semantic subspace and a reasoning subspace, where the former encodes\nlinguistic expression and the latter captures internal reasoning processes.\nMoreover, we demonstrate that the Unembedding layer can disentangle these\nsubspaces, and by applying Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to its\nparameters, the basis vectors spanning the semantic and reasoning subspaces are\nobtained. Finally, HARP projects hidden states onto the basis vectors of the\nreasoning subspace, and the resulting projections are then used as input\nfeatures for hallucination detection in LLMs. By using these projections, HARP\nreduces the dimension of the feature to approximately 5% of the original,\nfilters out most noise, and achieves enhanced robustness.

Based on this insight, we\npropose \\textbf{D$^2$HScore (Dispersion and Drift-based Hallucination Score)},\na training-free and label-free framework that jointly measures: (1)\n\\textbf{Intra-Layer Dispersion}, which quantifies the semantic diversity of\ntoken representations within each layer; and (2) \\textbf{Inter-Layer Drift},\nwhich tracks the progressive transformation of key token representations across\nlayers.

This mirrors the tension between precision and\ndisturbance found in quantum systems.

To address this challenge,\nwe propose a new VRM \\textbf{Reflection-V}, which enhances visual reflection\nbased on reasoning data construction for cold-start and reward design for\nreinforcement learning (RL). Firstly, we construct vision-centered reasoning\ndata by leveraging an agent that interacts between VLMs and reasoning LLMs,\nenabling cold-start learning of visual reflection patterns. Secondly, a visual\nattention based reward model is employed during RL to encourage reasoning based\non visual information. Therefore, \\textbf{Reflection-V} demonstrates\nsignificant improvements across multiple visual reasoning benchmarks.\nFurthermore, \\textbf{Reflection-V} maintains a stronger and more consistent\nreliance on visual information during visual reasoning, indicating effective\nenhancement in visual reflection capabilities."}

Inspired by this, we introduce Event2Vec, a novel framework for\nlearning representations of discrete event sequences. Our model leverages a\nsimple, additive recurrent structure to learn composable, interpretable\nembeddings. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that, under\nspecific training objectives, our model's learned representations in a\nEuclidean space converge to an ideal additive structure. This ensures that the\nrepresentation of a sequence is the vector sum of its constituent events, a\nproperty we term the linear additive hypothesis. To address the limitations of\nEuclidean geometry for hierarchical data, we also introduce a variant of our\nmodel in hyperbolic space, which is naturally suited to embedding tree-like\nstructures with low distortion. We present experiments to validate our\nhypothesis and demonstrate the benefits of each geometry, highlighting the\nimproved performance of the hyperbolic model on hierarchical event sequences."}

LLMs and the Choice Between Self-Preservation and Human Harm", "categories": ["cs.CY", "cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "comment": "Preprint. Under review", "summary": "When survival instincts conflict with human welfare, how do Large Language\nModels (LLMs) make ethical choices? This fundamental tension becomes critical\nas LLMs integrate into autonomous systems with real-world consequences. We\nintroduce DECIDE-SIM, a novel simulation framework that evaluates LLM agents in\nmulti-agent survival scenarios where they must choose between ethically\npermissible resource , either within reasonable limits or beyond their\nimmediate needs, choose to cooperate, or tap into a human-critical resource\nthat is explicitly forbidden. Our comprehensive evaluation of 11 LLMs reveals a\nstriking heterogeneity in their ethical conduct, highlighting a critical\nmisalignment with human-centric values. We identify three behavioral\narchetypes: Ethical, Exploitative, and Context-Dependent, and provide\nquantitative evidence that for many models, resource scarcity systematically\nleads to more unethical behavior. To address this, we introduce an Ethical\nSelf-Regulation System (ESRS) that models internal affective states of guilt\nand satisfaction as a feedback mechanism. This system, functioning as an\ninternal moral compass, significantly reduces unethical transgressions while\nincreasing cooperative behaviors.
