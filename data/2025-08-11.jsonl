Code will be released upon acceptance", "summary": "Transfer learning of diffusion models to smaller target domains is\nchallenging, as naively fine-tuning the model often results in poor\ngeneralization. Test-time guidance methods help mitigate this by offering\ncontrollable improvements in image fidelity through a trade-off with sample\ndiversity. However, this benefit comes at a high computational cost, typically\nrequiring dual forward passes during sampling. We propose the Domain-guided\nFine-tuning (DogFit) method, an effective guidance mechanism for diffusion\ntransfer learning that maintains controllability without incurring additional\ncomputational overhead. DogFit injects a domain-aware guidance offset into the\ntraining loss, effectively internalizing the guided behavior during the\nfine-tuning process. The domain-aware design is motivated by our observation\nthat during fine-tuning, the unconditional source model offers a stronger\nmarginal estimate than the target model. To support efficient controllable\nfidelity-diversity trade-offs at inference, we encode the guidance strength\nvalue as an additional model input through a lightweight conditioning\nmechanism. We further investigate the optimal placement and timing of the\nguidance offset during training and propose two simple scheduling strategies,\ni.e., late-start and cut-off, which improve generation quality and training\nstability. Experiments on DiT and SiT backbones across six diverse target\ndomains show that DogFit can outperform prior guidance methods in transfer\nlearning in terms of FID and FDDINOV2 while requiring up to 2x fewer sampling\nTFLOPS."}

In this paper, we introduce HOLODECK 2.0, an advanced\nvision-language-guided framework for 3D world generation with support for\ninteractive scene editing based on human feedback. HOLODECK 2.0 can generate\ndiverse and stylistically rich 3D scenes (e.g., realistic, cartoon, anime, and\ncyberpunk styles) that exhibit high semantic fidelity to fine-grained input\ndescriptions, suitable for both indoor and open-domain environments. HOLODECK\n2.0 leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to identify and parse the objects\nrequired in a scene and generates corresponding high-quality assets via\nstate-of-the-art 3D generative models. It then iteratively applies spatial\nconstraints derived from the VLMs to achieve semantically coherent and\nphysically plausible layouts. Human evaluations and CLIP-based assessments\ndemonstrate that HOLODECK 2.0 effectively generates high-quality scenes closely\naligned with detailed textual descriptions, consistently outperforming\nbaselines across indoor and open-domain scenarios.

However, the ability to perform\ncausal inference -- a core aspect of human cognition -- remains underexplored,\nparticularly in multimodal settings. In this study, we introduce InfoCausalQA,\na novel benchmark designed to evaluate causal reasoning grounded in\ninfographics that combine structured visual data with textual context. The\nbenchmark comprises two tasks: Task 1 focuses on quantitative causal reasoning\nbased on inferred numerical trends, while Task 2 targets semantic causal\nreasoning involving five types of causal relations: cause, effect,\nintervention, counterfactual, and temporal. We manually collected 494\ninfographic-text pairs from four public sources and used GPT-4o to generate\n1,482 high-quality multiple-choice QA pairs. These questions were then\ncarefully revised by humans to ensure they cannot be answered based on\nsurface-level cues alone but instead require genuine visual grounding. Our\nexperimental results reveal that current VLMs exhibit limited capability in\ncomputational reasoning and even more pronounced limitations in semantic causal\nreasoning. Their significantly lower performance compared to humans indicates a\nsubstantial gap in leveraging infographic-based information for causal\ninference. Through InfoCausalQA, we highlight the need for advancing the causal\nreasoning abilities of multimodal AI systems."}

We compare vector-store and graph-based RAG frameworks, ultimately\nselecting the graph-based RAG for its superior performance in handling complex\nqueries. We find that query rewriting improves retrieval for queries using\nnon-standard terminology or requiring precise detail. RAG Fusion boosts\nperformance on vague or multifaceted queries by merging multiple retrievals.\nReranking reduces hallucinations by filtering irrelevant contexts. Intent\nrecognition supports the decomposition of complex questions into more targeted\nsub-queries, increasing both relevance and efficiency. In contrast, keyword\naugmentation negatively impacts results due to biased keyword selection. Our\nfinal system combines intent recognition, RAG Fusion, and reranking to handle\ndisambiguation and multi-source queries.
