The present study addresses this question from the perspective of\nlexical diversity. Specifically, the study investigates patterns of lexical\ndiversity in LLM-generated texts from four ChatGPT models (-3.5, -4, -o4 mini,\nand -4.5) in comparison with texts written by L1 and L2 English participants (n\n= 240) across four education levels. Six dimensions of lexical diversity were\nmeasured in each text: volume, abundance, variety-repetition, evenness,\ndisparity, and dispersion. Results from one-way MANOVAs, one-way ANOVAS, and\nSupport Vector Machines revealed that the LLM-generated texts differed\nsignificantly from human-written texts for each variable, with ChatGPT-o4 mini\nand -4.5 differing the most. Within these two groups, ChatGPT-4.5 demonstrated\nhigher levels of lexical diversity despite producing fewer tokens. The human\nwriters' lexical diversity did not differ across subgroups (i.e., education,\nlanguage status). Altogether, the results indicate that LLMs do not produce\nhuman-like texts in relation to lexical diversity, and the newer LLMs produce\nless human-like texts than older models.

However, recent methods still exhibit quality deterioration in style\nproperties, especially under occlusions caused by overlapping body parts,\nleading to contour flickering and stroke blurring. This occurs due to a\n`stylization pose gap' between training and inference in stylization networks\ndesigned to preserve drawing styles in drawing-based 3D animation systems. The\nstylization pose gap denotes that input target poses used to train the\nstylization network are always in occlusion-free poses, while target poses\nencountered in an inference include diverse occlusions under dynamic motions.\nTo this end, we propose Occlusion-robust Stylization Framework (OSF) for\ndrawing-based 3D animation. We found that while employing object's edge can be\neffective input prior for guiding stylization, it becomes notably inaccurate\nwhen occlusions occur at inference.

EdgeInfinite offers an efficient\nsolution by fine-tuning only a small subset of parameters, maintaining quality\nwhile reducing both computational and memory costs, including improved TTFT.\nHowever, its instruction-following ability is limited, and it lacks\nmobile-specific optimizations. To address these issues, we propose\nEdgeInfinite-Instruct, which introduces a Segmented Supervised Fine-Tuning\n(S-SFT) strategy tailored to long-sequence tasks such as summarization and\nquestion answering. We further optimized EdgeInfinite-Instruct for efficient\ndeployment on edge NPUs by employing fine-grained post-training quantization\n(PTQ) to reduce computational demands while maintaining accuracy, and by\nimplementing a fixed-shape computation graph that balances memory usage and\non-device efficiency through scenario-specific customization of input token and\ncache sizes. Experiments on long-context benchmarks and real-world mobile tasks\nshow that our approach improves domain-specific performance while maintaining\nefficiency on NPU-accelerated edge devices."}

However,\nexisting work predominantly assumes the effectiveness of the demonstrations\nprovided within ICL, while many research indicates that not all demonstrations\nare effective, failing to yielding any performance improvement during ICL.\nTherefore, in this paper, we investigate the reasons behind demonstration\nineffectiveness. Our analysis is based on gradient flow and linear\nself-attention models. By setting the gradient flow to zero, we deduce that a\ndemonstration becomes ineffective if its information has either been learned by\nthe model or is irrelevant to the user query. Furthermore, we demonstrate that\nin multi-layer models, the disparity in effectiveness among demonstrations is\namplified with layer increasing, causing the model to focus more on effective\nones. Considering that current demonstration selection methods primarily focus\non the relevance to the user query while overlooking the information that the\nmodel has already assimilated, we propose a novel method called GradS, which\nleverages gradient flow for demonstration selection. We use the magnitude of\nthe gradient flow of the demonstration with respect to a given user query as\nthe criterion, thereby ensuring the effectiveness of the chosen ones. We\nvalidate our derivation and GradS on four prominent LLMs across five mainstream\ndatasets. The experimental results confirm that the disparity in effectiveness\namong demonstrations is magnified as the model layer increases, substantiating\nour derivations.

MetaAgent starts with a minimal\nworkflow, equipped only with basic reasoning and adaptive help-seeking\nabilities. When a knowledge gap is encountered, MetaAgent generates natural\nlanguage help requests, which are routed to the most suitable external tool by\na dedicated tool router. As MetaAgent solves tasks, it continually conducts\nself-reflection and answer verification, distilling actionable experience into\nconcise texts that are dynamically incorporated into future task contexts.\nBesides, MetaAgent autonomously builds in-house tools and a persistent\nknowledge base by organizing its tool-use history, further enhancing its\nability to retrieve and integrate relevant information We term this continual,\ndata-driven process as \\textit{meta tool learning}, through which MetaAgent\nincrementally refines its reasoning and tool-use strategies, without changing\nmodel parameters or requiring further post-training. Evaluated on challenging\nknowledge discovery benchmarks, including GAIA, WebWalkerQA, and BrowseCamp,\nMetaAgent consistently outperforms workflow-based baselines and matches or\nexceeds end-to-end trained agents, demonstrating the promise of self-evolving\nagentic systems for robust, general-purpose knowledge discovery.

While generative agents powered by large language models (LLMs)\naim to simulate this complex behavior, it remains uncertain whether they\noperate on similar cognitive principles. To address this, we conducted a\ntask-generation experiment comparing human responses with those of an LLM agent\n(GPT-4o). We find that human task generation is consistently influenced by\npsychological drivers, including personal values (e.g., Openness to Change) and\ncognitive style. Even when these psychological drivers are explicitly provided\nto the LLM, it fails to reflect the corresponding behavioral patterns. They\nproduce tasks that are markedly less social, less physical, and thematically\nbiased toward abstraction. Interestingly, while the LLM's tasks were perceived\nas more fun and novel, this highlights a disconnect between its linguistic\nproficiency and its capacity to generate human-like, embodied goals.We conclude\nthat there is a core gap between the value-driven, embodied nature of human\ncognition and the statistical patterns of LLMs, highlighting the necessity of\nincorporating intrinsic motivation and physical grounding into the design of\nmore human-aligned agents."}

To effectively evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in this domain, it\nis crucial to have a well-designed benchmark that accurately reflects\nreal-world scenarios and mitigates common pitfalls. Existing LLM test\ngeneration benchmarks are limited by two critical drawbacks: data contamination\nand structurally simple function code. As a result, we often cannot rely on the\nvalidity of scientific conclusions drawn from empirical studies using these\nlimited benchmarks. The empirical evidence presented may be biased due to\ncontamination and may fail to generalize beyond toy programs due to structural\nsimplicity.\n  To address these problems, we introduce ULT (UnLeakedTestbench), a new\nbenchmark specifically designed for function-level unit test generation from\nreal-world Python functions. ULT is constructed through a multi-stage curation\nprocess that ensures high cyclomatic complexity and mitigates test case\ncontamination. With 3,909 carefully selected function-level tasks, ULT provides\na more realistic and challenging evaluation of LLMs' test generation\ncapabilities. We also provide PLT (PreLeakedTestbench), a pair benchmark of ULT\nwith leaked tests designed to enable a controlled analysis of memorization\nversus reasoning in test generation. Our evaluation results demonstrate that\nULT is significantly more challenging. For example, test cases generated by\nLLMs only achieve 41.32\\%, 45.10\\%, 30.22\\%, and 40.21\\% for accuracy,\nstatement coverage, branch coverage, and mutation score on average for all\nLLMs, respectively. These results are substantially lower than the\ncorresponding metrics on TestEval (91.79\\%, 92.18\\%, 82.04\\%, and 49.69\\%) and\nPLT (47.07\\%, 55.13\\%, 40.07\\%, and 50.80\\%)."}
