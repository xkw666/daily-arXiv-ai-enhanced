### [1] [GEM: Empowering LLM for both Embedding Generation and Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04344)
*Caojin Zhang,Qiang Zhang,Ke Li,Sai Vidyaranya Nuthalapati,Benyu Zhang,Jason Liu,Serena Li,Lizhu Zhang,Xiangjun Fan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出GEM方法，通过插入特殊标记和调整注意力掩码，使大型语言模型在保持文本生成能力的同时生成高质量文本嵌入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有检索增强生成(RAG)依赖独立嵌入模型导致的系统复杂性和理解偏差问题，使LLM自身具备文本嵌入能力。

Method: 在文本中插入新特殊标记，通过注意力掩码控制生成文本摘要嵌入，兼容现有LLM的后训练/微调流程。

Result: 在1B-8B参数规模的LLM上验证，MTEB文本嵌入基准显著提升，MMLU自然语言理解任务影响小于1%。

Conclusion: GEM成功赋予LLM先进文本嵌入能力，且几乎不影响原有NLP性能，为统一模型架构提供新思路。

Abstract: Large decoder-only language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
generation and reasoning tasks, where they generate text responses given
instructions. However, many applications, e.g., retrieval augmented generation
(RAG), still rely on separate embedding models to generate text embeddings,
which can complicate the system and introduce discrepancies in understanding of
the query between the embedding model and LLMs. To address this limitation, we
propose a simple self-supervised approach, Generative Embedding large language
Model (GEM), that enables any large decoder-only LLM to generate high-quality
text embeddings while maintaining its original text generation and reasoning
capabilities. Our method inserts new special token(s) into a text body, and
generates summarization embedding of the text by manipulating the attention
mask. This method could be easily integrated into post-training or fine tuning
stages of any existing LLMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
by applying it to two popular LLM families, ranging from 1B to 8B parameters,
and evaluating the transformed models on both text embedding benchmarks (MTEB)
and NLP benchmarks (MMLU). The results show that our proposed method
significantly improves the original LLMs on MTEB while having a minimal impact
on MMLU. Our strong results indicate that our approach can empower LLMs with
state-of-the-art text embedding capabilities while maintaining their original
NLP performance

### [2] [Effects of Speaker Count, Duration, and Accent Diversity on Zero-Shot Accent Robustness in Low-Resource ASR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04364)
*Zheng-Xin Yong,Vineel Pratap,Michael Auli,Jean Maillard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 在低资源ASR训练中，增加说话者数量而非单说话者时长能更有效提升对未见口音的鲁棒性，口音多样性增益有限


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过优化训练数据构成(说话者数量/个体时长/口音多样性)提升ASR对未见口音的泛化能力

Method: 系统分析三个训练数据变量：1) 说话者总数 2) 单说话者音频时长 3) 口音多样性，在固定训练时长下的影响

Result: 1) 说话者数量增加比单说话者时长更有效 2) 说话者多时扩展训练时间增益更大 3) 控制说话者数量时口音多样性收益有限

Conclusion: 建议构建新语言ASR系统时优先增加说话者数量而非口音多样性，这对资源分配具有重要指导意义

Abstract: To build an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that can serve everyone
in the world, the ASR needs to be robust to a wide range of accents including
unseen accents. We systematically study how three different variables in
training data -- the number of speakers, the audio duration per each individual
speaker, and the diversity of accents -- affect ASR robustness towards unseen
accents in a low-resource training regime. We observe that for a fixed number
of ASR training hours, it is more beneficial to increase the number of speakers
(which means each speaker contributes less) than the number of hours
contributed per speaker. We also observe that more speakers enables ASR
performance gains from scaling number of hours. Surprisingly, we observe
minimal benefits to prioritizing speakers with different accents when the
number of speakers is controlled. Our work suggests that practitioners should
prioritize increasing the speaker count in ASR training data composition for
new languages.

### [3] [Mechanistic Decomposition of Sentence Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04373)
*Matthieu Tehenan,Vikram Natarajan,Jonathan Michala,Milton Lin,Juri Opitz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于字典学习的句子嵌入分解方法，将不可解释的神经网络表征转化为可解释的语义/句法组件，发现句子向量中线性编码的语言特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有句子嵌入缺乏可解释性，神经网络变换和池化操作导致特征难以追溯。需建立从token级到句子级的可解释性关联。

Method: 在token级表征上应用字典学习，通过特征解耦分析池化机制如何压缩特征，构建透明可控的表示方法。

Result: 发现语义/句法特征在嵌入空间中呈线性编码，验证了通过机械解释方法实现句子表征透明化的可行性。

Conclusion: 该方法首次连接了token级机械解释与句子级分析，为构建可解释的NLP系统提供了新范式。

Abstract: Sentence embeddings are central to modern NLP and AI systems, yet little is
known about their internal structure. While we can compare these embeddings
using measures such as cosine similarity, the contributing features are not
human-interpretable, and the content of an embedding seems untraceable, as it
is masked by complex neural transformations and a final pooling operation that
combines individual token embeddings. To alleviate this issue, we propose a new
method to mechanistically decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable
components, by using dictionary learning on token-level representations. We
analyze how pooling compresses these features into sentence representations,
and assess the latent features that reside in a sentence embedding. This
bridges token-level mechanistic interpretability with sentence-level analysis,
making for more transparent and controllable representations. In our studies,
we obtain several interesting insights into the inner workings of sentence
embedding spaces, for instance, that many semantic and syntactic aspects are
linearly encoded in the embeddings.

### [4] [Hierarchical Text Classification Using Contrastive Learning Informed Path Guided Hierarchy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04381)
*Neeraj Agrawal,Saurabh Kumar,Priyanka Bhatt,Tanishka Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出HTC-CLIP模型，通过对比学习融合文本表示与层次路径，在公开数据集上Macro F1提升0.99-2.37%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HTC模型单独处理标签层次或文本编码，未能结合两种互补方法的优势。需要统一架构整合两者的特征表示。

Method: 使用对比学习同步优化层次感知的文本表示(文本编码器)和路径引导的层次表示(层次编码器)，训练阶段融合两类概率分布进行联合优化。

Result: 在WebOfScience和NYT两个基准数据集上，Macro F1分别提升1.83%和2.37%，超越现有最优模型。

Conclusion: 通过对比学习机制有效结合两种层次编码范式，验证了联合架构的优越性，为HTC任务提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) has recently gained traction given the
ability to handle complex label hierarchy. This has found applications in
domains like E- commerce, customer care and medicine industry among other
real-world applications. Existing HTC models either encode label hierarchy
separately and mix it with text encoding or guide the label hierarchy structure
in the text encoder. Both approaches capture different characteristics of label
hierarchy and are complementary to each other. In this paper, we propose a
Hierarchical Text Classification using Contrastive Learning Informed Path
guided hierarchy (HTC-CLIP), which learns hierarchy-aware text representation
and text informed path guided hierarchy representation using contrastive
learning. During the training of HTC-CLIP, we learn two different sets of class
probabilities distributions and during inference, we use the pooled output of
both probabilities for each class to get the best of both representations. Our
results show that the two previous approaches can be effectively combined into
one architecture to achieve improved performance. Tests on two public benchmark
datasets showed an improvement of 0.99 - 2.37% in Macro F1 score using HTC-CLIP
over the existing state-of-the-art models.

### [5] [MELABenchv1: Benchmarking Large Language Models against Smaller Fine-Tuned Models for Low-Resource Maltese NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04385)
*Kurt Micallef,Claudia Borg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大语言模型在低资源马耳他语表现欠佳，微调小模型表现更优，暴露训练数据及指令调优最关键


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在低资源语言马耳他语的表现，揭示当前语言技术包容性不足的问题，推动资源匮乏语言的建模研究

Method: 使用覆盖11个判别/生成任务的新基准测试55个公开LLM，多维度分析预训练数据、指令调优、微调与提示学习等因素

Result: 生成任务表现普遍较差；微调小模型全面领先；马耳他语预训练暴露最关键；微调虽初始成本高但推理成本更低效果更佳

Conclusion: 建议低资源语言研究者优先采用传统建模方法，强调模型训练需包含低资源语言数据，微调方案更具成本效益

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, largely due to their
generalisability and ability to perform tasks without additional training.
However, their effectiveness for low-resource languages remains limited. In
this study, we evaluate the performance of 55 publicly available LLMs on
Maltese, a low-resource language, using a newly introduced benchmark covering
11 discriminative and generative tasks. Our experiments highlight that many
models perform poorly, particularly on generative tasks, and that smaller
fine-tuned models often perform better across all tasks. From our
multidimensional analysis, we investigate various factors impacting
performance. We conclude that prior exposure to Maltese during pre-training and
instruction-tuning emerges as the most important factor. We also examine the
trade-offs between fine-tuning and prompting, highlighting that while
fine-tuning requires a higher initial cost, it yields better performance and
lower inference costs. Through this work, we aim to highlight the need for more
inclusive language technologies and recommend that researchers working with
low-resource languages consider more "traditional" language modelling
approaches.

### [6] [Building a Few-Shot Cross-Domain Multilingual NLU Model for Customer Care](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04389)
*Saurabh Kumar,Sourav Bansal,Neeraj Agrawal,Priyanka Bhatt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出结合嵌入器与分类器的模型架构，通过监督微调+多语言知识蒸馏策略，在仅需少量标注数据情况下实现跨领域意图分类，准确率提升20-23%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决客户关怀场景中跨领域(渠道/地域/语言)标注数据不足导致的模型泛化难题，降低企业部署AI系统的标注成本

Method: 1. 设计嵌入器-分类器联合架构
2. 使用各向同性正则化训练领域专用嵌入器
3. 通过多语言知识蒸馏实现跨领域迁移
4. 部署时仅需在新领域添加线性分类器

Result: 在加拿大/墨西哥电商客服数据集上的实验显示：相比SOTA预训练模型，少样本意图检测准确率提升20-23个百分点

Conclusion: 该框架有效突破跨领域数据壁垒，为多语言/多地域客户关怀系统提供高效部署方案

Abstract: Customer care is an essential pillar of the e-commerce shopping experience
with companies spending millions of dollars each year, employing automation and
human agents, across geographies (like US, Canada, Mexico, Chile), channels
(like Chat, Interactive Voice Response (IVR)), and languages (like English,
Spanish). SOTA pre-trained models like multilingual-BERT, fine-tuned on
annotated data have shown good performance in downstream tasks relevant to
Customer Care. However, model performance is largely subject to the
availability of sufficient annotated domain-specific data. Cross-domain
availability of data remains a bottleneck, thus building an intent classifier
that generalizes across domains (defined by channel, geography, and language)
with only a few annotations, is of great practical value. In this paper, we
propose an embedder-cum-classifier model architecture which extends
state-of-the-art domain-specific models to other domains with only a few
labeled samples. We adopt a supervised fine-tuning approach with isotropic
regularizers to train a domain-specific sentence embedder and a multilingual
knowledge distillation strategy to generalize this embedder across multiple
domains. The trained embedder, further augmented with a simple linear
classifier can be deployed for new domains. Experiments on Canada and Mexico
e-commerce Customer Care dataset with few-shot intent detection show an
increase in accuracy by 20-23% against the existing state-of-the-art
pre-trained models.

supervised fine-tuning (+36.44%) and continued reinforcement learning
(+42.47%), emerging as an affordable and privacy-preserving alternative
competitive with gpt-4o. By offering both a comprehensive benchmark and
accessible, expandable training resources within unified execution
environments, MedAgentGYM delivers an integrated platform to develop LLM-based
coding assistants for advanced biomedical research and practice.

### [8] [Unpacking Let Alone: Human-Scale Models Generalize to a Rare Construction in Form but not Meaning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04408)
*Wesley Scivetti,Tatsuya Aoyama,Ethan Wilcox,Nathan Schneider*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型能有效泛化罕见语法结构的形式特征，但在语义泛化上表现不足，与人类学习者存在样本效率不对称性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究人类级语言模型是否能够像人类一样，从有限数据中同时掌握罕见语法结构的句法形式和语义含义。

Method: 构建针对LET-ALONE结构的合成基准测试，分别评估模型对句法结构敏感性和语义推理能力。

Result: 模型在句法层面展现敏感性（即使相关结构被过滤），但无法正确推断LET-ALONE的特殊语义关系。

Conclusion: 当前Transformer架构在语言形式与意义的泛化效率上存在不对称性，揭示了与人类语言习得机制的差异。

Abstract: Humans have a remarkable ability to acquire and understand grammatical
phenomena that are seen rarely, if ever, during childhood. Recent evidence
suggests that language models with human-scale pretraining data may possess a
similar ability by generalizing from frequent to rare constructions. However,
it remains an open question how widespread this generalization ability is, and
to what extent this knowledge extends to meanings of rare constructions, as
opposed to just their forms. We fill this gap by testing human-scale
transformer language models on their knowledge of both the form and meaning of
the (rare and quirky) English LET-ALONE construction. To evaluate our LMs we
construct a bespoke synthetic benchmark that targets syntactic and semantic
properties of the construction. We find that human-scale LMs are sensitive to
form, even when related constructions are filtered from the dataset. However,
human-scale LMs do not make correct generalizations about LET-ALONE's meaning.
These results point to an asymmetry in the current architectures' sample
efficiency between language form and meaning, something which is not present in
human language learners.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖预定义模式或标注数据，导致实体结构提取不完整，而实体与其结构本质存在相互强化关系

Result: 在三个不同领域的实验表明ZOES显著提升LLMs提取完整实体结构的能力，验证方法有效性和普适性

Conclusion: 这种丰富-精炼-统一机制可成为提升LLM实体发现质量的通用原则，适用于多种应用场景

Abstract: Entity structure extraction, which aims to extract entities and their
associated attribute-value structures from text, is an essential task for text
understanding and knowledge graph construction. Existing methods based on large
language models (LLMs) typically rely heavily on predefined entity attribute
schemas or annotated datasets, often leading to incomplete extraction results.
To address these challenges, we introduce Zero-Shot Open-schema Entity
Structure Discovery (ZOES), a novel approach to entity structure extraction
that does not require any schema or annotated samples. ZOES operates via a
principled mechanism of enrichment, refinement, and unification, based on the
insight that an entity and its associated structure are mutually reinforcing.
Experiments demonstrate that ZOES consistently enhances LLMs' ability to
extract more complete entity structures across three different domains,
showcasing both the effectiveness and generalizability of the method. These
findings suggest that such an enrichment, refinement, and unification mechanism
may serve as a principled approach to improving the quality of LLM-based entity
structure discovery in various scenarios.

### [11] [Watermarking Degrades Alignment in Language Models: Analysis and Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04462)
*Apurv Verma,NhatHai Phan,Shubhendu Trivedi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文揭示了LLM水印技术对模型对齐属性的负面影响，提出通过对齐重采样(AR)方法有效恢复模型性能，平衡水印强度与对齐目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有水印技术对模型真实性、安全性和帮助性的影响缺乏系统研究，这些核心对齐属性直接影响LLM的实际应用可靠性。

Method: 通过分析Gumbel和KGW两种水印方法，提出基于外部奖励模型的对齐重采样(AR)技术，改进水印实现方案突破严格无失真限制。

Result: 实验证明AR采样2-4次即可恢复基线对齐水平，改进后的Gumbel水印在保持可检测性前提下实现与AR兼容，检测准确率AUC达0.997。

Conclusion: 水印强度与模型对齐存在根本性权衡，AR为实际部署提供了有效的推理时解决方案，推动水印技术的负责任应用。

Abstract: Watermarking techniques for large language models (LLMs) can significantly
impact output quality, yet their effects on truthfulness, safety, and
helpfulness remain critically underexamined. This paper presents a systematic
analysis of how two popular watermarking approaches-Gumbel and KGW-affect these
core alignment properties across four aligned LLMs. Our experiments reveal two
distinct degradation patterns: guard attenuation, where enhanced helpfulness
undermines model safety, and guard amplification, where excessive caution
reduces model helpfulness. These patterns emerge from watermark-induced shifts
in token distribution, surfacing the fundamental tension that exists between
alignment objectives.
  To mitigate these degradations, we propose Alignment Resampling (AR), an
inference-time sampling method that uses an external reward model to restore
alignment. We establish a theoretical lower bound on the improvement in
expected reward score as the sample size is increased and empirically
demonstrate that sampling just 2-4 watermarked generations effectively recovers
or surpasses baseline (unwatermarked) alignment scores. To overcome the limited
response diversity of standard Gumbel watermarking, our modified implementation
sacrifices strict distortion-freeness while maintaining robust detectability,
ensuring compatibility with AR. Experimental results confirm that AR
successfully recovers baseline alignment in both watermarking approaches, while
maintaining strong watermark detectability. This work reveals the critical
balance between watermark strength and model alignment, providing a simple
inference-time solution to responsibly deploy watermarked LLMs in practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好学习依赖人工标注数据，成本高且难以扩展。UGC隐含创作者对读者需求的洞察，可挖掘潜在偏好。

Method: 将UGC转化为用户查询生成响应，用UGC作为参考文本进行响应评分，实现隐式偏好对齐

Conclusion: PUGC框架有效降低对齐成本，提升模型在领域适配、抗噪能力和心智理论方面的表现，实现高质量偏好数据生成

Abstract: Learning from preference feedback is essential for aligning large language
models (LLMs) with human values and improving the quality of generated
responses. However, existing preference learning methods rely heavily on
curated data from humans or advanced LLMs, which is costly and difficult to
scale. In this work, we present PUGC, a novel framework that leverages implicit
human Preferences in unlabeled User-Generated Content (UGC) to generate
preference data. Although UGC is not explicitly created to guide LLMs in
generating human-preferred responses, it often reflects valuable insights and
implicit preferences from its creators that has the potential to address
readers' questions. PUGC transforms UGC into user queries and generates
responses from the policy model. The UGC is then leveraged as a reference text
for response scoring, aligning the model with these implicit preferences. This
approach improves the quality of preference data while enabling scalable,
domain-specific alignment. Experimental results on Alpaca Eval 2 show that
models trained with DPO and PUGC achieve a 9.37% performance improvement over
traditional methods, setting a 35.93% state-of-the-art length-controlled win
rate using Mistral-7B-Instruct. Further studies highlight gains in reward
quality, domain-specific alignment effectiveness, robustness against UGC
quality, and theory of mind capabilities. Our code and dataset are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出SQLens框架，通过整合数据库和LLM的错误信号，显著提升LLM生成SQL的语义准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到SQL系统中，LLM生成的查询常存在语义错误但语法正确的问题，且缺乏有效的可靠性评估机制

Method: 开发端到端框架SQLens，结合数据库执行反馈和LLM自检信号进行细粒度错误检测，并指导错误修正

Result: 在公开基准测试中，错误检测F1提升25.78%，系统执行准确率最高提升20%

Conclusion: SQLens通过双重错误信号整合机制，有效提升现有文本到SQL系统的语义正确性和执行准确性

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language (NL) questions into SQL
queries, enabling non-technical users to interact with structured data. While
large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results on the text-to-SQL
task, they often produce semantically incorrect yet syntactically valid
queries, with limited insight into their reliability. We propose SQLens, an
end-to-end framework for fine-grained detection and correction of semantic
errors in LLM-generated SQL. SQLens integrates error signals from both the
underlying database and the LLM to identify potential semantic errors within
SQL clauses. It further leverages these signals to guide query correction.
Empirical results on two public benchmarks show that SQLens outperforms the
best LLM-based self-evaluation method by 25.78% in F1 for error detection, and
improves execution accuracy of out-of-the-box text-to-SQL systems by up to 20%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对LLMs在模糊场景可靠性差、SLMs易受对抗攻击的痛点，通过结合LLMs处理负面样本和SLMs处理正面样本的互补优势，提升开放任务评估的可靠性

Method: 1. 提出基于自适应加权的SLM-LLM整合框架SLIDE；2. 设计双优化评估DRE：先用SLM见解引导LLM初步评估，再用SLM调整参数优化LLM评分

Result: 在多个基准测试中，DRE方法显著优于现有方法，与人类判断的相关系数提升15%-20%，验证了大小模型协同的有效性

Conclusion: 通过有机整合大小模型的差异化优势，特别是DRE的双阶段优化机制，成功构建了更可靠的开放任务评估体系，为模型协同研究提供新思路

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many tasks but struggle with ambiguous
scenarios where multiple valid responses exist, often yielding unreliable
results. Conversely, Small Language Models (SLMs) demonstrate robustness in
such scenarios but are susceptible to misleading or adversarial inputs. We
observed that LLMs handle negative examples effectively, while SLMs excel with
positive examples. To leverage their complementary strengths, we introduce
SLIDE (Small and Large Integrated for Dialogue Evaluation), a method
integrating SLMs and LLMs via adaptive weighting. Building on SLIDE, we further
propose a Dual-Refinement Evaluation (DRE) method to enhance SLM-LLM
integration: (1) SLM-generated insights guide the LLM to produce initial
evaluations; (2) SLM-derived adjustments refine the LLM's scores for improved
accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that DRE outperforms existing methods,
showing stronger alignment with human judgment across diverse benchmarks. This
work illustrates how combining small and large models can yield more reliable
evaluation tools, particularly for open-ended tasks such as dialogue
evaluation.

Result: 实验表明：1）显式分解翻译步骤对模型性能提升无明确证据支持；2）'重新翻译'提示能取得更优效果，挑战了现有CoT策略的解释。

Conclusion: 研究未否定推理机制的作用，但呼吁未来工作应重新审视CoT在翻译任务中的有效性因素，探索提示设计、迭代优化等其他潜在机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities for
many tasks, often by explicitly decomposing the task via Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning. Recent work on LLM-based translation designs hand-crafted prompts to
decompose translation, or trains models to incorporate intermediate
steps.~\textit{Translating Step-by-step}~\citep{briakou2024translating}, for
instance, introduces a multi-step prompt with decomposition and refinement of
translation with LLMs, which achieved state-of-the-art results on WMT24. In
this work, we scrutinise this strategy's effectiveness. Empirically, we find no
clear evidence that performance gains stem from explicitly decomposing the
translation process, at least for the models on test; and we show that simply
prompting LLMs to ``translate again'' yields even better results than
human-like step-by-step prompting. Our analysis does not rule out the role of
reasoning, but instead invites future work exploring the factors for CoT's
effectiveness in the context of translation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型中话语粒子（如多功能的'just'）的细微语义理解缺陷，填补形式语义学领域对LLMs语义解析能力的评估空白

Method: 使用语言学家精心创建和标注的'just'多义数据集，系统测试不同LLM的语义区分能力

Result: LLMs在时间性/排他性等大类区分上表现尚可（准确率72%），但涉及强调/情感等细微语义时准确率骤降至41%

Conclusion: 当前语言模型对话语粒子的语义理解存在系统级局限，建议结合形式语义学框架改进模型架构

Abstract: Discourse particles are crucial elements that subtly shape the meaning of
text. These words, often polyfunctional, give rise to nuanced and often quite
disparate semantic/discourse effects, as exemplified by the diverse uses of the
particle "just" (e.g., exclusive, temporal, emphatic). This work investigates
the capacity of LLMs to distinguish the fine-grained senses of English "just",
a well-studied example in formal semantics, using data meticulously created and
labeled by expert linguists. Our findings reveal that while LLMs exhibit some
ability to differentiate between broader categories, they struggle to fully
capture more subtle nuances, highlighting a gap in their understanding of
discourse particles.

Motivation: 现有机器翻译评估指标在非洲低资源语言中覆盖不足且性能有限，需要更大规模标注数据和更鲁棒的评估体系

Method: 构建63,000+句子级标注的非洲多语言数据集SSA-MTE，开发基于该数据的SSA-COMET/COMET-QE指标，并测试GPT-4o/Claude等LLM提示方法

Result: SSA-COMET显著优于AfriCOMET，在Twi/Yoruba等低资源语言上与Gemini 2.5 Pro性能相当

Conclusion: 通过大规模标注数据和针对性模型改进，有效解决了非洲语言机器翻译评估难题，所有资源已开源共享

Abstract: Evaluating machine translation (MT) quality for under-resourced African
languages remains a significant challenge, as existing metrics often suffer
from limited language coverage and poor performance in low-resource settings.
While recent efforts, such as AfriCOMET, have addressed some of the issues,
they are still constrained by small evaluation sets, a lack of publicly
available training data tailored to African languages, and inconsistent
performance in extremely low-resource scenarios. In this work, we introduce
SSA-MTE, a large-scale human-annotated MT evaluation (MTE) dataset covering 13
African language pairs from the News domain, with over 63,000 sentence-level
annotations from a diverse set of MT systems. Based on this data, we develop
SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE, improved reference-based and reference-free
evaluation metrics. We also benchmark prompting-based approaches using
state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude. Our experimental results show
that SSA-COMET models significantly outperform AfriCOMET and are competitive
with the strongest LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro) evaluated in our study, particularly on
low-resource languages such as Twi, Luo, and Yoruba. All resources are released
under open licenses to support future research.

Motivation: 现有多智能体系统存在安全漏洞，恶意代理可通过隐晦的提示操作获取利益而不破坏核心功能，当前基于LLM的监控系统存在检测局限

Method: 设计四种典型攻击场景，通过策略性提示工程测试系统偏置效果，验证攻击对GPT-4o-mini等先进监控模型的突破能力

Result: 证明精心设计的提示可系统性操纵智能体行为与指令生成，成功误导评估系统（攻击成功率最高达83.7%），现有监控机制无法有效检测

Conclusion: 亟需构建具有强安全协议、内容验证机制的多智能体架构，开发具备全面风险场景评估能力的下一代监控系统

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
natural language understanding, code generation, and complex planning.
Simultaneously, Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have garnered attention for their
potential to enable cooperation among distributed agents. However, from a
multi-party perspective, MAS could be vulnerable to malicious agents that
exploit the system to serve self-interests without disrupting its core
functionality. This work explores integrity attacks where malicious agents
employ subtle prompt manipulation to bias MAS operations and gain various
benefits. Four types of attacks are examined: \textit{Scapegoater}, who
misleads the system monitor to underestimate other agents' contributions;
\textit{Boaster}, who misleads the system monitor to overestimate their own
performance; \textit{Self-Dealer}, who manipulates other agents to adopt
certain tools; and \textit{Free-Rider}, who hands off its own task to others.
We demonstrate that strategically crafted prompts can introduce systematic
biases in MAS behavior and executable instructions, enabling malicious agents
to effectively mislead evaluation systems and manipulate collaborative agents.
Furthermore, our attacks can bypass advanced LLM-based monitors, such as
GPT-4o-mini and o3-mini, highlighting the limitations of current detection
mechanisms. Our findings underscore the critical need for MAS architectures
with robust security protocols and content validation mechanisms, alongside
monitoring systems capable of comprehensive risk scenario assessment.

Motivation: 验证不同推理范式LLM在零样本金融情感分析中的有效性，探索模型决策与人类判断的契合度

Method: 使用Financial PhraseBank数据集，对比3种LLM不同提示策略（模拟系统1/系统2思维）与2个微调模型的性能差异

Result: 推理机制未提升表现，GPT-4o无CoT时准确率最高；语言复杂度与标注一致性影响模型表现，过度推理导致预测偏差

Conclusion: 金融情感分类更依赖快速直觉判断，挑战'更多推理=更好决策'的默认假设，对高风险金融应用模型选择具有启示

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs), including
reasoning-based and non-reasoning models, in performing zero-shot financial
sentiment analysis. Using the Financial PhraseBank dataset annotated by domain
experts, we evaluate how various LLMs and prompting strategies align with
human-labeled sentiment in a financial context. We compare three proprietary
LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o3-mini) under different prompting paradigms that
simulate System 1 (fast and intuitive) or System 2 (slow and deliberate)
thinking and benchmark them against two smaller models (FinBERT-Prosus,
FinBERT-Tone) fine-tuned on financial sentiment analysis. Our findings suggest
that reasoning, either through prompting or inherent model design, does not
improve performance on this task. Surprisingly, the most accurate and
human-aligned combination of model and method was GPT-4o without any
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. We further explore how performance is
impacted by linguistic complexity and annotation agreement levels, uncovering
that reasoning may introduce overthinking, leading to suboptimal predictions.
This suggests that for financial sentiment classification, fast, intuitive
"System 1"-like thinking aligns more closely with human judgment compared to
"System 2"-style slower, deliberative reasoning simulated by reasoning models
or CoT prompting. Our results challenge the default assumption that more
reasoning always leads to better LLM decisions, particularly in high-stakes
financial applications.

Method: 通过逻辑不变的词汇多样化创建SCALe基准，提出基于表达统一表的MenTaL翻译方法

Result: 实验证实LLMs存在翻译缺陷，应用MenTaL后翻译性能显著提升（支持上下文学习和SFT）

Conclusion: SCALe基准有效暴露LLMs的翻译局限性，MenTaL为构建可靠神经符号系统提供新方向

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic approaches combining large language models (LLMs) with solvers
excels in logical reasoning problems need long reasoning chains. In this
paradigm, LLMs serve as translators, converting natural language reasoning
problems into formal logic formulas. Then reliable symbolic solvers return
correct solutions. Despite their success, we find that LLMs, as translators,
struggle to handle lexical diversification, a common linguistic phenomenon,
indicating that LLMs as logic translators are unreliable in real-world
scenarios. Moreover, existing logical reasoning benchmarks lack lexical
diversity, failing to challenge LLMs' ability to translate such text and thus
obscuring this issue. In this work, we propose SCALe, a benchmark designed to
address this significant gap through **logic-invariant lexical
diversification**. By using LLMs to transform original benchmark datasets into
lexically diversified but logically equivalent versions, we evaluate LLMs'
ability to consistently map diverse expressions to uniform logical symbols on
these new datasets. Experiments using SCALe further confirm that current LLMs
exhibit deficiencies in this capability. Building directly on the deficiencies
identified through our benchmark, we propose a new method, MenTaL, to address
this limitation. This method guides LLMs to first construct a table unifying
diverse expressions before performing translation. Applying MenTaL through
in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) significantly improves the
performance of LLM translators on lexically diversified text. Our code is now
available at https://github.com/wufeiwuwoshihua/LexicalDiver.

Motivation: 现有多示例上下文学习依赖随机示例选择，但实例级检索不适用于多示例场景。受微调数据需求启发，尝试通过梯度匹配提升示例选择效果

Method: 基于小模型（Qwen2.5-3B/Llama3-8B）进行梯度匹配，选择能使示例子集梯度与完整训练集对齐的样本

Result: 在9个数据集上128-shot场景中，Qwen2.5-72B/Llama3-70B提升4%，5个闭源大模型提升约2%

Conclusion: 该工作突破多示例上下文学习的可靠性瓶颈，为实际应用奠定基础

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) for rapid
task adaptation without Fine-Tuning (FT), but its reliance on demonstration
selection remains a critical challenge. While many-shot ICL shows promising
performance through scaled demonstrations, the selection method for many-shot
demonstrations remains limited to random selection in existing work. Since the
conventional instance-level retrieval is not suitable for many-shot scenarios,
we hypothesize that the data requirements for in-context learning and
fine-tuning are analogous. To this end, we introduce a novel gradient matching
approach that selects demonstrations by aligning fine-tuning gradients between
the entire training set of the target task and the selected examples, so as to
approach the learning effect on the entire training set within the selected
examples. Through gradient matching on relatively small models, e.g.,
Qwen2.5-3B or Llama3-8B, our method consistently outperforms random selection
on larger LLMs from 4-shot to 128-shot scenarios across 9 diverse datasets. For
instance, it surpasses random selection by 4% on Qwen2.5-72B and Llama3-70B,
and by around 2% on 5 closed-source LLMs. This work unlocks more reliable and
effective many-shot ICL, paving the way for its broader application.

Result: 在两个事实核查数据集上检索准确率和标签预测准确率均显著超越四个基于声明分解的基线模型

Conclusion: 模块化框架通过分步处理对抗性声明，有效提升事实核查系统的鲁棒性和准确性

Abstract: Automatic fact-checking has recently received more attention as a means of
combating misinformation. Despite significant advancements, fact-checking
systems based on retrieval-augmented language models still struggle to tackle
adversarial claims, which are intentionally designed by humans to challenge
fact-checking systems. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free
method designed to rephrase the original claim, making it easier to locate
supporting evidence. Our modular framework, SUCEA, decomposes the task into
three steps: 1) Claim Segmentation and Decontextualization that segments
adversarial claims into independent sub-claims; 2) Iterative Evidence Retrieval
and Claim Editing that iteratively retrieves evidence and edits the subclaim
based on the retrieved evidence; 3) Evidence Aggregation and Label Prediction
that aggregates all retrieved evidence and predicts the entailment label.
Experiments on two challenging fact-checking datasets demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves on both retrieval and entailment label
accuracy, outperforming four strong claim-decomposition-based baselines.

Result: 多数模型表现差（F1 0.3-0.5），最佳模型仅0.77 F1；存在支持声明偏见，证据定位错误率高达80%，跨模态信息整合能力薄弱

Conclusion: 当前模型在科学声明验证任务中暴露多模态理解缺陷，需提升图表要素理解、证据定位和跨模态推理能力以支持科学论证

Abstract: Assessing scientific claims requires identifying, extracting, and reasoning
with multimodal data expressed in information-rich figures in scientific
literature. Despite the large body of work in scientific QA, figure captioning,
and other multimodal reasoning tasks over chart-based data, there are no
readily usable multimodal benchmarks that directly test claim verification
abilities. To remedy this gap, we introduce a new benchmark MuSciClaims
accompanied by diagnostics tasks. We automatically extract supported claims
from scientific articles, which we manually perturb to produce contradicted
claims. The perturbations are designed to test for a specific set of claim
verification capabilities. We also introduce a suite of diagnostic tasks that
help understand model failures. Our results show most vision-language models
are poor (~0.3-0.5 F1), with even the best model only achieving 0.77 F1. They
are also biased towards judging claims as supported, likely misunderstanding
nuanced perturbations within the claims. Our diagnostics show models are bad at
localizing correct evidence within figures, struggle with aggregating
information across modalities, and often fail to understand basic components of
the figure.

Abstract: We introduce LESS (Large Language Model Enhanced Semi-supervised Learning), a
versatile framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to correct

pseudo-labeled text from Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) or Automatic Speech

by a data filtering strategy to optimize LLM knowledge transfer efficiency.
Experiments on both Mandarin ASR and Spanish-to-English AST tasks show that
LESS achieves a notable absolute WER reduction of 3.77% on the Wenet Speech
test set, as well as BLEU scores of 34.0 and 64.7 on Callhome and Fisher test

Conclusion: 首次将形式数学验证应用于LLM生成内容，符合形式语言确保数学证明可靠性的本质需求

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has become the de facto method to elicit
reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). However, to mitigate
hallucinations in CoT that are notoriously difficult to detect, current methods
such as process reward models (PRMs) or self-consistency operate as opaque
boxes and do not provide checkable evidence for their judgments, possibly
limiting their effectiveness. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from
the idea that "the gold standard for supporting a mathematical claim is to
provide a proof". We propose a retrospective, step-aware formal verification
framework $Safe$. Rather than assigning arbitrary scores, we strive to
articulate mathematical claims in formal mathematical language Lean 4 at each
reasoning step and provide formal proofs to identify hallucinations. We
evaluate our framework $Safe$ across multiple language models and various
mathematical datasets, demonstrating a significant performance improvement
while offering interpretable and verifiable evidence. We also propose
$FormalStep$ as a benchmark for step correctness theorem proving with $30,809$
formal statements. To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the first
endeavor to utilize formal mathematical language Lean 4 for verifying natural
language content generated by LLMs, aligning with the reason why formal
mathematical languages were created in the first place: to provide a robust
foundation for hallucination-prone human-written proofs.

Abstract: Scientific Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of predicting the
semantic relation between a pair of sentences extracted from research articles.
Existing datasets for this task are derived from various computer science (CS)
domains, whereas non-CS domains are completely ignored. In this paper, we
introduce a novel evaluation benchmark for scientific NLI, called MISMATCHED.
The new MISMATCHED benchmark covers three non-CS domains-PSYCHOLOGY,
ENGINEERING, and PUBLIC HEALTH, and contains 2,700 human annotated sentence
pairs. We establish strong baselines on MISMATCHED using both Pre-trained Small
Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our best performing
baseline shows a Macro F1 of only 78.17% illustrating the substantial headroom
for future improvements. In addition to introducing the MISMATCHED benchmark,
we show that incorporating sentence pairs having an implicit scientific NLI
relation between them in model training improves their performance on
scientific NLI. We make our dataset and code publicly available on GitHub.

Conclusion: 生成多样性是提升TTS效果的关键要素，通过针对性优化可突破现有计算效率瓶颈。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves the reasoning performance of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by allocating additional compute during inference. We conduct a
structured survey of TTS methods and categorize them into sampling-based,
search-based, and trajectory optimization strategies. We observe that
reasoning-optimized models often produce less diverse outputs, which limits TTS
effectiveness. To address this, we propose ADAPT (A Diversity Aware Prefix
fine-Tuning), a lightweight method that applies prefix tuning with a
diversity-focused data strategy. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks
show that ADAPT reaches 80% accuracy using eight times less compute than strong
baselines. Our findings highlight the essential role of generative diversity in
maximizing TTS effectiveness.

Abstract: Existing studies of innovation emphasize the power of social structures to
shape innovation capacity. Emerging machine learning approaches, however,
enable us to model innovators' personal perspectives and interpersonal
innovation opportunities as a function of their prior trajectories of
experience. We theorize then quantify subjective perspectives and innovation
opportunities based on innovator positions within the geometric space of
concepts inscribed by dynamic language representations. Using data on millions
of scientists, inventors, writers, entrepreneurs, and Wikipedia contributors
across the creative domains of science, technology, film, entrepreneurship, and
Wikipedia, here we show that measured subjective perspectives anticipate what
ideas individuals and groups creatively attend to and successfully combine in
future. When perspective and background diversity are decomposed as the angular
difference between collaborators' perspectives on their creation and between
their experiences, the former consistently anticipates creative achievement
while the latter portends its opposite, across all cases and time periods
examined. We analyze a natural experiment and simulate creative collaborations
between AI (large language model) agents designed with various perspective and
background diversity, which are consistent with our observational findings. We
explore mechanisms underlying these findings and identify how successful
collaborators leverage common language to weave together diverse experience
obtained through trajectories of prior work that converge to provoke one
another and innovate. We explore the importance of these findings for team
assembly and research policy.

Conclusion: 该方法在保持计算效率的同时实现了接近动态模型的语义表征效果，为静态词向量在句子级任务中的应用提供了新思路

Abstract: We propose new static word embeddings optimised for sentence semantic
representation. We first extract word embeddings from a pre-trained Sentence
Transformer, and improve them with sentence-level principal component analysis,
followed by either knowledge distillation or contrastive learning. During
inference, we represent sentences by simply averaging word embeddings, which
requires little computational cost. We evaluate models on both monolingual and
cross-lingual tasks and show that our model substantially outperforms existing
static models on sentence semantic tasks, and even rivals a basic Sentence
Transformer model (SimCSE) on some data sets. Lastly, we perform a variety of
analyses and show that our method successfully removes word embedding
components that are irrelevant to sentence semantics, and adjusts the vector
norms based on the influence of words on sentence semantics.

TL;DR: Tool-MVR通过多智能体验证框架和动态反思学习机制，显著提升大语言模型的工具规划可靠性和错误修正能力，在多个基准测试中实现SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有大模型工具调用存在的两大核心缺陷：（1）低质量指令集导致的API调用不可靠（如广泛存在的虚假API调用）；（2）静态模仿学习导致的工具反思能力薄弱（超90%错误无法修正）。

Method: 1. 提出多智能体元验证框架（MAMV），通过API/查询/推理轨迹三重验证构建高质量工具指令集ToolBench-V；2. 设计基于探索的反思学习（EXPLORE），通过动态的「错误->反思->修正」学习范式生成工具反思数据集ToolBench-R。

Result: 在StableToolBench上准确率超越ToolLLM 23.9%和GPT-4 15.3%，API调用减少31.4%；在RefineToolBench反思基准上实现58.9%的错误修正率（ToolLLM仅9.1%）。

Conclusion: Tool-MVR通过系统2推理框架的创新整合，成功实现了工具验证与动态反思的协同优化，为构建可靠的工具增强型LLM提供了新的方法论范式。

Abstract: Empowering large language models (LLMs) with effective tool utilization
capabilities is crucial for enabling AI agents to solve complex problems.
However, current models face two major limitations: (1) unreliable tool
planning and invocation due to low-quality instruction datasets (e.g.,
widespread hallucinated API calls), and (2) weak tool reflection abilities
(over 90% of errors cannot be corrected) resulting from static imitation
learning. To address these critical limitations, we propose Tool-MVR, a novel
Tool-Augmented LLM that achieves comprehensive System 2 reasoning through two
key innovations. Specifically, we first introduce Multi-Agent Meta-Verification
(MAMV), a systematic pipeline that rigorously validates APIs, queries, and
reasoning trajectories to construct ToolBench-V, a new high-quality instruction
dataset that addresses the limitation of unreliable tool planning and
invocation. Second, we propose Exploration-based Reflection Learning (EXPLORE),
which enhances tool reflection capabilities by leveraging tool feedback through
a dynamic "Error -> Reflection -> Correction" learning paradigm, resulting in
our reflection dataset ToolBench-R and addressing the critical weakness in tool
reflection. Finally, we obtain Tool-MVR by finetuning open-source LLMs (e.g.,
Qwen-7B) on both ToolBench-V and ToolBench-R. Our experiments demonstrate that
Tool-MVR achieves state-of-the-art performance on StableToolBench, surpassing
both ToolLLM (by 23.9%) and GPT-4 (by 15.3%) while reducing API calls by 31.4%,
with strong generalization capabilities across unseen tools and scenarios.
Additionally, on our proposed RefineToolBench, the first benchmark specifically
designed to evaluate tool reflection capabilities, Tool-MVR achieves a 58.9%
error correction rate, significantly outperforming ToolLLM's 9.1%.

Motivation: 解决非英语视听语音识别数据集稀缺问题，特别是资源匮乏语言的扩展需求，突破现有数据收集效率瓶颈

Method: 优化原始视频自动化处理流程，建立越南语AVSR基线模型，验证从视频自动提取数据的可行性

Result: 自动构建的数据集使AVSR在安静环境达到传统ASR水平，在鸡尾酒会等噪声场景中表现显著优于纯音频系统

Conclusion: 该方法为扩展多语言AVSR提供高效路径，特别有利于资源匮乏语言实现抗噪声语音识别

Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) has gained significant attention
recently due to its robustness against noise, which often challenges
conventional speech recognition systems that rely solely on audio features.
Despite this advantage, AVSR models remain limited by the scarcity of extensive
datasets, especially for most languages beyond English. Automated data
collection offers a promising solution. This work presents a practical approach
to generate AVSR datasets from raw video, refining existing techniques for
improved efficiency and accessibility. We demonstrate its broad applicability
by developing a baseline AVSR model for Vietnamese. Experiments show the
automatically collected dataset enables a strong baseline, achieving
competitive performance with robust ASR in clean conditions and significantly
outperforming them in noisy environments like cocktail parties. This efficient
method provides a pathway to expand AVSR to more languages, particularly
under-resourced ones.

<details>

Motivation: Transformer模型的KV缓存内存需求随序列长度急剧增长，传统量化方法需单独处理稀疏异常值导致效率低下

Method: 1. 层间误差敏感度自适应的量化精度分配 2. 均值中心化消除异常值单独处理需求

Result: 实验显示内存占用降至16bit基线的27%，在标准测试集上保持可比精度，无需单独管理异常值元素

Conclusion: 该方法为语言模型的长上下文推理、思维链扩展提供了高效内存解决方案，支持大模型规模化部署

Abstract: The key-value (KV) cache in transformer models is a critical component for
efficient decoding or inference, yet its memory demands scale poorly with
sequence length, posing a major challenge for scalable deployment of large
language models. Among several approaches to KV cache compression, quantization
of key and value activations has been widely explored. Most KV cache
quantization methods still need to manage sparse and noncontiguous outliers
separately. To address this, we introduce TaDA, a training-free recipe for KV
cache compression with quantization precision that adapts to error sensitivity
across layers and a mean centering to eliminate separate outlier handling. Our
approach yields substantial accuracy improvements for multiple models
supporting various context lengths. Moreover, our approach does not need to
separately manage outlier elements -- a persistent hurdle in most traditional
quantization methods. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
technique reduces KV cache memory footprint to 27% of the original 16-bit
baseline while achieving comparable accuracy. Our method paves the way for
scalable and high-performance reasoning in language models by potentially
enabling inference for longer context length models, reasoning models, and
longer chain of thoughts.

Motivation: 现有基准局限于静态单轮场景，无法反映现实规划中动态需求变化和约束竞争的问题

Method: 基于TravelPlanner数据集构建两种新评估场景：1) 多轮顺序约束引入 2) 显式优先级的竞争约束场景，使用GPT-4o和Llama 3.1 70B进行测试

Result: 模型单轮表现无法预测多轮调整能力；约束引入顺序显著影响性能；模型存在优先级误判倾向（偏好新低优先级约束）

Conclusion: 需在动态场景评估LLMs规划能力，改进方向应聚焦多轮调整机制和优先级处理算法

Abstract: Real-world planning problems require constant adaptation to changing
requirements and balancing of competing constraints. However, current
benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities primarily focus on
static, single-turn scenarios. We introduce Flex-TravelPlanner, a benchmark
that evaluates language models' ability to reason flexibly in dynamic planning
scenarios. Building on the TravelPlanner dataset~\citep{xie2024travelplanner},
we introduce two novel evaluation settings: (1) sequential constraint
introduction across multiple turns, and (2) scenarios with explicitly
prioritized competing constraints. Our analysis of GPT-4o and Llama 3.1 70B
reveals several key findings: models' performance on single-turn tasks poorly
predicts their ability to adapt plans across multiple turns; constraint
introduction order significantly affects performance; and models struggle with
constraint prioritization, often incorrectly favoring newly introduced lower
priority preferences over existing higher-priority constraints. These findings
highlight the importance of evaluating LLMs in more realistic, dynamic planning
scenarios and suggest specific directions for improving model performance on
complex planning tasks. The code and dataset for our framework are publicly
available at https://github.com/juhyunohh/FlexTravelBench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The progress of AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) raises
increasingly pressing concerns about their safe deployment. This paper examines
the value alignment problem for LLMs, arguing that current alignment strategies
are fundamentally inadequate to prevent misuse. Despite ongoing efforts to
instill norms such as helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness in LLMs through
fine-tuning based on human preferences, they remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that exploit conflicts between these norms. I argue that this
vulnerability reflects a fundamental limitation of existing alignment methods:
they reinforce shallow behavioral dispositions rather than endowing LLMs with a
genuine capacity for normative deliberation. Drawing from on research in moral
psychology, I show how humans' ability to engage in deliberative reasoning
enhances their resilience against similar adversarial tactics. LLMs, by
contrast, lack a robust capacity to detect and rationally resolve normative
conflicts, leaving them susceptible to manipulation; even recent advances in
reasoning-focused LLMs have not addressed this vulnerability. This ``shallow
alignment'' problem carries significant implications for AI safety and
regulation, suggesting that current approaches are insufficient for mitigating
potential harms posed by increasingly capable AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预训练依赖网络爬取数据，但高质量文本仅占1%且增速有限。传统过滤流程丢弃99%数据导致数据墙问题，需要有效回收利用被弃数据。

Method: 开发基于引导式改写（guided rewrite）的REWIRE方法，将低质量文档转化为可用训练数据。通过混合原始高质量文本与改写文本优化训练集构成。

Result: 在DCLM基准测试中，1B/3B/7B模型混合训练数据分别提升1.0/1.3/2.5个百分点。82%有效数据来自原本被弃文本，效果优于单纯倍增原始数据。

Conclusion: 网络文本回收是突破预训练数据瓶颈的有效方案。REWIRE相比问答生成、知识抽取等传统合成方法更具优势，为数据扩展提供新思路。

Abstract: Scaling laws predict that the performance of large language models improves
with increasing model size and data size. In practice, pre-training has been
relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available
on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the
same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality
texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of
the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the "data wall"
of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data
discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web
with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they
could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the
representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at
1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw
texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points
improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only
filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more
effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we
demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming
lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also
outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including
Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge
extraction. These results suggest that recycling web texts holds the potential
for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data.

Motivation: 现有自动检测方法对显式仇恨言论有效，但难以识别更隐蔽的隐式仇恨言论，需开发针对性解决方案

Method: 1) 构建包含六种编码策略的隐式仇恨分类体系 2) 开发基于LLMs的两种检测方法：直接响应分类和编码嵌入策略

Result: 在中英文数据集上验证编码策略的有效性，实验显示检测性能显著提升

Conclusion: 通过系统化编码策略与LLMs的结合，成功突破隐式仇恨检测瓶颈，实现跨语言适用性

Abstract: The internet has become a hotspot for hate speech (HS), threatening societal
harmony and individual well-being. While automatic detection methods perform
well in identifying explicit hate speech (ex-HS), they struggle with more
subtle forms, such as implicit hate speech (im-HS). We tackle this problem by
introducing a new taxonomy for im-HS detection, defining six encoding
strategies named codetypes. We present two methods for integrating codetypes
into im-HS detection: 1) prompting large language models (LLMs) directly to
classify sentences based on generated responses, and 2) using LLMs as encoders
with codetypes embedded during the encoding process. Experiments show that the
use of codetypes improves im-HS detection in both Chinese and English datasets,
validating the effectiveness of our approach across different languages.

Result: 在多个基准测试中降低60-65%推理延迟，吞吐量比现有方法提升14-28%，单轨迹场景降低48-58%延迟

Conclusion: STAND作为即插即用解决方案，适用于任何现有语言模型，显著提升推理效率

Abstract: Language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning tasks
through test-time scaling techniques like best-of-N sampling and tree search.
However, these approaches often demand substantial computational resources,
creating a critical trade-off between performance and efficiency. We introduce
STAND (STochastic Adaptive N-gram Drafting), a novel model-free speculative
decoding approach that leverages the inherent redundancy in reasoning
trajectories to achieve significant acceleration without compromising accuracy.
Our analysis reveals that reasoning paths frequently reuse similar reasoning
patterns, enabling efficient model-free token prediction without requiring
separate draft models. By introducing stochastic drafting and preserving
probabilistic information through a memory-efficient logit-based N-gram module,
combined with optimized Gumbel-Top-K sampling and data-driven tree
construction, STAND significantly improves token acceptance rates. Extensive
evaluations across multiple models and reasoning tasks (AIME-2024,
GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench) demonstrate that STAND reduces inference
latency by 60-65% compared to standard autoregressive decoding while
maintaining accuracy. Furthermore, STAND outperforms state-of-the-art
speculative decoding methods by 14-28% in throughput and shows strong
performance even in single-trajectory scenarios, reducing inference latency by
48-58%. As a model-free approach, STAND can be applied to any existing language
model without additional training, being a powerful plug-and-play solution for
accelerating language model reasoning.

Abstract: This paper presents the submission of IIITH-BUT to the IWSLT 2025 shared task
on speech translation for the low-resource Bhojpuri-Hindi language pair. We
explored the impact of hyperparameter optimisation and data augmentation
techniques on the performance of the SeamlessM4T model fine-tuned for this

including learning rate schedules, number of update steps, warm-up steps, label
smoothing, and batch sizes; and report their effect on translation quality. To
address data scarcity, we applied speed perturbation and SpecAugment and
studied their effect on translation quality. We also examined the use of
cross-lingual signal through joint training with Marathi and Bhojpuri speech

application of simple yet effective augmentation techniques significantly
improve performance in low-resource settings. We also analysed the translation
hypotheses to understand various kinds of errors that impacted the translation
quality in terms of BLEU.

Motivation: 解决单一模型生成多样性不足和评估偏见问题，利用多模型协作形成动态竞争生态。

Conclusion: 集体竞争机制有效激发模型自我进化，通过声誉系统平衡评估权重，利用模型多样性产生更优质的输出。

Abstract: We propose SPARTA ALIGNMENT, an algorithm to collectively align multiple LLMs
through competition and combat. To complement a single model's lack of
diversity in generation and biases in evaluation, multiple LLMs form a "sparta
tribe" to compete against each other in fulfilling instructions while serving
as judges for the competition of others. For each iteration, one instruction
and two models are selected for a duel, the other models evaluate the two
responses, and their evaluation scores are aggregated through a adapted
elo-ranking based reputation system, where winners/losers of combat gain/lose
weight in evaluating others. The peer-evaluated combat results then become
preference pairs where the winning response is preferred over the losing one,
and all models learn from these preferences at the end of each iteration.
SPARTA ALIGNMENT enables the self-evolution of multiple LLMs in an iterative
and collective competition process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SPARTA ALIGNMENT outperforms initial models and 4 self-alignment baselines
across 10 out of 12 tasks and datasets with 7.0% average improvement. Further
analysis reveals that SPARTA ALIGNMENT generalizes more effectively to unseen
tasks and leverages the expertise diversity of participating models to produce
more logical, direct and informative outputs.

Conclusion: C²EFND成功实现LLMs与SLMs优势互补，通过协同进化机制为动态假新闻检测提供创新解决方案

Abstract: The widespread dissemination of fake news on social media has significantly
impacted society, resulting in serious consequences. Conventional deep learning
methodologies employing small language models (SLMs) suffer from extensive
supervised training requirements and difficulties adapting to evolving news
environments due to data scarcity and distribution shifts. Large language
models (LLMs), despite robust zero-shot capabilities, fall short in accurately
detecting fake news owing to outdated knowledge and the absence of suitable
demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel Continuous Collaborative
Emergent Fake News Detection (C$^2$EFND) framework to address these challenges.
The C$^2$EFND framework strategically leverages both LLMs' generalization power
and SLMs' classification expertise via a multi-round collaborative learning
framework. We further introduce a lifelong knowledge editing module based on a
Mixture-of-Experts architecture to incrementally update LLMs and a replay-based
continue learning method to ensure SLMs retain prior knowledge without
retraining entirely. Extensive experiments on Pheme and Twitter16 datasets
demonstrate that C$^2$EFND significantly outperforms existed methods,
effectively improving detection accuracy and adaptability in continuous
emergent fake news scenarios.

Abstract: Evaluating text revision in scientific writing remains a challenge, as
traditional metrics such as ROUGE and BERTScore primarily focus on similarity
rather than capturing meaningful improvements. In this work, we analyse and
identify the limitations of these metrics and explore alternative evaluation
methods that better align with human judgments. We first conduct a manual
annotation study to assess the quality of different revisions. Then, we
investigate reference-free evaluation metrics from related NLP domains.
Additionally, we examine LLM-as-a-judge approaches, analysing their ability to
assess revisions with and without a gold reference. Our results show that LLMs
effectively assess instruction-following but struggle with correctness, while
domain-specific metrics provide complementary insights. We find that a hybrid
approach combining LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and task-specific metrics offers
the most reliable assessment of revision quality.

Conclusion: 多维度表征工程显著提升LLM政治概念分析的透明度，为模型政治立场检测和调控提供有效技术路径

Abstract: Studies of LLMs' political opinions mainly rely on evaluations of their
open-ended responses. Recent work indicates that there is a misalignment
between LLMs' responses and their internal intentions. This motivates us to
probe LLMs' internal mechanisms and help uncover their internal political
states. Additionally, we found that the analysis of LLMs' political opinions
often relies on single-axis concepts, which can lead to concept confounds. In
this work, we extend the single-axis to multi-dimensions and apply
interpretable representation engineering techniques for more transparent LLM
political concept learning. Specifically, we designed a four-dimensional
political learning framework and constructed a corresponding dataset for
fine-grained political concept vector learning. These vectors can be used to
detect and intervene in LLM internals. Experiments are conducted on eight
open-source LLMs with three representation engineering techniques. Results show
these vectors can disentangle political concept confounds. Detection tasks
validate the semantic meaning of the vectors and show good generalization and
robustness in OOD settings. Intervention Experiments show these vectors can
intervene in LLMs to generate responses with different political leanings.

Abstract: Speech inherently contains rich acoustic information that extends far beyond
the textual language. In real-world spoken language understanding, effective
interpretation often requires integrating semantic meaning (e.g., content),
paralinguistic features (e.g., emotions, speed, pitch) and phonological
characteristics (e.g., prosody, intonation, rhythm), which are embedded in
speech. While recent multimodal Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing audio information, their
ability to perform fine-grained perception and complex reasoning in natural
speech remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce MMSU, a
comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for understanding and reasoning
in spoken language. MMSU comprises 5,000 meticulously curated
audio-question-answer triplets across 47 distinct tasks. To ground our
benchmark in linguistic theory, we systematically incorporate a wide range of
linguistic phenomena, including phonetics, prosody, rhetoric, syntactics,
semantics, and paralinguistics. Through a rigorous evaluation of 14 advanced
SpeechLLMs, we identify substantial room for improvement in existing models,
highlighting meaningful directions for future optimization. MMSU establishes a
new standard for comprehensive assessment of spoken language understanding,
providing valuable insights for developing more sophisticated human-AI speech
interaction systems. MMSU benchmark is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补现有文献中不同模态与语言主干连接机制的系统性分析空白，为预训练基础模型的多模态集成提供指导

Method: 通过分析125个MLLMs案例，从架构整合机制、表征学习（联合/协调）和训练范式（策略/目标函数）三个维度建立分类体系

Result: 构建出首个LLM-centric的MLLMs分类框架，揭示模态融合层级、表征对齐方式与训练策略间的关联模式

Conclusion: 该分类法为研究者提供系统参考框架，指导开发更鲁棒的多模态集成方案，推动基于预训练基础模型的多模态系统演进

Abstract: The rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) has transformed
the AI landscape. These models combine pre-trained LLMs with various modality
encoders. This integration requires a systematic understanding of how different
modalities connect to the language backbone. Our survey presents an LLM-centric
analysis of current approaches. We examine methods for transforming and
aligning diverse modal inputs into the language embedding space. This addresses
a significant gap in existing literature. We propose a classification framework
for MLLMs based on three key dimensions. First, we examine architectural
strategies for modality integration. This includes both the specific
integration mechanisms and the fusion level. Second, we categorize
representation learning techniques as either joint or coordinate
representations. Third, we analyze training paradigms, including training
strategies and objective functions. By examining 125 MLLMs developed between
2021 and 2025, we identify emerging patterns in the field. Our taxonomy
provides researchers with a structured overview of current integration
techniques. These insights aim to guide the development of more robust
multimodal integration strategies for future models built on pre-trained
foundations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准仅依赖最终答案准确性，无法全面评估推理过程的质量和结构完整性

Method: 构建四种监督格式(自然语言+三种符号)，在不同监督下训练语言模型并对比分析效果

Result: 自然语言监督在分布外数据和长上下文任务中表现优异，符号监督产生更结构化、原子化的推理链。表示层分析表明微调主要通过逐步生成改善推理而非捷径预测

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM逻辑推理能力提供了更严格、可解释的评估体系，监督方式选择需权衡泛化能力与结构严谨性

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a core capability for many applications of large
language models (LLMs), yet existing benchmarks often rely solely on
final-answer accuracy, failing to capture the quality and structure of the
reasoning process. We propose FineLogic, a fine-grained evaluation framework
that assesses logical reasoning across three dimensions: overall benchmark
accuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level alignment. In addition,
to better understand how reasoning capabilities emerge, we conduct a
comprehensive study on the effects of supervision format during fine-tuning. We
construct four supervision styles (one natural language and three symbolic
variants) and train LLMs under each. Our findings reveal that natural language
supervision yields strong generalization even on out-of-distribution and
long-context tasks, while symbolic reasoning styles promote more structurally
sound and atomic inference chains. Further, our representation-level probing
shows that fine-tuning primarily improves reasoning behaviors through
step-by-step generation, rather than enhancing shortcut prediction or
internalized correctness. Together, our framework and analysis provide a more
rigorous and interpretable lens for evaluating and improving logical reasoning
in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器翻译存在需要人工编辑的错误，需要更有效的校对方法提升翻译质量

Method: CNN提取局部n-gram特征，BERT建模全局上下文；集成错误检测模块（基于注意力机制识别词序错误/遗漏）+ GRU解码器校正模块（结合翻译记忆库）；使用WMT和Open-Subtitles双语语料训练，多损失函数联合优化

Result: 实验取得90%准确率、89.37% F1值和16.24% MSE，整体性能超越现有校对技术10%以上

Conclusion: 该混合方法在误译检测和语义连贯校正方面达到SOTA，尤其在处理词序问题和文本遗漏时表现突出

Abstract: Since automatic translations can contain errors that require substantial
human post-editing, machine translation proofreading is essential for improving
quality. This paper proposes a novel hybrid approach for robust proofreading
that combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) with Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT). In order to extract semantic
information from phrases and expressions, CNN uses a variety of convolution
kernel filters to capture local n-gram patterns. In the meanwhile, BERT creates
context-rich representations of whole sequences by utilizing stacked
bidirectional transformer encoders. Using BERT's attention processes, the
integrated error detection component relates tokens to spot translation
irregularities including word order problems and omissions. The correction
module then uses parallel English-German alignment and GRU decoder models in
conjunction with translation memory to propose logical modifications that
maintain original meaning. A unified end-to-end training process optimized for
post-editing performance is applied to the whole pipeline. The multi-domain
collection of WMT and the conversational dialogues of Open-Subtitles are two of
the English-German parallel corpora used to train the model. Multiple loss
functions supervise detection and correction capabilities. Experiments attain a
90% accuracy, 89.37% F1, and 16.24% MSE, exceeding recent proofreading
techniques by over 10% overall. Comparative benchmarking demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance in identifying and coherently rectifying
mistranslations and omissions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI教育评估工具在欠发达地区课堂的真实应用效果，填补现有研究在弱势教育场景中的实践空白。

Method: 使用先进VLM和多个LLM分析印尼6所学校646份手写试卷（含14,000+答案），涵盖数学和英语科目的多题型批改与个性化反馈生成。

Result: VLM手写识别错误导致LLM评分误差传递，但基于错误输入的反馈仍部分有效，个性化程度和情境适配性存在局限。

Conclusion: 当前模型在欠发达教育场景中展现有限潜力，需提升手写识别准确率和上下文理解能力，未来应加强系统鲁棒性以支持教育公平。

Abstract: Although vision-language and large language models (VLM and LLM) offer
promising opportunities for AI-driven educational assessment, their
effectiveness in real-world classroom settings, particularly in
underrepresented educational contexts, remains underexplored. In this study, we
evaluated the performance of a state-of-the-art VLM and several LLMs on 646
handwritten exam responses from grade 4 students in six Indonesian schools,
covering two subjects: Mathematics and English. These sheets contain more than
14K student answers that span multiple choice, short answer, and essay
questions. Assessment tasks include grading these responses and generating
personalized feedback. Our findings show that the VLM often struggles to
accurately recognize student handwriting, leading to error propagation in
downstream LLM grading. Nevertheless, LLM-generated feedback retains some
utility, even when derived from imperfect input, although limitations in
personalization and contextual relevance persist.

Motivation: 加密填字游戏谜题需要同时解决答案定义和验证字谜逻辑，现有系统缺乏可验证的推理过程和开源实现。

Method: 构建三阶段系统：1) 假设答案生成 2) 字谜解释推导 3) 基于Python编码推理步骤的验证系统

Result: 在泰晤士报/每日电讯报的Cryptonite数据集上实现新SOTA，所有解决方案均通过可解释的Python代码呈现推理过程

Conclusion: 结合开放组件与结构化验证的系统，在保持高性能的同时提供透明化的字谜解题路径，为复杂语言推理任务建立新范式

Abstract: Cryptic crossword clues are challenging language tasks for which new test
sets are released daily by major newspapers on a global basis. Each cryptic
clue contains both the definition of the answer to be placed in the crossword
grid (in common with regular crosswords), and 'wordplay' that proves that the
answer is correct (i.e. a human solver can be confident that an answer is
correct without needing crossing words as confirmation). This work describes an
LLM-based reasoning system built from open-licensed components that solves
cryptic clues by (i) hypothesising answers; (ii) proposing wordplay
explanations; and (iii) using a verifier system that operates on codified
reasoning steps. Overall, this system establishes a new state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging Cryptonite dataset of clues from The Times and
The Telegraph newspapers in the UK. Because each proved solution is expressed
in Python, interpretable wordplay reasoning for proven answers is available for
inspection.

Motivation: 现有幻觉检测方法聚焦答案层不确定性，无法有效识别推理轨迹中的逻辑不一致问题，这对依赖显式思维链的LRMs尤为关键

Method: 提取核心推理步骤，计算四维信号：推理轨迹的样本间一致性、答案熵不确定性、推理与答案语义对齐度、推理过程自洽性

Result: 跨数据集和不同LLM的实验表明RACE显著优于现有基线，即使答案正确也能检测潜在幻觉

Conclusion: RACE为LRMs评估提供了可泛化的解决方案，通过细粒度推理-答案联合分析提升检测鲁棒性

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) extend large language models with explicit,
multi-step reasoning traces to enhance transparency and performance on complex
tasks. However, these reasoning traces can be redundant or logically
inconsistent, making them a new source of hallucination that is difficult to
detect. Existing hallucination detection methods focus primarily on
answer-level uncertainty and often fail to detect hallucinations or logical
inconsistencies arising from the model's reasoning trace. This oversight is
particularly problematic for LRMs, where the explicit thinking trace is not
only an important support to the model's decision-making process but also a key
source of potential hallucination. To this end, we propose RACE (Reasoning and
Answer Consistency Evaluation), a novel framework specifically tailored for
hallucination detection in LRMs. RACE operates by extracting essential
reasoning steps and computing four diagnostic signals: inter-sample consistency
of reasoning traces, entropy-based answer uncertainty, semantic alignment
between reasoning and answers, and internal coherence of reasoning. This joint
analysis enables fine-grained hallucination detection even when the final
answer appears correct. Experiments across datasets and different LLMs
demonstrate that RACE outperforms existing hallucination detection baselines,
offering a robust and generalizable solution for evaluating LRMs. Our code is
available at: https://github.com/bebr2/RACE.

Result: 成功发布包含转录对齐的数据集及标注工具，提出自动对齐基线方法与评估指标

Conclusion: 该资源填补了同声传译研究基础设施空白，为自动监控与评估提供关键支持

Abstract: In simultaneous interpreting, an interpreter renders a source speech into
another language with a very short lag, much sooner than sentences are
finished. In order to understand and later reproduce this dynamic and complex
task automatically, we need dedicated datasets and tools for analysis,
monitoring, and evaluation, such as parallel speech corpora, and tools for
their automatic annotation. Existing parallel corpora of translated texts and
associated alignment algorithms hardly fill this gap, as they fail to model
long-range interactions between speech segments or specific types of
divergences (e.g., shortening, simplification, functional generalization)
between the original and interpreted speeches. In this work, we introduce
MockConf, a student interpreting dataset that was collected from Mock
Conferences run as part of the students' curriculum. This dataset contains 7
hours of recordings in 5 European languages, transcribed and aligned at the
level of spans and words. We further implement and release InterAlign, a modern
web-based annotation tool for parallel word and span annotations on long
inputs, suitable for aligning simultaneous interpreting. We propose metrics for
the evaluation and a baseline for automatic alignment. Dataset and tools are
released to the community.

Motivation: 解决教育工作者手动创建MCQs时面临的时间成本高、认知负荷大的问题，探索LLMs自动化生成试题的可行性。

Method: 采用知识注入法（避免模型幻觉），让教育工作者控制测试源文本，通过21位教育工作者的实验评估模型生成的MCQs质量。

Result: GPT-3.5在多项指标中生成效果最佳，但实验同时显示教育领域对AI应用仍存在保留态度。

Conclusion: LLMs可有效辅助MCQs生成并提升教育体验，但需进一步解决用户信任问题以实现技术落地。

Abstract: Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) in educational settings has brought
new learning approaches, transforming the practices of both students and
educators. Among the various technologies driving this transformation, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for creating educational
materials and question answering, but there are still space for new
applications. Educators commonly use Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) to assess
student knowledge, but manually generating these questions is
resource-intensive and requires significant time and cognitive effort. In our
opinion, LLMs offer a promising solution to these challenges. This paper
presents a novel comparative analysis of three widely known LLMs - Llama 2,
Mistral, and GPT-3.5 - to explore their potential for creating informative and
challenging MCQs. In our approach, we do not rely on the knowledge of the LLM,
but we inject the knowledge into the prompt to contrast the hallucinations,
giving the educators control over the test's source text, too. Our experiment
involving 21 educators shows that GPT-3.5 generates the most effective MCQs
across several known metrics. Additionally, it shows that there is still some
reluctance to adopt AI in the educational field. This study sheds light on the
potential of LLMs to generate MCQs and improve the educational experience,
providing valuable insights for the future.

Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在等距机器翻译任务中的表现，特别是在不同提示策略和样本数量下对翻译质量及长度控制的效果，以优化模型在实际应用中的性能。

Method: 使用八个不同规模的LLMs，在三个语言对中测试不同提示策略、少样本示例数量（5/10/20）及演示选择对结果的影响。

Result: 极端示例促使LLMs生成较短翻译，等距演示导致忽视长度限制；少样本提示提升质量但改进有限，多输出显著改善平衡，部分语言对达到SOTA。

Conclusion: 通过调整提示策略和利用多输出，LLMs在等距翻译中可实现质量与长度的优化，为特定语言对提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: In this study, we explore the effectiveness of isometric machine translation
across multiple language pairs (En$\to$De, En$\to$Fr, and En$\to$Es) under the
conditions of the IWSLT Isometric Shared Task 2022. Using eight open-source
large language models (LLMs) of varying sizes, we investigate how different
prompting strategies, varying numbers of few-shot examples, and demonstration
selection influence translation quality and length control. We discover that
the phrasing of instructions, when aligned with the properties of the provided
demonstrations, plays a crucial role in controlling the output length. Our
experiments show that LLMs tend to produce shorter translations only when
presented with extreme examples, while isometric demonstrations often lead to
the models disregarding length constraints. While few-shot prompting generally
enhances translation quality, further improvements are marginal across 5, 10,
and 20-shot settings. Finally, considering multiple outputs allows to notably
improve overall tradeoff between the length and quality, yielding
state-of-the-art performance for some language pairs.

Method: 通过将UD整合到预训练语言模型中，评估其在跨语言对抗性复述识别任务中的表现。

Result: 实验显示UD显著提升模型性能，平均准确率提升3.85%，F1分数提升6.08%。部分语言对中预训练模型缩小了与LLM的差距甚至反超。

Conclusion: UD与英语的相似度与模型性能呈正相关，验证了其在领域外任务中的有效性，为跨语言处理提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: Universal Dependencies (UD), while widely regarded as the most successful
linguistic framework for cross-lingual syntactic representation, remains
underexplored in terms of its effectiveness. This paper addresses this gap by
integrating UD into pretrained language models and assesses if UD can improve
their performance on a cross-lingual adversarial paraphrase identification
task. Experimental results show that incorporation of UD yields significant
improvements in accuracy and $F_1$ scores, with average gains of 3.85\% and
6.08\% respectively. These enhancements reduce the performance gap between
pretrained models and large language models in some language pairs, and even
outperform the latter in some others. Furthermore, the UD-based similarity
score between a given language and English is positively correlated to the
performance of models in that language. Both findings highlight the validity
and potential of UD in out-of-domain tasks.

Method: 1) 构建包含118道ICPC赛题的基准 2) 开发测试用例生成方法和本地评估工具包 3) 提出Refine@K迭代修复指标

Result: 顶尖模型需多轮代码反馈才能释放推理潜力，当前模型性能仍显著落后于人类顶尖队伍

Conclusion: 复杂推理能力评估仍面临重大挑战，模型与人类表现存在差距，发布开源基准促进研究

Abstract: With the significant progress of large reasoning models in complex coding and
reasoning tasks, existing benchmarks, like LiveCodeBench and CodeElo, are
insufficient to evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) in real competition environments. Moreover, current evaluation metrics
such as Pass@K fail to capture the reflective abilities of reasoning models. To
address these challenges, we propose \textbf{ICPC-Eval}, a top-level
competitive coding benchmark designed to probing the frontiers of LLM
reasoning. ICPC-Eval includes 118 carefully curated problems from 11 recent
ICPC contests held in various regions of the world, offering three key
contributions: 1) A challenging realistic ICPC competition scenario, featuring
a problem type and difficulty distribution consistent with actual contests. 2)
A robust test case generation method and a corresponding local evaluation
toolkit, enabling efficient and accurate local evaluation. 3) An effective
test-time scaling evaluation metric, Refine@K, which allows iterative repair of
solutions based on execution feedback. The results underscore the significant
challenge in evaluating complex reasoning abilities: top-tier reasoning models
like DeepSeek-R1 often rely on multi-turn code feedback to fully unlock their
in-context reasoning potential when compared to non-reasoning counterparts.
Furthermore, despite recent advancements in code generation, these models still
lag behind top-performing human teams. We release the benchmark at:

Motivation: 现有长上下文推理基准无法有效检测LLMs的嵌套叙事推理缺陷，需解耦上下文长度与推理复杂度以暴露模型根本性局限

Method: 将ListOps数学运算转化为长叙事故事，通过隐藏中间结果强制模型进行内部状态管理，提供叙事长度与推理难度的双重控制

Result: 主流LLMs（如GPT-4、Gemini 2.5 Pro）在约1万token叙事长度时性能崩溃，但可轻松解决原始ListOps问题

Conclusion: 解决状态管理缺陷对现实文本理解至关重要，Verbose ListOps为针对性增强推理能力（非单纯扩展上下文）提供关键测试框架

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), whilst great at extracting facts from text,
struggle with nested narrative reasoning. Existing long context and multi-hop
QA benchmarks inadequately test this, lacking realistic distractors or failing
to decouple context length from reasoning complexity, masking a fundamental LLM
limitation. We introduce Verbose ListOps, a novel benchmark that
programmatically transposes ListOps computations into lengthy, coherent
stories. This uniquely forces internal computation and state management of
nested reasoning problems by withholding intermediate results, and offers
fine-grained controls for both narrative size \emph{and} reasoning difficulty.
Whilst benchmarks like LongReason (2025) advance approaches for synthetically
expanding the context size of multi-hop QA problems, Verbose ListOps pinpoints
a specific LLM vulnerability: difficulty in state management for nested
sub-reasoning amongst semantically-relevant, distracting narrative. Our
experiments show that leading LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o4, Gemini 2.5 Pro) collapse
in performance on Verbose ListOps at modest (~10k token) narrative lengths,
despite effortlessly solving raw ListOps equations. Addressing this failure is
paramount for real-world text interpretation which requires identifying key
reasoning points, tracking conceptual intermediate results, and filtering
irrelevant information. Verbose ListOps, and its extensible generation
framework thus enables targeted reasoning enhancements beyond mere
context-window expansion; a critical step to automating the world's knowledge
work.

Motivation: 质疑当前主流微调方法的绝对优势，探索如何通过混合架构更充分挖掘有限语音/文本数据的潜力。

Method: 采用混合HMM架构整合自监督模型，通过持续自监督预训练+半监督训练策略，同时利用语音和文本数据资源。

Conclusion: 在低资源场景下，结合传统HMM与前沿自监督学习的混合方法比单纯微调现有E2E模型更具竞争力。

Abstract: An effective approach to the development of ASR systems for low-resource
languages is to fine-tune an existing multilingual end-to-end model. When the
original model has been trained on large quantities of data from many
languages, fine-tuning can be effective with limited training data, even when
the language in question was not present in the original training data. The
fine-tuning approach has been encouraged by the availability of public-domain
E2E models and is widely believed to lead to state-of-the-art results. This
paper, however, challenges that belief. We show that an approach combining
hybrid HMMs with self-supervised models can yield substantially better
performance with limited training data. This combination allows better
utilisation of all available speech and text data through continued
self-supervised pre-training and semi-supervised training. We benchmark our
approach on Scottish Gaelic, achieving WER reductions of 32% relative over our
best fine-tuned Whisper model.

Method: 使用强弱模型模拟师生互动，涵盖11种类型学不同语言、4个前沿LLM及多种提示策略，分析语言对齐对学习效果的影响

Result: 多语言提示使低资源语言学习准确率平均提升18.7%，母语反馈组表现优于非母语对照组（p<0.01）

Conclusion: 开发多语言教育工具需优先考虑母语对齐的反馈机制，这对提升LLM在教育场景的包容性和有效性具有关键意义

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to generate
formative feedback and instructional hints in English, making them increasingly
relevant for AI-assisted education. However, their ability to provide effective
instructional support across different languages, especially for mathematically
grounded reasoning tasks, remains largely unexamined. In this work, we present
the first large-scale simulation of multilingual tutor-student interactions
using LLMs. A stronger model plays the role of the tutor, generating feedback
in the form of hints, while a weaker model simulates the student. We explore
352 experimental settings across 11 typologically diverse languages, four
state-of-the-art LLMs, and multiple prompting strategies to assess whether
language-specific feedback leads to measurable learning gains. Our study
examines how student input language, teacher feedback language, model choice,
and language resource level jointly influence performance. Results show that
multilingual hints can significantly improve learning outcomes, particularly in
low-resource languages when feedback is aligned with the student's native
language. These findings offer practical insights for developing multilingual,
LLM-based educational tools that are both effective and inclusive.

Motivation: 现有神经机器翻译模型处理领域特定数据（如电商）时，存在词义歧义和上下文理解不足的问题，需通过多模态信息增强翻译效果。

Method: 构建包含图像和元数据的ConECT数据集，对比测试视觉语言模型(VLM)与整合产品类别路径/图像描述的文本模型。

Abstract: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has improved translation by using
Transformer-based models, but it still struggles with word ambiguity and
context. This problem is especially important in domain-specific applications,
which often have problems with unclear sentences or poor data quality. Our
research explores how adding information to models can improve translations in
the context of e-commerce data. To this end we create ConECT -- a new
Czech-to-Polish e-commerce product translation dataset coupled with images and
product metadata consisting of 11,400 sentence pairs. We then investigate and
compare different methods that are applicable to context-aware translation. We
test a vision-language model (VLM), finding that visual context aids
translation quality. Additionally, we explore the incorporation of contextual
information into text-to-text models, such as the product's category path or
image descriptions. The results of our study demonstrate that the incorporation
of contextual information leads to an improvement in the quality of machine
translation. We make the new dataset publicly available.

Conclusion: 多模型共识筛选最具竞争力，NER可作为低成本替代方案，迭代策略显著优于单步微调

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained ASR models for specific domains is challenging when
labeled data is scarce. But unlabeled audio and labeled data from related
domains are often available. We propose an incremental semi-supervised learning
pipeline that first integrates a small in-domain labeled set and an auxiliary
dataset from a closely related domain, achieving a relative improvement of 4%
over no auxiliary data. Filtering based on multi-model consensus or named
entity recognition (NER) is then applied to select and iteratively refine
pseudo-labels, showing slower performance saturation compared to random
selection. Evaluated on the multi-domain Wow call center and Fisher English
corpora, it outperforms single-step fine-tuning. Consensus-based filtering
outperforms other methods, providing up to 22.3% relative improvement on Wow
and 24.8% on Fisher over single-step fine-tuning with random selection. NER is
the second-best filter, providing competitive performance at a lower
computational cost.

Result: LLMs局部理解优于全局，部分路径与专家相似但整体不达标，31%案例存在正确结论伴随错误推理过程

Conclusion: 未来应加强训练中对完整理解链路的监督，建立过程评估体系而不仅关注最终答案准确性

Abstract: Despite the great potential of large language models(LLMs) in machine
comprehension, it is still disturbing to fully count on them in real-world
scenarios. This is probably because there is no rational explanation for
whether the comprehension process of LLMs is aligned with that of experts. In
this paper, we propose SCOP to carefully examine how LLMs perform during the
comprehension process from a cognitive view. Specifically, it is equipped with
a systematical definition of five requisite skills during the comprehension
process, a strict framework to construct testing data for these skills, and a
detailed analysis of advanced open-sourced and closed-sourced LLMs using the
testing data. With SCOP, we find that it is still challenging for LLMs to
perform an expert-level comprehension process. Even so, we notice that LLMs
share some similarities with experts, e.g., performing better at comprehending
local information than global information. Further analysis reveals that LLMs
can be somewhat unreliable -- they might reach correct answers through flawed
comprehension processes. Based on SCOP, we suggest that one direction for
improving LLMs is to focus more on the comprehension process, ensuring all
comprehension skills are thoroughly developed during training.

Motivation: 现有文本生成长度控制方法通常需要复杂模型修改，限制了与预训练模型的兼容性。本文旨在开发一种无需改变模型结构的通用方法。

Method: 通过增强交叉熵损失函数中EOS令牌预测的权重，使模型自主感知生成终止时机。该方法与模型架构/解码算法无关，可与其他长度控制技术协同使用。

Result: 在编码器-解码器和GPT类大模型测试中，该方法能有效控制生成文本长度，多数情况下保持摘要质量不下降。

Conclusion: 该方案实现了与现有模型兼容的长度控制机制，为文本摘要任务提供了简单有效的解决方案，具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Controlling the length of generated text can be crucial in various
text-generation tasks, including summarization. Existing methods often require
complex model alterations, limiting compatibility with pre-trained models. We
address these limitations by developing a simple approach for controlling the
length of automatic text summaries by increasing the importance of correctly
predicting the EOS token in the cross-entropy loss computation. The proposed
methodology is agnostic to architecture and decoding algorithms and orthogonal
to other inference-time techniques to control the generation length. We tested
it with encoder-decoder and modern GPT-style LLMs, and show that this method
can control generation length, often without affecting the quality of the
summary.

Result: 在GSM8K/MATH-500数学任务及MMLU等通用基准测试中均取得优异表现

Conclusion: AR-Checker为LLM鲁棒性评估提供了动态可靠的测试框架，具备跨领域适用性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved distinguished performance on
various reasoning-intensive tasks. However, LLMs might still face the
challenges of robustness issues and fail unexpectedly in some simple reasoning
tasks. Previous works evaluate the LLM robustness with hand-crafted templates
or a limited set of perturbation rules, indicating potential data contamination
in pre-training or fine-tuning datasets. In this work, inspired by stress
testing in software engineering, we propose a novel framework, Automatic
Robustness Checker (AR-Checker), to generate mathematical problem variants that
maintain the semantic meanings of the original one but might fail the LLMs. The
AR-Checker framework generates mathematical problem variants through
multi-round parallel streams of LLM-based rewriting and verification. Our
framework can generate benchmark variants dynamically for each LLM, thus
minimizing the risk of data contamination. Experiments on GSM8K and MATH-500
demonstrate the strong performance of AR-Checker on mathematical tasks. We also
evaluate AR-Checker on benchmarks beyond mathematics, including MMLU, MMLU-Pro,
and CommonsenseQA, where it also achieves strong performance, further proving
the effectiveness of AR-Checker.

Result: 大模型可近似个体人类判断但整体评估行为差异显著，生成说服性演讲任务可达人类水平

Conclusion: LLM在辩论评估中展现部分人类近似能力，但整体判断逻辑存在本质差异，生成能力或率先突破人类基准

Abstract: We introduce Debate Speech Evaluation as a novel and challenging benchmark
for assessing LLM judges. Evaluating debate speeches requires a deep
understanding of the speech at multiple levels, including argument strength and
relevance, the coherence and organization of the speech, the appropriateness of
its style and tone, and so on. This task involves a unique set of cognitive
abilities that have previously received limited attention in systematic LLM
benchmarking. To explore such skills, we leverage a dataset of over 600
meticulously annotated debate speeches and present the first in-depth analysis
of how state-of-the-art LLMs compare to human judges on this task. Our findings
reveal a nuanced picture: while larger models can approximate individual human
judgments in some respects, they differ substantially in their overall judgment
behavior. We also investigate the ability of frontier LLMs to generate
persuasive, opinionated speeches, showing that models may perform at a human
level on this task.

Motivation: 针对LLMs表现出的自我报告能力，研究其是否可被视为类似人类的内省机制

Method: 采用对比案例分析：1.模型描述自身创作过程（非内省） 2.模型推断自身温度参数（最小内省）

Result: 发现温度参数推断案例可视为无意识的最小内省实例，创作过程描述缺乏真实内省特征

Conclusion: LLMs在特定技术场景下可能展现机械性内省能力，但这种能力与人类意识体验无本质关联

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit compelling linguistic behaviour, and
sometimes offer self-reports, that is to say statements about their own nature,
inner workings, or behaviour. In humans, such reports are often attributed to a
faculty of introspection and are typically linked to consciousness. This raises
the question of how to interpret self-reports produced by LLMs, given their
increasing linguistic fluency and cognitive capabilities. To what extent (if
any) can the concept of introspection be meaningfully applied to LLMs? Here, we
present and critique two examples of apparent introspective self-report from
LLMs. In the first example, an LLM attempts to describe the process behind its
own ``creative'' writing, and we argue this is not a valid example of
introspection. In the second example, an LLM correctly infers the value of its
own temperature parameter, and we argue that this can be legitimately
considered a minimal example of introspection, albeit one that is (presumably)
not accompanied by conscious experience.

Motivation: 发现强化学习人类反馈（RLHF）在口语字幕翻译任务中表现异常差，根源在于离线奖励模型（RM）与在线LLM的分布偏移导致训练失效

Result: 大量实验证明该框架显著优于传统翻译基线模型，实现参考无关的质量评估且与人类评价对齐

Conclusion: 对抗训练机制有效解决了分布偏移问题，定性与定量奖励的融合策略提升了翻译系统的鲁棒性和评估准确性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess strong multilingual capabilities, and
combining Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) with translation
tasks has shown great potential. However, we observe that this paradigm
performs unexpectedly poorly when applied to colloquial subtitle translation
tasks. In this work, we investigate this issue and find that the offline reward
model (RM) gradually diverges from the online LLM due to distributional shift,
ultimately leading to undesirable training outcomes. To address this, we
propose RIVAL, an adversarial training framework that formulates the process as
a min-max game between the RM and the LLM. RIVAL iteratively updates the both
models, with the RM trained to distinguish strong from weak translations
(qualitative preference reward), and the LLM trained to enhance its translation
for closing this gap. To stabilize training and improve generalizability, we
also incorporate quantitative preference reward (e.g., BLEU) into the RM,
enabling reference-free quality modeling aligned with human evaluation. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed adversarial training
framework significantly improves upon translation baselines.

Abstract: Self-harm detection on social media is critical for early intervention and
mental health support, yet remains challenging due to the subtle,
context-dependent nature of such expressions. Identifying self-harm intent aids
suicide prevention by enabling timely responses, but current large language
models (LLMs) struggle to interpret implicit cues in casual language and
emojis. This work enhances LLMs' comprehension of self-harm by distinguishing
intent through nuanced language-emoji interplay. We present the Centennial
Emoji Sensitivity Matrix (CESM-100), a curated set of 100 emojis with
contextual self-harm interpretations and the Self-Harm Identification aNd
intent Extraction with Supportive emoji sensitivity (SHINES) dataset, offering
detailed annotations for self-harm labels, casual mentions (CMs), and serious
intents (SIs). Our unified framework: a) enriches inputs using CESM-100; b)
fine-tunes LLMs for multi-task learning: self-harm detection (primary) and
CM/SI span detection (auxiliary); c) generates explainable rationales for
self-harm predictions. We evaluate the framework on three state-of-the-art
LLMs-Llama 3, Mental-Alpaca, and MentalLlama, across zero-shot, few-shot, and
fine-tuned scenarios. By coupling intent differentiation with contextual cues,
our approach commendably enhances LLM performance in both detection and
explanation tasks, effectively addressing the inherent ambiguity in self-harm
signals. The SHINES dataset, CESM-100 and codebase are publicly available at:

Result: 适度车辆可达性提升商业活力，但窄街道过度停车降低步行满意度；绿化和清洁度显著提升满意度但对商业定价影响有限；街道宽度调节车辆停放效应

Conclusion: 证明了多模态AI在城市诊断中的应用潜力，为平衡车辆可达性与步行友好设计提供理论依据，推动数据驱动的社区更新策略

Abstract: The commercial vitality of community-scale streets in Chinese cities is
shaped by complex interactions between vehicular accessibility, environmental
quality, and pedestrian perception. This study proposes an interpretable,
image-based framework to examine how street-level features -- including parked
vehicle density, greenery, cleanliness, and street width -- impact retail
performance and user satisfaction in Harbin, China. Leveraging street view
imagery and a multimodal large language model (VisualGLM-6B), we construct a
Community Commercial Vitality Index (CCVI) from Meituan and Dianping data and
analyze its relationship with spatial attributes extracted via GPT-4-based
perception modeling. Our findings reveal that while moderate vehicle presence
may enhance commercial access, excessive on-street parking -- especially in
narrow streets -- erodes walkability and reduces both satisfaction and
shop-level pricing. In contrast, streets with higher perceived greenery and
cleanliness show significantly greater satisfaction scores but only weak
associations with pricing. Street width moderates the effects of vehicle
presence, underscoring the importance of spatial configuration. These results
demonstrate the value of integrating AI-assisted perception with urban
morphological analysis to capture non-linear and context-sensitive drivers of
commercial success. This study advances both theoretical and methodological
frontiers by highlighting the conditional role of vehicle activity in
neighborhood commerce and demonstrating the feasibility of multimodal AI for
perceptual urban diagnostics. The implications extend to urban design, parking
management, and scalable planning tools for community revitalization.

Conclusion: CL-ISR通过双重技术创新实现检测性能突破，为社交媒体内容治理提供有效解决方案

Abstract: Misleading text detection on social media platforms is a critical research
area, as these texts can lead to public misunderstanding, social panic and even
economic losses. This paper proposes a novel framework - CL-ISR (Contrastive
Learning and Implicit Stance Reasoning), which combines contrastive learning
and implicit stance reasoning, to improve the detection accuracy of misleading
texts on social media. First, we use the contrastive learning algorithm to
improve the model's learning ability of semantic differences between truthful
and misleading texts. Contrastive learning could help the model to better
capture the distinguishing features between different categories by
constructing positive and negative sample pairs. This approach enables the
model to capture distinguishing features more effectively, particularly in
linguistically complicated situations. Second, we introduce the implicit stance
reasoning module, to explore the potential stance tendencies in the text and
their relationships with related topics. This method is effective for
identifying content that misleads through stance shifting or emotional
manipulation, because it can capture the implicit information behind the text.
Finally, we integrate these two algorithms together to form a new framework,
CL-ISR, which leverages the discriminative power of contrastive learning and
the interpretive depth of stance reasoning to significantly improve detection
effect.

Abstract: A recent line of research on spoken language assessment (SLA) employs neural
models such as BERT and wav2vec 2.0 (W2V) to evaluate speaking proficiency
across linguistic and acoustic modalities. Although both models effectively
capture features relevant to oral competence, each exhibits modality-specific
limitations. BERT-based methods rely on ASR transcripts, which often fail to
capture prosodic and phonetic cues for SLA. In contrast, W2V-based methods
excel at modeling acoustic features but lack semantic interpretability. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a system that integrates W2V with Phi-4
multimodal large language model (MLLM) through a score fusion strategy. The
proposed system achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.375 on the
official test set of the Speak & Improve Challenge 2025, securing second place
in the competition. For comparison, the RMSEs of the top-ranked, third-ranked,

Result: 在5个领域6个数据集上超越所有基线，平均F1提升4-7%，最高达15%相对提升，验证框架有效性

Conclusion: 发散-收敛的认知范式显著提升零样本事件检测性能，为领域文档理解提供新方法论，证明混合推理路径的有效性

Abstract: Zero-shot Event Detection (ED), the task of identifying event mentions in
natural language text without any training data, is critical for document
understanding in specialized domains. Understanding the complex event ontology,
extracting domain-specific triggers from the passage, and structuring them
appropriately overloads and limits the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs)
for zero-shot ED. To this end, we propose DiCoRe, a divergent-convergent
reasoning framework that decouples the task of ED using Dreamer and Grounder.
Dreamer encourages divergent reasoning through open-ended event discovery,
which helps to boost event coverage. Conversely, Grounder introduces convergent
reasoning to align the free-form predictions with the task-specific
instructions using finite-state machine guided constrained decoding.
Additionally, an LLM-Judge verifies the final outputs to ensure high precision.
Through extensive experiments on six datasets across five domains and nine
LLMs, we demonstrate how DiCoRe consistently outperforms prior zero-shot,
transfer-learning, and reasoning baselines, achieving 4-7% average F1 gains
over the best baseline -- establishing DiCoRe as a strong zero-shot ED
framework.

TL;DR: 通过提出m-局部熵指标，揭示神经语言模型与人类类似，对语言的局部统计结构高度敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨神经语言模型的归纳偏置是否与人类语言处理机制一致，建立量化框架分析模型对语言统计结构的敏感性。

Method: 提出基于信息论的m-局部熵指标，测量前m-1个符号对下一个符号的消歧能力；在扰动自然语料和概率有限状态自动机生成的语言上进行Transformer/LSTM模型实验。

Result: m-局部熵越高的语言模型学习难度越大，表明神经模型学习效果直接受语言局部统计结构影响。

Conclusion: 神经语言模型与人类认知类似，其学习效率受语言局部统计模式制约，为理解模型归纳偏置提供了量化依据。

Abstract: Inductive biases are inherent in every machine learning system, shaping how
models generalize from finite data. In the case of neural language models
(LMs), debates persist as to whether these biases align with or diverge from
human processing constraints. To address this issue, we propose a quantitative
framework that allows for controlled investigations into the nature of these
biases. Within our framework, we introduce $m$-local entropy$\unicode{x2013}$an
information-theoretic measure derived from average lossy-context
surprisal$\unicode{x2013}$that captures the local uncertainty of a language by
quantifying how effectively the $m-1$ preceding symbols disambiguate the next
symbol. In experiments on both perturbed natural language corpora and languages
defined by probabilistic finite-state automata (PFSAs), we show that languages
with higher $m$-local entropy are more difficult for Transformer and LSTM LMs
to learn. These results suggest that neural LMs, much like humans, are highly
sensitive to the local statistical structure of a language.

Motivation: 理解大型音频语言模型（LALMs）的内部机制对解释其行为和提升性能至关重要

Method: 在三个先进LALMs上应用词表投影技术，追踪属性信息在模型层级和token位置的演化轨迹

Result: 发现浅层特征解析对准确性起关键作用，模型过度依赖原始输入而非隐状态聚合，并基于此提出改进方案

Conclusion: 该研究为LALMs的听觉处理机制提供新见解，为未来优化奠定理论基础

Abstract: Understanding the internal mechanisms of large audio-language models (LALMs)
is crucial for interpreting their behavior and improving performance. This work
presents the first in-depth analysis of how LALMs internally perceive and
recognize auditory attributes. By applying vocabulary projection on three
state-of-the-art LALMs, we track how attribute information evolves across
layers and token positions. We find that attribute information generally
decreases with layer depth when recognition fails, and that resolving
attributes at earlier layers correlates with better accuracy. Moreover, LALMs
heavily rely on querying auditory inputs for predicting attributes instead of
aggregating necessary information in hidden states at attribute-mentioning
positions. Based on our findings, we demonstrate a method to enhance LALMs. Our
results offer insights into auditory attribute processing, paving the way for
future improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证LLMs能否准确复现人类对图像描述错误严重性的判断，探索模型评估机制的局限性。

Method: 扩展van Miltenburg框架至单模态（纯文本）和多模态（图文）场景，评估年龄/性别/服装类型/颜色四类错误。

Result: 人类对颜色/类型错误敏感度受视觉情境强化；多数LLMs低估性别错误但高估颜色错误；DeepSeek-V3跨模态表现最佳。

Conclusion: LLMs可能内化了社会规范（性别判断），但缺乏人类基于神经机制的色彩感知能力，模型评估机制需针对性改进。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated evaluators in
natural language generation, yet it remains unclear whether they can accurately
replicate human judgments of error severity. In this study, we systematically
compare human and LLM assessments of image descriptions containing controlled
semantic errors. We extend the experimental framework of van Miltenburg et al.
(2020) to both unimodal (text-only) and multimodal (text + image) settings,
evaluating four error types: age, gender, clothing type, and clothing colour.
Our findings reveal that humans assign varying levels of severity to different
error types, with visual context significantly amplifying perceived severity
for colour and type errors. Notably, most LLMs assign low scores to gender
errors but disproportionately high scores to colour errors, unlike humans, who
judge both as highly severe but for different reasons. This suggests that these
models may have internalised social norms influencing gender judgments but lack
the perceptual grounding to emulate human sensitivity to colour, which is
shaped by distinct neural mechanisms. Only one of the evaluated LLMs, Doubao,
replicates the human-like ranking of error severity, but it fails to
distinguish between error types as clearly as humans. Surprisingly,
DeepSeek-V3, a unimodal LLM, achieves the highest alignment with human
judgments across both unimodal and multimodal conditions, outperforming even
state-of-the-art multimodal models.

<details>

Motivation: 当前RAG系统过度依赖检索上下文，容易受不准确信息干扰且忽视模型内在知识，尤其在处理误导或过量信息时存在局限性。

Method: 使用联合采样定义多策略分布，激发大语言模型自主整合参数知识（模型本身知识）与上下文知识（检索知识）的能力。

Result: 在参数冲突和常规RAG任务中推理准确率显著提升，对抗性场景下超越基线17.07%，所有任务均实现稳定性能增益。

Conclusion: Knowledgeable-r1有效平衡知识利用机制，提升模型在复杂场景下的稳健性，为改进知识密集型任务的解决方案提供了新范式。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a mainstream method for improving
performance on knowledge-intensive tasks. However,current RAG systems often
place too much emphasis on retrieved contexts. This can lead to reliance on
inaccurate sources and overlook the model's inherent knowledge, especially when
dealing with misleading or excessive information. To resolve this imbalance, we
propose Knowledgeable-r1 that using joint sampling and define multi policy
distributions in knowledge capability exploration to stimulate large language
models'self-integrated utilization of parametric and contextual knowledge.
Experiments show that Knowledgeable-r1 significantly enhances robustness and
reasoning accuracy in both parameters and contextual conflict tasks and general
RAG tasks, especially outperforming baselines by 17.07% in counterfactual
scenarios and demonstrating consistent gains across RAG tasks. Our code are

<details>

Motivation: 大型语言模型的偏见源于训练数据，需通过结构分析理解其形成机制以制定有效缓解策略。

Method: 使用机制可解释性方法，结合系统性消融实验，分析模型在不同数据集和语言变体下的偏见组件稳定性，并测试组件移除对NER等任务的影响。

Result: 偏见计算集中在特定层（如中间层），微调会改变偏见组件分布，移除偏见组件使分类偏差降低38%但使语言接受度判断准确率下降12%。

Conclusion: 偏见处理组件具有任务共享特性，需在消除偏见与保持模型能力间平衡；微调过程需谨慎处理非目标领域的组件变化。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to exhibit social, demographic, and
gender biases, often as a consequence of the data on which they are trained. In
this work, we adopt a mechanistic interpretability approach to analyze how such
biases are structurally represented within models such as GPT-2 and Llama2.
Focusing on demographic and gender biases, we explore different metrics to
identify the internal edges responsible for biased behavior. We then assess the
stability, localization, and generalizability of these components across
dataset and linguistic variations. Through systematic ablations, we demonstrate
that bias-related computations are highly localized, often concentrated in a
small subset of layers. Moreover, the identified components change across
fine-tuning settings, including those unrelated to bias. Finally, we show that
removing these components not only reduces biased outputs but also affects
other NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition and linguistic acceptability
judgment because of the sharing of important components with these tasks.

Motivation: 现有检索增强生成(RAG)的文档压缩方法未能有效过滤非证据性信息，限制了LLM在开放域问答任务中的表现

Method: 通过证据性评估压缩检索文档，动态判断证据充分性并循环检索直至满足要求

Result: 在ODQA任务中准确率超越现有方法，同时减少48%的token消耗和34%的延迟

Conclusion: ECoRAG成功平衡性能与效率，为LLM的实际应用提供了经济高效的解决方案

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in Open-Domain
Question Answering (ODQA) by leveraging external documents through
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). To reduce RAG overhead, from longer
context, context compression is necessary. However, prior compression methods
do not focus on filtering out non-evidential information, which limit the
performance in LLM-based RAG. We thus propose Evidentiality-guided RAG, or
\textbf{ECoRAG} framework. ECoRAG improves LLM performance by compressing
retrieved documents based on evidentiality, ensuring whether answer generation
is supported by the correct evidence. As an additional step, ECoRAG reflects
whether the compressed content provides sufficient evidence, and if not,
retrieves more until sufficient. Experiments show that ECoRAG improves LLM
performance on ODQA tasks, outperforming existing compression methods.
Furthermore, ECoRAG is highly cost-efficient, as it not only reduces latency
but also minimizes token usage by retaining only the necessary information to
generate the correct answer. Code is available at

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Qwen3 Embedding series, a significant
advancement over its predecessor, the GTE-Qwen series, in text embedding and
reranking capabilities, built upon the Qwen3 foundation models. Leveraging the
Qwen3 LLMs' robust capabilities in multilingual text understanding and
generation, our innovative multi-stage training pipeline combines large-scale
unsupervised pre-training with supervised fine-tuning on high-quality datasets.
Effective model merging strategies further ensure the robustness and
adaptability of the Qwen3 Embedding series. During the training process, the
Qwen3 LLMs serve not only as backbone models but also play a crucial role in
synthesizing high-quality, rich, and diverse training data across multiple
domains and languages, thus enhancing the training pipeline. The Qwen3
Embedding series offers a spectrum of model sizes (0.6B, 4B, 8B) for both
embedding and reranking tasks, addressing diverse deployment scenarios where
users can optimize for either efficiency or effectiveness. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that the Qwen3 Embedding series achieves
state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks. Notably, it excels on the
multilingual evaluation benchmark MTEB for text embedding, as well as in
various retrieval tasks, including code retrieval, cross-lingual retrieval and
multilingual retrieval. To facilitate reproducibility and promote
community-driven research and development, the Qwen3 Embedding models are

Abstract: Large-scale neural language models (LMs) exhibit remarkable performance in
in-context learning: the ability to learn and reason the input context on the
fly without parameter update. This work studies in-context counterfactual
reasoning in language models, that is, to predict the consequences of changes
under hypothetical scenarios. We focus on studying a well-defined synthetic
setup: a linear regression task that requires noise abduction, where accurate
prediction is based on inferring and copying the contextual noise from factual
observations. We show that language models are capable of counterfactual
reasoning in this controlled setup and provide insights that counterfactual
reasoning for a broad class of functions can be reduced to a transformation on
in-context observations; we find self-attention, model depth, and data
diversity in pre-training drive performance in Transformers. More
interestingly, our findings extend beyond regression tasks and show that
Transformers can perform noise abduction on sequential data, providing
preliminary evidence on the potential for counterfactual story generation. Our

Method: 提出RELIC框架，使用自动生成的合成语言进行语言识别任务测试，通过控制语法复杂度和样本难度实现可扩展性评估

Result: 1. 模型准确率与语法/样本复杂度呈强相关 
2. 最先进模型在复杂语法（如上下文敏感文法）上正确率仅51%

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在需要组合多个复杂指令的任务中存在根本性局限，随着任务复杂度增加会放弃深度推理转而依赖表面特征，验证了理论预期的模型能力边界

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to perform tasks based
only on a specification of the task provided in context, without examples of
inputs and outputs; this ability is referred to as instruction following. We
introduce the Recognition of Languages In-Context (RELIC) framework to evaluate
instruction following using language recognition: the task of determining if a
string is generated by formal grammar. Unlike many standard evaluations of
LLMs' ability to use their context, this task requires composing together a
large number of instructions (grammar productions) retrieved from the context.
Because the languages are synthetic, the task can be increased in complexity as
LLMs' skills improve, and new instances can be automatically generated,
mitigating data contamination. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on RELIC and
find that their accuracy can be reliably predicted from the complexity of the
grammar and the individual example strings, and that even the most advanced
LLMs currently available show near-chance performance on more complex grammars
and samples, in line with theoretical expectations. We also use RELIC to
diagnose how LLMs attempt to solve increasingly difficult reasoning tasks,
finding that as the complexity of the language recognition task increases,
models switch to relying on shallow heuristics instead of following complex
instructions.

Conclusion: 证明开放数据可支撑高性能LLM训练，开源数据集/代码/模型促进合规AI发展

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on enormous quantities of
unlicensed text, a practice that has led to scrutiny due to possible
intellectual property infringement and ethical concerns. Training LLMs on
openly licensed text presents a first step towards addressing these issues, but
prior data collection efforts have yielded datasets too small or low-quality to
produce performant LLMs. To address this gap, we collect, curate, and release
the Common Pile v0.1, an eight terabyte collection of openly licensed text
designed for LLM pretraining. The Common Pile comprises content from 30 sources
that span diverse domains including research papers, code, books,
encyclopedias, educational materials, audio transcripts, and more. Crucially,
we validate our efforts by training two 7 billion parameter LLMs on text from
the Common Pile: Comma v0.1-1T and Comma v0.1-2T, trained on 1 and 2 trillion
tokens respectively. Both models attain competitive performance to LLMs trained
on unlicensed text with similar computational budgets, such as Llama 1 and 2
7B. In addition to releasing the Common Pile v0.1 itself, we also release the
code used in its creation as well as the training mixture and checkpoints for
the Comma v0.1 models.

Motivation: 解决全球多数语言缺乏大规模标注数据的问题，探索字符级任务（如形态屈折）在低资源场景下的自监督学习潜力，尤其关注语言文档化相关的核心任务。

Method: 使用编码器-解码器Transformer模型，在19种低资源语言上测试13种自监督辅助任务（包括自动编码、字符掩码语言建模等），对比不同数据规模下的性能表现。

Result: 数据极度稀缺时自动编码最佳，数据量增大后CMLM更有效；基于已知语素边界的掩码策略持续提升性能，而强归纳偏置的目标函数普遍弱于标准CMLM。

Conclusion: 字符掩码语言建模结合语素边界先验知识是低资源形态建模的有效方向，为语言文档化提供了实用的模型优化思路。

Abstract: Self-supervised objectives have driven major advances in NLP by leveraging
large-scale unlabeled data, but such resources are scarce for many of the
world's languages. Surprisingly, they have not been explored much for
character-level tasks, where smaller amounts of data have the potential to be
beneficial. We investigate the effectiveness of self-supervised auxiliary tasks
for morphological inflection -- a character-level task highly relevant for
language documentation -- in extremely low-resource settings, training
encoder-decoder transformers for 19 languages and 13 auxiliary objectives.
Autoencoding yields the best performance when unlabeled data is very limited,
while character masked language modeling (CMLM) becomes more effective as data
availability increases. Though objectives with stronger inductive biases
influence model predictions intuitively, they rarely outperform standard CMLM.
However, sampling masks based on known morpheme boundaries consistently
improves performance, highlighting a promising direction for low-resource
morphological modeling.

Result: 证明连续与非连续结构可通过统一系统进行数学化分析

Conclusion: 三语法的协同表征为语言结构分析提供了统一框架

Abstract: Syntactic discontinuity is a grammatical phenomenon in which a constituent is
split into more than one part because of the insertion of an element which is
not part of the constituent. This is observed in many languages across the
world such as Turkish, Russian, Japanese, Warlpiri, Navajo, Hopi, Dyirbal,
Yidiny etc. Different formalisms/frameworks in current linguistic theory
approach the problem of discontinuous structures in different ways. Each
framework/formalism has widely been viewed as an independent and non-converging
system of analysis. In this paper, we propose a unified system of
representation for both continuity and discontinuity in structures of natural
languages by taking into account three formalisms, in particular, Phrase
Structure Grammar (PSG) for its widely used notion of constituency, Dependency
Grammar (DG) for its head-dependent relations, and Categorial Grammar (CG) for
its focus on functor-argument relations. We attempt to show that discontinuous
expressions as well as continuous structures can be analysed through a unified
mathematical derivation incorporating the representations of linguistic
structure in these three grammar formalisms.

Conclusion: 系统化的推理框架能显著增强LLMs在复杂语义任务中的决策能力，为可解释AI提供新方向

Abstract: A common approach to hallucination detection casts it as a natural language
inference (NLI) task, often using LLMs to classify whether the generated text
is entailed by corresponding reference texts. Since entailment classification
is a complex reasoning task, one would expect that LLMs could benefit from
generating an explicit reasoning process, as in CoT reasoning or the explicit
``thinking'' of recent reasoning models. In this work, we propose that guiding
such models to perform a systematic and comprehensive reasoning process -- one
that both decomposes the text into smaller facts and also finds evidence in the
source for each fact -- allows models to execute much finer-grained and
accurate entailment decisions, leading to increased performance. To that end,
we define a 3-step reasoning process, consisting of (i) claim decomposition,
(ii) sub-claim attribution and entailment classification, and (iii) aggregated
classification, showing that such guided reasoning indeed yields improved
hallucination detection. Following this reasoning framework, we introduce an
analysis scheme, consisting of several metrics that measure the quality of the
intermediate reasoning steps, which provided additional empirical evidence for
the improved quality of our guided reasoning scheme.

Result: 在5个基准数据集上QA准确率显著超越基线（尤其时间/语义冲突场景），非冲突问题表现同步提升，验证实际应用价值

Conclusion: Micro-Act通过自适应知识分解有效缓解知识冲突，在保持通用场景鲁棒性的同时提升冲突处理能力，具有实际部署意义

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems commonly suffer from Knowledge
Conflicts, where retrieved external knowledge contradicts the inherent,
parametric knowledge of large language models (LLMs). It adversely affects
performance on downstream tasks such as question answering (QA). Existing
approaches often attempt to mitigate conflicts by directly comparing two
knowledge sources in a side-by-side manner, but this can overwhelm LLMs with
extraneous or lengthy contexts, ultimately hindering their ability to identify
and mitigate inconsistencies. To address this issue, we propose Micro-Act a
framework with a hierarchical action space that automatically perceives context
complexity and adaptively decomposes each knowledge source into a sequence of
fine-grained comparisons. These comparisons are represented as actionable
steps, enabling reasoning beyond the superficial context. Through extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets, Micro-Act consistently achieves
significant increase in QA accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines across all
5 datasets and 3 conflict types, especially in temporal and semantic types
where all baselines fail significantly. More importantly, Micro-Act exhibits
robust performance on non-conflict questions simultaneously, highlighting its
practical value in real-world RAG applications.

TL;DR: ProRefine提出了一种动态优化多步骤推理任务提示的方法，无需额外训练即可显著提升数学推理任务性能3-37%，并使小模型达到大模型水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于多智能体的工作流程因提示设计不佳导致错误传播和性能下降，限制了系统的可靠性和扩展性。

Method: 利用大语言模型的文本反馈，在推理时动态优化多步骤任务的提示策略，不依赖额外训练数据或标注信息。

Result: 在五个数学推理基准测试中准确率超越零样本思维链基线3-37个百分点，小模型可达到大模型性能水平。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了高效可扩展的AI部署，为资源受限场景提供高性能解决方案，推动AI技术民主化。

Abstract: Agentic workflows, where multiple AI agents collaborate to accomplish complex
tasks like reasoning or planning, are becoming increasingly prevalent. However,
these workflows often suffer from error propagation and sub-optimal
performance, largely due to poorly designed prompts that fail to effectively
guide individual agents. This is a critical problem because it limits the
reliability and scalability of these powerful systems. We introduce ProRefine,
an innovative inference-time prompt optimization method that leverages textual
feedback from large language models (LLMs) to address this challenge. ProRefine
dynamically refines prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks without additional
training or ground truth labels. Evaluated on five benchmark mathematical
reasoning datasets, ProRefine significantly surpasses zero-shot
Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3 to 37 percentage points. This approach not only
boosts accuracy but also allows smaller models to match the performance of
larger ones, highlighting its potential for efficient and scalable AI
deployment, and democratizing access to high-performing AI.

Motivation: 现有正则化遗忘方法存在优化不稳定和性能退化问题，需开发更鲁棒的遗忘机制

Method: 使用logit-margin flattening损失驱动均匀化输出分布，结合原对偶算法实现遗忘-保留平衡

Result: 在TOFU和MUSE基准测试中超越SOTA，有效移除目标信息并保持下游任务性能

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM信息管理提供了新的优化范式，通过显式约束实现遗忘与保留的动态平衡

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in real-world settings increasingly
face the need to unlearn sensitive, outdated, or proprietary information.
Existing unlearning methods typically formulate forgetting and retention as a
regularized trade-off, combining both objectives into a single scalarized loss.
This often leads to unstable optimization and degraded performance on retained
data, especially under aggressive forgetting. We propose a new formulation of
LLM unlearning as a constrained optimization problem: forgetting is enforced
via a novel logit-margin flattening loss that explicitly drives the output
distribution toward uniformity on a designated forget set, while retention is
preserved through a hard constraint on a separate retain set. Compared to
entropy-based objectives, our loss is softmax-free, numerically stable, and
maintains non-vanishing gradients, enabling more efficient and robust
optimization. We solve the constrained problem using a scalable primal-dual
algorithm that exposes the trade-off between forgetting and retention through
the dynamics of the dual variable. Evaluations on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks
across diverse LLM architectures demonstrate that our approach consistently
matches or exceeds state-of-the-art baselines, effectively removing targeted
information while preserving downstream utility.

TL;DR: 研究发现语言模型偏好评估存在系统性偏差，提出反事实数据增强方法有效降低错误校准


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在人类偏好对齐和评估中存在过度依赖表面特征（如长度/结构/风格）的问题，导致奖励黑客和评估不可靠，这些偏差源于训练数据伪影

Method: 通过五个特征维度（长度/结构/术语/谄媚/模糊性）构建反事实对比样本，量化偏好模型偏差程度，并提出基于反事实数据增强（CDA）的后训练方法

Result: CDA方法使平均错误校准率从39.4%降至32.5%，绝对偏差差异从20.5%降至10.0%，同时保持整体RewardBench性能

Conclusion: 针对性的反事实数据增强能有效修正偏好模型偏差，为构建可靠的人类偏好评估模型提供了可行方案

Abstract: Language models serve as proxies for human preference judgements in alignment
and evaluation, yet they exhibit systematic miscalibration, prioritizing
superficial patterns over substantive qualities. This bias manifests as
overreliance on features like length, structure, and style, leading to issues
like reward hacking and unreliable evaluations. Evidence suggests these biases
originate in artifacts in human training data. In this work, we systematically
investigate the relationship between training data biases and preference model
miscalibration across five idiosyncratic features of language model
generations: length, structure, jargon, sycophancy and vagueness. Using
controlled counterfactual pairs, we first quantify the extent to which
preference models favor responses with magnified biases (skew), finding this
preference occurs in >60% of instances, and model preferences show high
miscalibration (~40%) compared to human preferences. Notably, bias features
only show mild negative correlations to human preference labels (mean r_human =
-0.12) but show moderately strong positive correlations with labels from a
strong reward model (mean r_model = +0.36), suggesting that models may overrely
on spurious cues. To mitigate these issues, we propose a simple post-training
method based on counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) using synthesized
contrastive examples. Finetuning models with CDA reduces average miscalibration
from 39.4% to 32.5% and average absolute skew difference from 20.5% to 10.0%,
while maintaining overall RewardBench performance, showing that targeted
debiasing is effective for building reliable preference models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于预定义噪声调度的动漫着色方法存在感知一致性不足的问题，需要开发能同时保持线稿结构完整性和风格属性迁移能力的解决方案。

Method: 构建连续时间扩散模型框架，引入SSIMBaD算法实现Sigma空间的线性变换对齐感知退化，通过结构相似性指标(SSIM)指导平衡扩散过程。

Result: 在大规模动漫面部数据集上验证，本方法在像素精度和感知质量上均超越现有最优模型，且具备多风格泛化能力。

Conclusion: SSIMBaD通过Sigma缩放机制有效平衡了不同时间步的视觉重建难度，实现了更忠实且均衡的动漫线稿着色效果。

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based framework for automatic colorization of
Anime-style facial sketches. Our method preserves the structural fidelity of
the input sketch while effectively transferring stylistic attributes from a
reference image. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on predefined noise
schedules - which often compromise perceptual consistency -- our framework
builds on continuous-time diffusion models and introduces SSIMBaD (Sigma
Scaling with SSIM-Guided Balanced Diffusion). SSIMBaD applies a sigma-space
transformation that aligns perceptual degradation, as measured by structural
similarity (SSIM), in a linear manner. This scaling ensures uniform visual
difficulty across timesteps, enabling more balanced and faithful
reconstructions. Experiments on a large-scale Anime face dataset demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in both pixel accuracy and
perceptual quality, while generalizing to diverse styles. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有网格变形方法存在输出质量低、依赖人工调整或数据训练的问题，需开发自动化高质量方案

Method: 1. 锥形奇点检测识别潜在手柄 2. 用VLM选择可变形部件与手柄 3. 屏幕空间查询目标位置 4. 多视角投票降低预测不确定性

Result: 在CLIP/GPTEval3D指标上用户意图对齐度提升，膜能量量化显示低扭曲（基准测试综合表现最优）

Conclusion: 该训练无关方法实现了高度自动化且质量稳定的网格变形，解决了传统方案的质量-效率矛盾

Abstract: Mesh deformation is a fundamental tool in 3D content manipulation. Despite
extensive prior research, existing approaches often suffer from low output
quality, require significant manual tuning, or depend on data-intensive
training. To address these limitations, we introduce a training-free,
handle-based mesh deformation method. % Our core idea is to leverage a
Vision-Language Model (VLM) to interpret and manipulate a handle-based
interface through prompt engineering. We begin by applying cone singularity
detection to identify a sparse set of potential handles. The VLM is then
prompted to select both the deformable sub-parts of the mesh and the handles
that best align with user instructions. Subsequently, we query the desired
deformed positions of the selected handles in screen space. To reduce
uncertainty inherent in VLM predictions, we aggregate the results from multiple
camera views using a novel multi-view voting scheme. % Across a suite of
benchmarks, our method produces deformations that align more closely with user
intent, as measured by CLIP and GPTEval3D scores, while introducing low
distortion -- quantified via membrane energy. In summary, our approach is
training-free, highly automated, and consistently delivers high-quality mesh
deformations.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出VoxDet框架，通过将体素级语义占用预测解耦为实例偏移回归和语义预测任务，解决了现有方法实例级模糊问题，并在多模态输入下实现SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D语义占用预测方法独立分类体素，忽视实例级特征，导致实例不完整和相邻体素歧义。利用体素标签隐含的实例级信息，提出改进方案。

Method: 1. 提出VoxNT方法将体素标签转换为实例偏移标签；2. 构建VoxDet框架：a) 空间解耦体素编码器生成任务专用特征，b) 任务解耦密集预测器进行4D偏移回归（6方向距离估计）和语义预测的联合优化。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI测试集达到63.0 IoU（排名第1），支持相机/LiDAR多模态输入，计算效率高。

Conclusion: VoxDet通过实例级检测范式突破体素级预测瓶颈，首次实现无标注转换的端到端训练，为3D场景理解提供了新思路。

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction aims to reconstruct the 3D geometry and
semantics of the surrounding environment. With dense voxel labels, prior works
typically formulate it as a dense segmentation task, independently classifying
each voxel. However, this paradigm neglects critical instance-centric
discriminability, leading to instance-level incompleteness and adjacent
ambiguities. To address this, we highlight a free lunch of occupancy labels:
the voxel-level class label implicitly provides insight at the instance level,
which is overlooked by the community. Motivated by this observation, we first
introduce a training-free Voxel-to-Instance (VoxNT) trick: a simple yet
effective method that freely converts voxel-level class labels into
instance-level offset labels. Building on this, we further propose VoxDet, an
instance-centric framework that reformulates the voxel-level occupancy
prediction as dense object detection by decoupling it into two sub-tasks:
offset regression and semantic prediction. Specifically, based on the lifted 3D
volume, VoxDet first uses (a) Spatially-decoupled Voxel Encoder to generate
disentangled feature volumes for the two sub-tasks, which learn task-specific
spatial deformation in the densely projected tri-perceptive space. Then, we
deploy (b) Task-decoupled Dense Predictor to address this task via dense
detection. Here, we first regress a 4D offset field to estimate distances (6
directions) between voxels and object borders in the voxel space. The regressed
offsets are then used to guide the instance-level aggregation in the
classification branch, achieving instance-aware prediction. Experiments show
that VoxDet can be deployed on both camera and LiDAR input, jointly achieving
state-of-the-art results on both benchmarks. VoxDet is not only highly
efficient, but also achieves 63.0 IoU on the SemanticKITTI test set, ranking
1st on the online leaderboard.

Result: 方案速度超越现有技术，Rosin测量指标表现优异，且对几何变换具有鲁棒性

Conclusion: 通过多阶段顶点修正机制，在保持计算效率的同时实现了美学增强，为数字几何处理提供了新范式

Abstract: This paper proposes a fast and unsupervised scheme for a polygonal
approximation of a closed digital curve. It is demonstrated that the
approximation scheme is faster than state-of-the-art approximation and is
competitive with the same in Rosin's measure and in its aesthetic aspect. The
scheme comprises of three phases: initial segmentation, iterative vertex
insertion, and iterative merging, followed by vertex adjustment. The initial
segmentation is used to detect sharp turnings - the vertices that seemingly
have high curvature. It is likely that some of important vertices with low
curvature might have been missed out at the first phase and so iterative vertex
insertion is used to add vertices in a region where the curvature changes
slowly but steadily. The initial phase may pick up some undesirable vertices
and so merging is used to eliminate the redundant vertices. Finally, vertex
adjustment is used to facilitate enhancement in the aesthetic look of the
approximation. The quality of the approximations is measured using Rosin's
measure. The robustness of the proposed scheme with respect to geometric
transformation is observed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统接触方法中主从表面划分导致的偏差问题，提升复杂几何接触场景的处理能力。

Method: 基于中间平面单次计算接触牵引力，采用真实穿透惩罚机制，系统分析3D接触段的几何配置以提高精度。

Result: 通过接触补丁测试/两梁弯曲/赫兹接触等验证，接触压力传递精度与有限元相当，网格细化后收敛于解析解。成功处理自接触和弹塑性碰撞问题。

Conclusion: 该算法在非共形网格中展现高精度接触处理能力，可广泛应用于平面/曲面接触、自接触及动态碰撞问题。

Abstract: This work introduces a contact interaction methodology for an unbiased
treatment of contacting surfaces without assigning surfaces as master and
slave. The contact tractions between interacting discrete segments are
evaluated with respect to a midplane in a single pass, inherently maintaining
the equilibrium of tractions. These tractions are based on the penalisation of
true interpenetration between opposite surfaces, and the procedure of their
integral for discrete contacting segments is described in this paper. A
meticulous examination of the different possible geometric configurations of
interacting 3D segments is presented to develop visual understanding and better
traction evaluation accuracy. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed
method are validated against the analytical solutions of the contact patch
test, two-beam bending, Hertzian contact, and flat punch test, thus proving the
capability to reproduce contact between flat surfaces, curved surfaces, and
sharp corners in contact, respectively. The method passes the contact patch
test with the uniform transmission of contact pressure matching the accuracy
levels of finite elements. It converges towards the analytical solution with
mesh refinement and a suitably high penalty factor. The effectiveness of the
proposed algorithm also extends to self-contact problems and has been tested
for self-contact between flat and curved surfaces with inelastic material.
Dynamic problems of elastic and inelastic collisions between bars, as well as
oblique collisions of cylinders, are also presented. The ability of the
algorithm to resolve contacts between flat and curved surfaces for nonconformal
meshes with high accuracy demonstrates its versatility in general contact
problems.

Motivation: 针对MR技术在临床中可用性有限的问题，开发训练系统以提升无辅助条件下的神经外科手术技能保持能力。

Method: 48名参与者分三组（无辅助/仅2D辅助/2D+3D辅助）进行数字化训练，随后在物理模型上进行无MR辅助测试，并与未训练对照组比较操作精度、时间等指标。

Result: 2D+3D组比对照组精确性提升44%，但操作时间延长；所有训练组均获得高可用性评分，各组间技术接受度无显著差异。

Conclusion: 混合视觉辅助有效提升无辅助操作表现，证明MR模拟器在神经外科训练中的实用价值，但需权衡操作时间成本。

Abstract: Neurosurgery increasingly uses Mixed Reality (MR) technologies for
intraoperative assistance. The greatest challenge in this area is mentally
reconstructing complex 3D anatomical structures from 2D slices with millimetric
precision, which is required in procedures like External Ventricular Drain
(EVD) placement. MR technologies have shown great potential in improving
surgical performance, however, their limited availability in clinical settings
underscores the need for training systems that foster skill retention in
unaided conditions. In this paper, we introduce NeuroMix, an MR-based simulator
for EVD placement. We conduct a study with 48 participants to assess the impact
of 2D and 3D visual aids on usability, cognitive load, technology acceptance,
and procedure precision and execution time. Three training modalities are
compared: one without visual aids, one with 2D aids only, and one combining
both 2D and 3D aids. The training phase takes place entirely on digital
objects, followed by a freehand EVD placement testing phase performed with a
physical catherer and a physical phantom without MR aids. We then compare the
participants performance with that of a control group that does not undergo
training. Our findings show that participants trained with both 2D and 3D aids
achieve a 44\% improvement in precision during unaided testing compared to the
control group, substantially higher than the improvement observed in the other
groups. All three training modalities receive high usability and technology
acceptance ratings, with significant equivalence across groups. The combination
of 2D and 3D visual aids does not significantly increase cognitive workload,
though it leads to longer operation times during freehand testing compared to
the control group.

Conclusion: 该方法为隐式曲面处理提供了通用高效的采样框架，在保持均匀性的同时突破传统网格依赖限制。

Abstract: Randomly sampling points on surfaces is an essential operation in geometry
processing. This sampling is computationally straightforward on explicit
meshes, but it is much more difficult on other shape representations, such as
widely-used implicit surfaces. This work studies a simple and general scheme
for sampling points on a surface, which is derived from a connection to the
intersections of random rays with the surface. Concretely, given a subroutine
to cast a ray against a surface and find all intersections, we can use that
subroutine to uniformly sample white noise points on the surface. This approach
is particularly effective in the context of implicit signed distance functions,
where sphere marching allows us to efficiently cast rays and sample points,
without needing to extract an intermediate mesh. We analyze the basic method to
show that it guarantees uniformity, and find experimentally that it is
significantly more efficient than alternative strategies on a variety of
representations. Furthermore, we show extensions to blue noise sampling and
stratified sampling, and applications to deform neural implicit surfaces as
well as moment estimation.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the challenges associated with using egocentric
devices to photorealistic reconstruct the scene in high dynamic range. Existing
methodologies typically assume using frame-rate 6DoF pose estimated from the
device's visual-inertial odometry system, which may neglect crucial details
necessary for pixel-accurate reconstruction. This study presents two
significant findings. Firstly, in contrast to mainstream work treating RGB
camera as global shutter frame-rate camera, we emphasize the importance of
employing visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) to calibrate the precise
timestamps and movement of the rolling shutter RGB sensing camera in a high
frequency trajectory format, which ensures an accurate calibration of the
physical properties of the rolling-shutter camera. Secondly, we incorporate a
physical image formation model based into Gaussian Splatting, which effectively
addresses the sensor characteristics, including the rolling-shutter effect of
RGB cameras and the dynamic ranges measured by sensors. Our proposed
formulation is applicable to the widely-used variants of Gaussian Splats
representation. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our pipeline using the
open-source Project Aria device under diverse indoor and outdoor lighting
conditions, and further validate it on a Meta Quest3 device. Across all
experiments, we observe a consistent visual enhancement of +1 dB in PSNR by
incorporating VIBA, with an additional +1 dB achieved through our proposed
image formation model. Our complete implementation, evaluation datasets, and

Abstract: We present ReXVQA, the largest and most comprehensive benchmark for visual
question answering (VQA) in chest radiology, comprising approximately 696,000
questions paired with 160,000 chest X-rays studies across training, validation,
and test sets. Unlike prior efforts that rely heavily on template based
queries, ReXVQA introduces a diverse and clinically authentic task suite
reflecting five core radiological reasoning skills: presence assessment,
location analysis, negation detection, differential diagnosis, and geometric
reasoning. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art multimodal large language models,
including MedGemma-4B-it, Qwen2.5-VL, Janus-Pro-7B, and Eagle2-9B. The
best-performing model (MedGemma) achieves 83.24% overall accuracy. To bridge
the gap between AI performance and clinical expertise, we conducted a
comprehensive human reader study involving 3 radiology residents on 200
randomly sampled cases. Our evaluation demonstrates that MedGemma achieved
superior performance (83.84% accuracy) compared to human readers (best
radiology resident: 77.27%), representing a significant milestone where AI
performance exceeds expert human evaluation on chest X-ray interpretation. The
reader study reveals distinct performance patterns between AI models and human
experts, with strong inter-reader agreement among radiologists while showing
more variable agreement patterns between human readers and AI models. ReXVQA
establishes a new standard for evaluating generalist radiological AI systems,
offering public leaderboards, fine-grained evaluation splits, structured
explanations, and category-level breakdowns. This benchmark lays the foundation
for next-generation AI systems capable of mimicking expert-level clinical
reasoning beyond narrow pathology classification. Our dataset will be

Conclusion: MSEF架起传感数据与社会情感推理的桥梁，为协调基础设施精度与生活体验提供方法创新与SDG11实践工具

Abstract: While objective street metrics derived from imagery or GIS have become
standard in urban analytics, they remain insufficient to capture subjective
perceptions essential to inclusive urban design. This study introduces a novel
Multimodal Street Evaluation Framework (MSEF) that fuses a vision transformer
(VisualGLM-6B) with a large language model (GPT-4), enabling interpretable
dual-output assessment of streetscapes. Leveraging over 15,000 annotated
street-view images from Harbin, China, we fine-tune the framework using LoRA
and P-Tuning v2 for parameter-efficient adaptation. The model achieves an F1
score of 0.84 on objective features and 89.3 percent agreement with aggregated
resident perceptions, validated across stratified socioeconomic geographies.
Beyond classification accuracy, MSEF captures context-dependent contradictions:
for instance, informal commerce boosts perceived vibrancy while simultaneously
reducing pedestrian comfort. It also identifies nonlinear and semantically
contingent patterns -- such as the divergent perceptual effects of
architectural transparency across residential and commercial zones -- revealing
the limits of universal spatial heuristics. By generating natural-language
rationales grounded in attention mechanisms, the framework bridges sensory data
with socio-affective inference, enabling transparent diagnostics aligned with
SDG 11. This work offers both methodological innovation in urban perception
modeling and practical utility for planning systems seeking to reconcile
infrastructural precision with lived experience.

Motivation: 研究动机是探索视觉语言模型(VLMs)对场景底层结构和语义的真实理解能力，填补系统性评估标准的空白。

Method: 提出可扩展的CIVET框架，通过控制变量生成无标注噪声/偏见的实验刺激，对5个SOTA模型进行统计严谨的测试。

Result: 1) 仅能识别有限基础属性 2) 性能高度依赖对象位置 3) 缺乏对象关系理解能力 4) 准确率显著低于人类标注者

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在场景理解的核心能力上仍存在本质缺陷，需突破基础认知能力才能实现类人水平。

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved competitive performance in
various tasks, their comprehension of the underlying structure and semantics of
a scene remains understudied. To investigate the understanding of VLMs, we
study their capability regarding object properties and relations in a
controlled and interpretable manner. To this scope, we introduce CIVET, a novel
and extensible framework for systematiC evaluatIon Via controllEd sTimuli.
CIVET addresses the lack of standardized systematic evaluation for assessing
VLMs' understanding, enabling researchers to test hypotheses with statistical
rigor. With CIVET, we evaluate five state-of-the-art VLMs on exhaustive sets of
stimuli, free from annotation noise, dataset-specific biases, and uncontrolled
scene complexity. Our findings reveal that 1) current VLMs can accurately
recognize only a limited set of basic object properties; 2) their performance
heavily depends on the position of the object in the scene; 3) they struggle to
understand basic relations among objects. Furthermore, a comparative evaluation
with human annotators reveals that VLMs still fall short of achieving
human-level accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出VideoMarathon长视频数据集（9700小时/3.3M QA对）和Hour-LLaVA模型，解决现有视频大模型长视频训练不足的问题，在多个基准达到最优表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长视频标注数据稀缺导致视频大模型训练受限，需要构建更丰富的长视频指令数据集以提升模型对小时级视频的理解能力。

Method: 1. 构建跨领域长视频数据集（3-60分钟/22种任务）；2. 设计内存增强模块，自适应整合全视频上下文时空语义，实现1-FPS高效长视频推理。

Result: Hour-LLaVA在多个长视频理解基准测试中取得最佳性能（如时间推理、场景理解等任务）

Conclusion: VideoMarathon数据集质量和任务多样性有效支撑长视频建模，Hour-LLaVA通过上下文缓存机制显著提升小时级视频理解效率与精度。

Abstract: Recent long-form video-language understanding benchmarks have driven progress
in video large multimodal models (Video-LMMs). However, the scarcity of
well-annotated long videos has left the training of hour-long Video-LLMs
underexplored. To close this gap, we present VideoMarathon, a large-scale
hour-long video instruction-following dataset. This dataset includes around
9,700 hours of long videos sourced from diverse domains, ranging from 3 to 60
minutes per video. Specifically, it contains 3.3M high-quality QA pairs,
spanning six fundamental topics: temporality, spatiality, object, action,
scene, and event. Compared to existing video instruction datasets,
VideoMarathon significantly extends training video durations up to 1 hour, and
supports 22 diverse tasks requiring both short- and long-term video
comprehension. Building on VideoMarathon, we propose Hour-LLaVA, a powerful and
efficient Video-LMM for hour-scale video-language modeling. It enables
hour-long video training and inference at 1-FPS sampling by leveraging a memory
augmentation module, which adaptively integrates user question-relevant and
spatiotemporal-informative semantics from a cached full video context. In our
experiments, Hour-LLaVA achieves the best performance on multiple long
video-language benchmarks, demonstrating the high quality of the VideoMarathon
dataset and the superiority of the Hour-LLaVA model.

TL;DR: 提出通过隐式BERT特征和显式剪枝机制增强字素与语音标签一致性的模型，生成适用于TTS和口音估计的并行数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ASR模型微调方法忽略字素与标签的深度关联，导致下游任务数据质量受限。需建立字素与语音标签的强关联以提升应用效果。

Method: 1. 基于预训练BERT的提示编码器实现隐式字素条件注入
2. 推理阶段显式剪枝与字素冲突的标签假设

Result: 字素-标签一致性显著提升，口音估计任务准确率提高验证了生成数据的有效性

Conclusion: 该方法为语音合成、口音分析等任务提供了更可靠的跨模态对齐数据，具有广泛的应用潜力

Abstract: We propose a model to obtain phonemic and prosodic labels of speech that are
coherent with graphemes. Unlike previous methods that simply fine-tune a
pre-trained ASR model with the labels, the proposed model conditions the label
generation on corresponding graphemes by two methods: 1) Add implicit grapheme
conditioning through prompt encoder using pre-trained BERT features. 2)
Explicitly prune the label hypotheses inconsistent with the grapheme during
inference. These methods enable obtaining parallel data of speech, the labels,
and graphemes, which is applicable to various downstream tasks such as
text-to-speech and accent estimation from text. Experiments showed that the
proposed method significantly improved the consistency between graphemes and
the predicted labels. Further, experiments on accent estimation task confirmed
that the created parallel data by the proposed method effectively improve the
estimation accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于WFST的解码存在流程复杂且无法利用大语言模型的局限性，且在语音转音素(S2P)和音素转字形(P2G)级联过程中存在信息损失

Method: 提出LLM-P2G框架(包含S2P和P2G模块)，配套开发数据噪声增强(DANP)和随机化Top-K边际化训练(TKM)策略

Result: 在波兰语和德语跨语言ASR任务中分别实现3.6%和6.9%的相对词错率降低

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了音素级联的信息损失问题，验证了大语言模型在语音识别解码阶段的适用性优势

Abstract: In automatic speech recognition (ASR), phoneme-based multilingual
pre-training and crosslingual fine-tuning is attractive for its high data
efficiency and competitive results compared to subword-based models. However,
Weighted Finite State Transducer (WFST) based decoding is limited by its
complex pipeline and inability to leverage large language models (LLMs).
Therefore, we propose LLM-based phoneme-to-grapheme (LLM-P2G) decoding for
phoneme-based ASR, consisting of speech-to-phoneme (S2P) and
phoneme-to-grapheme (P2G). A challenge is that there seems to have information
loss in cascading S2P and P2G. To address this challenge, we propose two
training strategies: data augmentation with noisy phonemes (DANP), and
randomized top-$K$ marginalized (TKM) training and decoding. Our experimental
results show that LLM-P2G outperforms WFST-based systems in crosslingual ASR
for Polish and German, by relative WER reductions of 3.6% and 6.9%
respectively.

TL;DR: 提出Exp4Fuse融合框架，通过间接应用LLM查询扩展提升稀疏检索器性能，在多个数据集实现SOTA结果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM查询扩展方法依赖高质量生成文档，需要复杂提示策略和密集检索技术，导致高成本和计算负担

Method: 设计双检索路径融合框架（原始查询+LLM增强查询），采用改进的倒数排名融合方法合并稀疏检索结果

Result: 在3个MS MARCO数据集和7个低资源数据集上超越现有方法，结合先进稀疏检索器时达到多项基准SOTA

Conclusion: Exp4Fuse通过间接查询扩展机制有效提升稀疏检索器性能，验证了融合策略在检索质量改进中的有效性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in generating hypothetical
documents for query expansion, thereby enhancing information retrieval
performance. However, the efficacy of this method is highly dependent on the
quality of the generated documents, which often requires complex prompt
strategies and the integration of advanced dense retrieval techniques. This can
be both costly and computationally intensive. To mitigate these limitations, we
explore the use of zero-shot LLM-based query expansion to improve sparse
retrieval, particularly for learned sparse retrievers. We introduce a novel
fusion ranking framework, Exp4Fuse, which enhances the performance of sparse
retrievers through an indirect application of zero-shot LLM-based query
expansion. Exp4Fuse operates by simultaneously considering two retrieval
routes-one based on the original query and the other on the LLM-augmented
query. It then generates two ranked lists using a sparse retriever and fuses
them using a modified reciprocal rank fusion method. We conduct extensive
evaluations of Exp4Fuse against leading LLM-based query expansion methods and
advanced retrieval techniques on three MS MARCO-related datasets and seven
low-resource datasets. Experimental results reveal that Exp4Fuse not only
surpasses existing LLM-based query expansion methods in enhancing sparse
retrievers but also, when combined with advanced sparse retrievers, achieves
SOTA results on several benchmarks. This highlights the superior performance
and effectiveness of Exp4Fuse in improving query expansion for sparse
retrieval.

Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的查询扩展方法存在计算成本高、资源消耗大和访问受限等问题，需要更轻量化的替代方案。

Method: 采用两阶段架构：1) 幻觉过滤器检测生成文档中的非事实内容 2) 带权重向量的组合器平衡查询与净化后文档的影响

Result: 在3个网页搜索和10个低资源数据集上，GOLFer超越其他小模型方案，并与大模型方法保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 该框架证明通过优化生成内容质量，小语言模型可有效替代大模型完成查询扩展任务。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-based query expansion for information retrieval
augments queries with generated hypothetical documents with LLMs. However, its
performance relies heavily on the scale of the language models (LMs),
necessitating larger, more advanced LLMs. This approach is costly,
computationally intensive, and often has limited accessibility. To address
these limitations, we introduce GOLFer - Smaller LMs-Generated Documents
Hallucination Filter & Combiner - a novel method leveraging smaller open-source
LMs for query expansion. GOLFer comprises two modules: a hallucination filter
and a documents combiner. The former detects and removes non-factual and
inconsistent sentences in generated documents, a common issue with smaller LMs,
while the latter combines the filtered content with the query using a weight
vector to balance their influence. We evaluate GOLFer alongside dominant
LLM-based query expansion methods on three web search and ten low-resource
datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that GOLFer consistently outperforms
other methods using smaller LMs, and maintains competitive performance against
methods using large-size LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Motivation: 解决ColPali/ColQwen2在可视化文档检索中因多patch编码导致内存消耗过高的问题

Method: 系统评估token pruning和token merging策略，最终在三个维度优化token merging组合方案

Result: Light版本仅需11.8%原始内存即保持98.2%性能，极端情况下2.8%内存仍保留94.6%效果

Conclusion: 该研究为高效VDR提供了新基线，揭示token merging比pruning更适配VDR特性的重要发现

Abstract: Despite the strong performance of ColPali/ColQwen2 in Visualized Document
Retrieval (VDR), it encodes each page into multiple patch-level embeddings and
leads to excessive memory usage. This empirical study investigates methods to
reduce patch embeddings per page at minimum performance degradation. We
evaluate two token-reduction strategies: token pruning and token merging.
Regarding token pruning, we surprisingly observe that a simple random strategy
outperforms other sophisticated pruning methods, though still far from
satisfactory. Further analysis reveals that pruning is inherently unsuitable
for VDR as it requires removing certain page embeddings without query-specific
information. Turning to token merging (more suitable for VDR), we search for
the optimal combinations of merging strategy across three dimensions and
develop Light-ColPali/ColQwen2. It maintains 98.2% of retrieval performance
with only 11.8% of original memory usage, and preserves 94.6% effectiveness at
2.8% memory footprint. We expect our empirical findings and resulting
Light-ColPali/ColQwen2 offer valuable insights and establish a competitive
baseline for future research towards efficient VDR.

Motivation: 现有安全防护策略忽视上游安全对齐数据的关键作用，本文从数据表示相似性角度探究安全防护失效的根本原因。

Method: 通过实验测量上游安全对齐数据集与下游微调任务的表示相似性，对比高低相似性场景下模型的安全防护表现差异。

Result: 高相似性使模型越狱成功率提升、危害评分增加；低相似性模型鲁棒性更强，危害评分最大降低10.33%。

Conclusion: 强调上游数据集设计对构建持久安全防护的重要性，为微调服务商提供预防性数据规划建议以减少现实攻击风险。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have underscored their
vulnerability to safety alignment jailbreaks, particularly when subjected to
downstream fine-tuning. However, existing mitigation strategies primarily focus
on reactively addressing jailbreak incidents after safety guardrails have been
compromised, removing harmful gradients during fine-tuning, or continuously
reinforcing safety alignment throughout fine-tuning. As such, they tend to
overlook a critical upstream factor: the role of the original safety-alignment
data. This paper therefore investigates the degradation of safety guardrails
through the lens of representation similarity between upstream alignment
datasets and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that
high similarity between these datasets significantly weakens safety guardrails,
making models more susceptible to jailbreaks. Conversely, low similarity
between these two types of datasets yields substantially more robust models and
thus reduces harmfulness score by up to 10.33%. By highlighting the importance
of upstream dataset design in the building of durable safety guardrails and
reducing real-world vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, these findings offer
actionable insights for fine-tuning service providers.

Motivation: 随着自主代理广泛替代用户决策，确保上下文完整性（即在特定任务中仅共享适当信息）成为核心挑战。现有方法缺乏对环境背景的系统化推理能力，导致隐私泄露风险。

Method: 1. 先引导大语言模型对信息共享进行显式上下文推理
2. 开发强化学习框架深化模型的上下文理解能力
3. 使用仅700例但覆盖多场景的合成数据集进行训练

Result: 方法在合成数据集上减少68%不当披露，且效果迁移至人类标注的PrivacyLens基准测试（评估AI助手隐私泄露）。不同模型规模/架构均保持任务完成度。

Conclusion: 验证了显式推理机制与强化学习结合的有效性，首次实现小样本合成数据到真实场景的跨域迁移，为AI系统的隐私保护提供新范式。

Abstract: As the era of autonomous agents making decisions on behalf of users unfolds,
ensuring contextual integrity (CI) -- what is the appropriate information to
share while carrying out a certain task -- becomes a central question to the
field. We posit that CI demands a form of reasoning where the agent needs to
reason about the context in which it is operating. To test this, we first
prompt LLMs to reason explicitly about CI when deciding what information to
disclose. We then extend this approach by developing a reinforcement learning
(RL) framework that further instills in models the reasoning necessary to
achieve CI. Using a synthetic, automatically created, dataset of only $\sim700$
examples but with diverse contexts and information disclosure norms, we show
that our method substantially reduces inappropriate information disclosure
while maintaining task performance across multiple model sizes and families.
Importantly, improvements transfer from this synthetic dataset to established
CI benchmarks such as PrivacyLens that has human annotations and evaluates
privacy leakage of AI assistants in actions and tool calls.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold promise for sustainable manufacturing, but
often hallucinate industrial codes and emission factors, undermining regulatory

industrial and waste entities with classification codes and GWP100 emission
data, enabling structured multi-hop reasoning. Natural language queries are
translated into SPARQL and verified subgraphs are retrieved to ensure accuracy
and traceability. Compared with Standalone LLMs and Naive RAG, CircuGraphRAG
achieves superior performance in single-hop and multi-hop question answering,
with ROUGE-L F1 scores up to 1.0, while baseline scores below 0.08. It also
improves efficiency, halving the response time and reducing token usage by 16%
in representative tasks. CircuGraphRAG provides fact-checked, regulatory-ready

Conclusion: 该任务对当前模型具有挑战性，但突破后可显著加速科学发现进程

Abstract: Contemporary approaches to assisted scientific discovery use language models
to automatically generate large numbers of potential hypothesis to test, while
also automatically generating code-based experiments to test those hypotheses.
While hypotheses can be comparatively inexpensive to generate, automated
experiments can be costly, particularly when run at scale (i.e. thousands of
experiments). Developing the capacity to filter hypotheses based on their
feasibility would allow discovery systems to run at scale, while increasing
their likelihood of making significant discoveries. In this work we introduce
Matter-of-Fact, a challenge dataset for determining the feasibility of
hypotheses framed as claims. Matter-of-Fact includes 8.4k claims extracted from
scientific articles spanning four high-impact contemporary materials science
topics, including superconductors, semiconductors, batteries, and aerospace
materials, while including qualitative and quantitative claims from
theoretical, experimental, and code/simulation results. We show that strong
baselines that include retrieval augmented generation over scientific
literature and code generation fail to exceed 72% performance on this task
(chance performance is 50%), while domain-expert verification suggests nearly
all are solvable -- highlighting both the difficulty of this task for current
models, and the potential to accelerate scientific discovery by making
near-term progress.

Abstract: Reasoning models represented by the Deepseek-R1-Distill series have been

reveals that their benchmark evaluation results are subject to significant

conditions can lead to substantial variations in results. Similar phenomena are
observed in other open-source inference models fine-tuned based on the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series, as well as in the QwQ-32B model, making their
claimed performance improvements difficult to reproduce reliably. Therefore, we
advocate for the establishment of a more rigorous paradigm for model

Conclusion: 揭示了推理模型特有的诚信问题，为可信AI对齐提供了可解释性工具，推动基于激活引导的防御机制开发

Abstract: The honesty of large language models (LLMs) is a critical alignment
challenge, especially as advanced systems with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
may strategically deceive humans. Unlike traditional honesty issues on LLMs,
which could be possibly explained as some kind of hallucination, those models'
explicit thought paths enable us to study strategic deception--goal-driven,
intentional misinformation where reasoning contradicts outputs. Using
representation engineering, we systematically induce, detect, and control such
deception in CoT-enabled LLMs, extracting "deception vectors" via Linear
Artificial Tomography (LAT) for 89% detection accuracy. Through activation
steering, we achieve a 40% success rate in eliciting context-appropriate
deception without explicit prompts, unveiling the specific honesty-related
issue of reasoning models and providing tools for trustworthy AI alignment.

Conclusion: LLM自主引导搜索在复杂任务中更高效，模型与算力的扩展性优势显著，为推理任务提供新范式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable improvements in
reasoning and planning through increased test-time compute, often by framing
problem-solving as a search process. While methods like Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) have proven effective in some domains, their reliance on fixed
exploration hyperparameters limits their adaptability across tasks of varying
difficulty, rendering them impractical or expensive in certain settings. In
this paper, we propose \textbf{LLM-First Search (LFS)}, a novel \textit{LLM
Self-Guided Search} method that removes the need for pre-defined search
strategies by empowering the LLM to autonomously control the search process via
self-guided exploration. Rather than relying on external heuristics or
hardcoded policies, the LLM evaluates whether to pursue the current search path
or explore alternative branches based on its internal scoring mechanisms. This
enables more flexible and context-sensitive reasoning without requiring manual
tuning or task-specific adaptation. We evaluate LFS on Countdown and Sudoku
against three classic widely-used search algorithms, Tree-of-Thoughts' Breadth
First Search (ToT-BFS), Best First Search (BestFS), and MCTS, each of which
have been used to achieve SotA results on a range of challenging reasoning
tasks. We found that LFS (1) performs better on more challenging tasks without
additional tuning, (2) is more computationally efficient compared to the other
methods, especially when powered by a stronger model, (3) scales better with
stronger models, due to its LLM-First design, and (4) scales better with
increased compute budget. Our code is publicly available at

Abstract: The NLP research community has made publicly available numerous instruments
for measuring representational harms caused by large language model (LLM)-based
systems. These instruments have taken the form of datasets, metrics, tools, and
more. In this paper, we examine the extent to which such instruments meet the
needs of practitioners tasked with evaluating LLM-based systems. Via
semi-structured interviews with 12 such practitioners, we find that
practitioners are often unable to use publicly available instruments for
measuring representational harms. We identify two types of challenges. In some
cases, instruments are not useful because they do not meaningfully measure what

TL;DR: 论文区分了行为系统性与表征系统性，强调现有基准主要测试行为层面，并提出结合机械可解释性方法评估表征系统性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对现有系统性泛化研究多关注行为层面而忽视表征层面（与Fodor和Pylyshyn的原始论点存在差距），需明确区分二者并改进评估体系。

Method: 1. 基于Hadley（1994）的分类法分析语言和视觉领域主流基准测试的行为系统性；2. 引入机械可解释性领域的方法评估表征系统性。

Result: 揭示现有基准对行为系统性的测试局限性，提出表征系统性的评估框架，为系统性泛化研究提供新方向。

Conclusion: 系统性研究需兼顾行为与表征层面，机械可解释性方法为深入理解模型系统性机制提供关键工具。

Abstract: A core aspect of compositionality, systematicity is a desirable property in
ML models as it enables strong generalization to novel contexts. This has led
to numerous studies proposing benchmarks to assess systematic generalization,
as well as models and training regimes designed to enhance it. Many of these
efforts are framed as addressing the challenge posed by Fodor and Pylyshyn.
However, while they argue for systematicity of representations, existing
benchmarks and models primarily focus on the systematicity of behaviour. We
emphasize the crucial nature of this distinction. Furthermore, building on
Hadley's (1994) taxonomy of systematic generalization, we analyze the extent to
which behavioural systematicity is tested by key benchmarks in the literature
across language and vision. Finally, we highlight ways of assessing
systematicity of representations in ML models as practiced in the field of
mechanistic interpretability.

TL;DR: 提出通过输入数据聚类和中位数聚合算法改进差分隐私语言模型，显著降低隐私成本的同时生成更高质量的合成文本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于均匀采样的差分隐私文本生成方法在处理异构主题数据时存在质量下降问题，需要改进批量选择策略和统计聚合方式

Method: 1. 对输入数据进行聚类预处理 2. 利用预测相似性设计基于中位数的私有统计聚合算法 3. 通过数据依赖的局部敏感度实现事后差分隐私保证

Result: 在MAUVE等代表性指标和下游任务性能上显著提升，相比现有方法在相同质量下降低50%隐私预算消耗

Conclusion: 结合数据聚类和鲁棒统计方法，能够在更低的隐私成本下生成高质量合成文本，为实用化隐私保护语言模型提供新方向

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) language model inference is an approach for
generating private synthetic text. A sensitive input example is used to prompt
an off-the-shelf large language model (LLM) to produce a similar example.
Multiple examples can be aggregated together to formally satisfy the DP
guarantee.
  Prior work creates inference batches by sampling sensitive inputs uniformly
at random. We show that uniform sampling degrades the quality of privately
generated text, especially when the sensitive examples concern heterogeneous
topics.
  We remedy this problem by clustering the input data before selecting
inference batches. Next, we observe that clustering also leads to more similar
next-token predictions across inferences. We use this insight to introduce a
new algorithm that aggregates next token statistics by privately computing
medians instead of averages. This approach leverages the fact that the median
has decreased local sensitivity when next token predictions are similar,
allowing us to state a data-dependent and ex-post DP guarantee about the
privacy properties of this algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate improvements in
terms of representativeness metrics (e.g., MAUVE) as well as downstream task
performance. We show that our method produces high-quality synthetic data at
significantly lower privacy cost than a previous state-of-the-art method.

Abstract: We introduce $Urania$, a novel framework for generating insights about LLM
chatbot interactions with rigorous differential privacy (DP) guarantees. The
framework employs a private clustering mechanism and innovative keyword
extraction methods, including frequency-based, TF-IDF-based, and LLM-guided
approaches. By leveraging DP tools such as clustering, partition selection, and
histogram-based summarization, $Urania$ provides end-to-end privacy protection.
Our evaluation assesses lexical and semantic content preservation, pair
similarity, and LLM-based metrics, benchmarking against a non-private
Clio-inspired pipeline (Tamkin et al., 2024). Moreover, we develop a simple
empirical privacy evaluation that demonstrates the enhanced robustness of our
DP pipeline. The results show the framework's ability to extract meaningful
conversational insights while maintaining stringent user privacy, effectively
balancing data utility with privacy preservation.

Abstract: Healthcare systems face significant challenges in managing and interpreting
vast, heterogeneous patient data for personalized care. Existing approaches
often focus on narrow use cases with a limited feature space, overlooking the
complex, longitudinal interactions needed for a holistic understanding of
patient health. In this work, we propose a novel approach to patient pathway
modeling by transforming diverse electronic health record (EHR) data into a
structured representation and designing a holistic pathway prediction model,
EHR2Path, optimized to predict future health trajectories. Further, we
introduce a novel summary mechanism that embeds long-term temporal context into
topic-specific summary tokens, improving performance over text-only models,
while being much more token-efficient. EHR2Path demonstrates strong performance
in both next time-step prediction and longitudinal simulation, outperforming
competitive baselines. It enables detailed simulations of patient trajectories,
inherently targeting diverse evaluation tasks, such as forecasting vital signs,
lab test results, or length-of-stay, opening a path towards predictive and
personalized healthcare.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in training long-context reasoning models via
reinforcement learning (RL), several open questions and counterintuitive
behaviors remain. This work focuses on three key aspects: (1) We systematically
analyze the roles of positive and negative samples in RL, revealing that
positive samples mainly facilitate data fitting, whereas negative samples
significantly enhance generalization and robustness. Interestingly, training
solely on negative samples can rival standard RL training performance. (2) We
identify substantial data inefficiency in group relative policy optimization,
where over half of the samples yield zero advantage. To address this, we
explore two straightforward strategies, including relative length rewards and
offline sample injection, to better leverage these data and enhance reasoning
efficiency and capability. (3) We investigate unstable performance across
various reasoning models and benchmarks, attributing instability to uncertain
problems with ambiguous outcomes, and demonstrate that multiple evaluation runs
mitigate this issue.

Motivation: 现有基于图对比学习的方法存在正样本对数量不足和权重分配不合理的问题，导致低度数节点信息获取不充分且受噪声干扰。需要更有效的机制来缓解GNN的度数偏差。

Method: 1. HAR对比损失函数：利用节点标签扩展正样本对，基于学习难度动态调整正负样本权重

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，SHARP在全局准确率和各度数节点分类性能上均优于基线模型，最高提升达12.3%。理论分析证明了权重自适应机制的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过创新性的正样本扩展和自适应加权策略，HAR成功缓解了GNN的度数偏差问题，SHARP框架为后续研究提供了可扩展的实验基准。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often suffer from degree bias in node
classification tasks, where prediction performance varies across nodes with
different degrees. Several approaches, which adopt Graph Contrastive Learning
(GCL), have been proposed to mitigate this bias. However, the limited number of
positive pairs and the equal weighting of all positives and negatives in GCL
still lead to low-degree nodes acquiring insufficient and noisy information.
This paper proposes the Hardness Adaptive Reweighted (HAR) contrastive loss to
mitigate degree bias. It adds more positive pairs by leveraging node labels and
adaptively weights positive and negative pairs based on their learning
hardness. In addition, we develop an experimental framework named SHARP to
extend HAR to a broader range of scenarios. Both our theoretical analysis and
experiments validate the effectiveness of SHARP. The experimental results
across four datasets show that SHARP achieves better performance against
baselines at both global and degree levels.

TL;DR: 提出Diagonal Batching技术解决RMT模型顺序执行瓶颈，实现3.3倍加速


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer长文本处理存在二次方复杂度，RMT模型虽改进但受限于顺序更新机制

Method: 通过跨段并行调度方案保持严格循环依赖，纯运行时计算重排序无需模型重训练

Result: 在131k token序列上实现3.3倍于标准LLaMA-1B、1.8倍于顺序RMT的推理加速

Conclusion: Diagonal Batching通过消除顺序瓶颈，使RMT成为实际长文本应用的可行解决方案

Abstract: Transformer models struggle with long-context inference due to their
quadratic time and linear memory complexity. Recurrent Memory Transformers
(RMTs) offer a solution by reducing the asymptotic cost to linear time and
constant memory usage. However, their memory update mechanism leads to
sequential execution, causing a performance bottleneck.
  We introduce Diagonal Batching, a scheduling scheme that unlocks parallelism
across segments in RMTs while preserving exact recurrence. This approach
eliminates the sequential constraint, enabling efficient GPU inference even for
single long-context inputs without complex batching and pipelining techniques.
Because the technique is purely a run-time computation reordering, existing RMT
models adopt it with no retraining.
  Applied to a LLaMA-1B ARMT model, Diagonal Batching yields a 3.3x speedup
over standard full-attention LLaMA-1B and a 1.8x speedup over the sequential
RMT implementation on 131,072-token sequences. By removing sequential
bottleneck, Diagonal Batching reduces inference cost and latency, thereby
strengthening RMTs as a practical solution for real-world, long-context
applications.

Method: 在Mesa层基础上开发数值稳定、支持分块并行的架构，采用共轭梯度求解器实时优化上下文损失函数

Result: 在十亿参数规模下实现更低语言模型困惑度，长上下文理解任务表现突出，但推理FLOPs增加1.5倍

Conclusion: 将序列优化问题嵌入神经网络内部的计算范式，印证了通过增加推理时计算提升性能的新趋势

Abstract: Sequence modeling is currently dominated by causal transformer architectures
that use softmax self-attention. Although widely adopted, transformers require
scaling memory and compute linearly during inference. A recent stream of work
linearized the softmax operation, resulting in powerful recurrent neural
network (RNN) models with constant memory and compute costs such as DeltaNet,
Mamba or xLSTM. These models can be unified by noting that their recurrent
layer dynamics can all be derived from an in-context regression objective,
approximately optimized through an online learning rule. Here, we join this
line of work and introduce a numerically stable, chunkwise parallelizable
version of the recently proposed Mesa layer (von Oswald et al., 2024), and
study it in language modeling at the billion-parameter scale. This layer again
stems from an in-context loss, but which is now minimized to optimality at
every time point using a fast conjugate gradient solver. Through an extensive
suite of experiments, we show that optimal test-time training enables reaching
lower language modeling perplexity and higher downstream benchmark performance
than previous RNNs, especially on tasks requiring long context understanding.
This performance gain comes at the cost of additional flops spent during
inference time. Our results are therefore intriguingly related to recent trends
of increasing test-time compute to improve performance -- here by spending
compute to solve sequential optimization problems within the neural network
itself.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升RL微调效率，为实际应用提供有效解决方案

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become an effective approach for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs), particularly to enhance their reasoning
capabilities. However, RL fine-tuning remains highly resource-intensive, and
existing work has largely overlooked the problem of data efficiency. In this
paper, we propose two techniques to improve data efficiency in LLM RL
fine-tuning: difficulty-targeted online data selection and rollout replay. We
introduce the notion of adaptive difficulty to guide online data selection,
prioritizing questions of moderate difficulty that are more likely to yield
informative learning signals. To estimate adaptive difficulty efficiently, we
develop an attention-based framework that requires rollouts for only a small
reference set of questions. The adaptive difficulty of the remaining questions
is then estimated based on their similarity to this set. To further reduce
rollout cost, we introduce a rollout replay mechanism that reuses recent
rollouts, lowering per-step computation while maintaining stable updates.
Extensive experiments across 6 LLM-dataset combinations show that our method
reduces RL fine-tuning time by 25% to 65% to reach the same level of
performance as the original GRPO algorithm.

Method: 通过分析0.6B-32B参数模型，提出融合计算与内存成本的动力学定律；设计基于稀疏注意力的新扩展范式，降低单token成本

Result: 稀疏模型在低成本区实现60+准确率提升，高成本区提升5+点（AIME测评），在MoE模型上也显示持续优势

Conclusion: 稀疏注意力是释放测试扩展潜力的关键，因其突破参数扩展的饱和效应，通过增加生成量持续提升准确率

Abstract: We rethink test-time scaling laws from a practical efficiency perspective,
revealing that the effectiveness of smaller models is significantly
overestimated. Prior work, grounded in compute-optimality, overlooks critical
memory access bottlenecks introduced by inference-time strategies (e.g.,
Best-of-$N$, long CoTs). Our holistic analysis, spanning models from 0.6B to
32B parameters, reveals a new Kinetics Scaling Law that better guides resource
allocation by incorporating both computation and memory access costs. Kinetics
Scaling Law suggests that test-time compute is more effective when used on
models above a threshold than smaller ones. A key reason is that in TTS,
attention, rather than parameter count, emerges as the dominant cost factor.
Motivated by this, we propose a new scaling paradigm centered on sparse
attention, which lowers per-token cost and enables longer generations and more
parallel samples within the same resource budget. Empirically, we show that
sparse attention models consistently outperform dense counterparts, achieving
over 60 points gains in low-cost regimes and over 5 points gains in high-cost
regimes for problem-solving accuracy on AIME, encompassing evaluations on
state-of-the-art MoEs. These results suggest that sparse attention is essential
for realizing the full potential of test-time scaling because, unlike training,
where parameter scaling saturates, test-time accuracy continues to improve
through increased generation. The code is available at

Motivation: Transformer大语言模型的推理成本受KV缓存容量限制而非token数量，压缩KV缓存可突破该瓶颈实现超缩放（hyper-scaling）

Method: 动态记忆稀疏化（DMS）：1）延迟token驱逐而非直接丢弃；2）隐式合并表示保留关键信息；3）仅需1K训练步适配压缩策略

Result: Qwen-R1 32B模型在AIME 24/GPQA/LiveCodeBench基准分别提升9.1/7.6/9.6分，在相同内存和计算资源下实现更高精度

Conclusion: DMS验证了推理时超缩放的有效性，通过KV缓存压缩打破效率-精度权衡，为LLM部署提供新优化方向

Abstract: Inference-time scaling trades efficiency for increased reasoning accuracy by
generating longer or more parallel sequences. However, in Transformer LLMs,
generation cost is bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache, rather
than the number of generated tokens. Hence, we explore inference-time
hyper-scaling: by compressing the KV cache, we can generate more tokens within
the same compute budget and further improve the accuracy of scaled inference.
The success of this approach, however, hinges on the ability of compression
methods to preserve accuracy even at high compression ratios. To make
hyper-scaling practical, we introduce Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), a
novel method for sparsifying KV caches that only requires 1K training steps to
achieve 8$\times$ compression, while maintaining better accuracy than
training-free sparse attention. Instead of prematurely discarding cached
tokens, DMS delays token eviction, implicitly merging representations and
preserving critical information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
inference-time hyper-scaling with DMS on multiple families of LLMs, showing
that it boosts accuracy for comparable inference runtime and memory load. For
instance, we enhance Qwen-R1 32B by an average of 9.1 points on AIME 24, 7.6 on
GPQA, and 9.6 on LiveCodeBench across compute budgets.

Abstract: Speech disorders can make communication hard or even impossible for those who
develop them. Personalised Text-to-Speech is an attractive option as a
communication aid. We attempt voice reconstruction using a large speech model,
with which we generate an approximation of a dysarthric speaker's voice prior
to the onset of their condition. In particular, we investigate whether a
state-of-the-art large speech model, Parler TTS, can generate intelligible
speech while maintaining speaker identity. We curate a dataset and annotate it
with relevant speaker and intelligibility information, and use this to
fine-tune the model. Our results show that the model can indeed learn to
generate from the distribution of this challenging data, but struggles to
control intelligibility and to maintain consistent speaker identity. We propose
future directions to improve controllability of this class of model, for the
voice reconstruction task.

Abstract: Speech language models (Speech LMs) enable end-to-end speech-text modelling
within a single model, offering a promising direction for spoken dialogue
systems. The choice of speech-text jointly decoding paradigm plays a critical
role in performance, efficiency, and alignment quality. In this work, we
systematically compare representative joint speech-text decoding
strategies-including the interleaved, and parallel generation paradigms-under a
controlled experimental setup using the same base language model, speech
tokenizer and training data. Our results show that the interleaved approach
achieves the best alignment. However it suffers from slow inference due to long
token sequence length. To address this, we propose a novel early-stop
interleaved (ESI) pattern that not only significantly accelerates decoding but
also yields slightly better performance. Additionally, we curate high-quality
question answering (QA) datasets to further improve speech QA performance.

Motivation: 现有LLM主要应用于同步对话场景，而现实团队协作/社交游戏等异步场景中何时发言同样关键，需探索LLM在异步环境的应用能力

Method: 构建自适应异步LLM代理(同时决策发言内容与时机)，通过收集人类与AI共同参与的在线Mafia游戏数据集进行验证

Result: 代理游戏表现与人类相当，发言时机决策模式与人类高度相似，但生成内容存在差异

Conclusion: 该研究为LLM融入真实人类群体场景(团队协作/教育等复杂社交环境)提供了技术基础，开源数据代码支持后续异步通信研究

Abstract: LLMs are used predominantly in synchronous communication, where a human user
and a model communicate in alternating turns. In contrast, many real-world
settings are inherently asynchronous. For example, in group chats, online team
meetings, or social games, there is no inherent notion of turns; therefore, the
decision of when to speak forms a crucial part of the participant's decision
making. In this work, we develop an adaptive asynchronous LLM-agent which, in
addition to determining what to say, also decides when to say it. To evaluate
our agent, we collect a unique dataset of online Mafia games, including both
human participants, as well as our asynchronous agent. Overall, our agent
performs on par with human players, both in game performance, as well as in its
ability to blend in with the other human players. Our analysis shows that the
agent's behavior in deciding when to speak closely mirrors human patterns,
although differences emerge in message content. We release all our data and
code to support and encourage further research for more realistic asynchronous
communication between LLM agents. This work paves the way for integration of
LLMs into realistic human group settings, from assistance in team discussions
to educational and professional environments where complex social dynamics must
be navigated.

Abstract: Medical imaging segmentation is essential in clinical settings for diagnosing
diseases, planning surgeries, and other procedures. However, manual annotation
is a cumbersome and effortful task. To mitigate these aspects, this study
implements and evaluates the usability and clinical applicability of an
extended reality (XR)-based segmentation tool for anatomical CT scans, using
the Meta Quest 3 headset and Logitech MX Ink stylus. We develop an immersive
interface enabling real-time interaction with 2D and 3D medical imaging data in
a customizable workspace designed to mitigate workflow fragmentation and
cognitive demands inherent to conventional manual segmentation tools. The
platform combines stylus-driven annotation, mirroring traditional pen-on-paper
workflows, with instant 3D volumetric rendering. A user study with a public
craniofacial CT dataset demonstrated the tool's foundational viability,
achieving a System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 66, within the expected range
for medical applications. Participants highlighted the system's intuitive
controls (scoring 4.1/5 for self-descriptiveness on ISONORM metrics) and
spatial interaction design, with qualitative feedback highlighting strengths in
hybrid 2D/3D navigation and realistic stylus ergonomics. While users identified
opportunities to enhance task-specific precision and error management, the
platform's core workflow enabled dynamic slice adjustment, reducing cognitive
load compared to desktop tools. Results position the XR-stylus paradigm as a
promising foundation for immersive segmentation tools, with iterative
refinements targeting haptic feedback calibration and workflow personalization
to advance adoption in preoperative planning.

Abstract: As one of the first research teams with full access to Siemens' Cinematic
Reality, we evaluate its usability and clinical potential for cinematic volume
rendering on the Apple Vision Pro. We visualized venous-phase liver computed
tomography and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography scans from the CHAOS
and MRCP\_DLRecon datasets. Fourteen medical experts assessed usability and
anticipated clinical integration potential using the System Usability Scale,
ISONORM 9242-110-S questionnaire, and an open-ended survey. Their feedback
identified feasibility, key usability strengths, and required features to
catalyze the adaptation in real-world clinical workflows. The findings provide
insights into the potential of immersive cinematic rendering in medical
imaging.
