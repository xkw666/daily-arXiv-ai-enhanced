However, most existing mesh simplification methods exhibit\na few issues. Firstly, they often lead to self-intersections during decimation,\na major issue for applications such as 3D printing and soft-body simulation.\nSecond, to perform simplification on a mesh in the wild, one would first need\nto perform re-meshing, which often suffers from surface shifts and losses of\nsharp features. Finally, existing re-meshing and simplification methods can\ntake minutes when processing large-scale meshes, limiting their applications in\npractice. To address the challenges, we introduce a novel GPU-based mesh\noptimization approach containing three key components: (1) a parallel\nre-meshing algorithm to turn meshes in the wild into watertight, manifold, and\nintersection-free ones, and reduce the prevalence of poorly shaped triangles;\n(2) a robust parallel simplification algorithm with intersection-free\nguarantees; (3) an optimization-based safe projection algorithm to realign the\nsimplified mesh with the input, eliminating the surface shift introduced by\nre-meshing and recovering the original sharp features. The algorithm\ndemonstrates remarkable efficiency, simplifying a 2-million-face mesh to 20k\ntriangles in 3 seconds on RTX4090.

This study overcomes\nthis challenge by offering a fabrication algorithm for direct 3D printing of\nsuch networks with programmed tension gradients, an approach analogous to the\nspinning of spiderwebs. The algorithm: (i) defines the desired network and\nprescribes its tension gradients using the force density method; (ii) converts\nthe network into an unstretched counterpart by numerically optimizing vertex\nlocations toward target element lengths and converting straight elements into\narcs to resolve any remaining error; and (iii) decomposes the network into\nprintable toolpaths; Optional additional steps are: (iv) flattening curved 2D\nnetworks or 3D networks to ensure 3D printing compatibility; and (v)\nautomatically resolving any unwanted crossings introduced by the flattening\nprocess. The proposed method is experimentally validated using 2D unit cells of\nviscoelastic filaments, where accurate tension gradients are achieved with an\naverage element strain error of less than 1.0\\%.

Traditional skeletal animation methods maintain geometric\nconsistency but struggle with complex non-rigid elements like flowing hair and\nskirts, leading to unnatural deformation. Conversely, video diffusion models\nsynthesize realistic dynamics but often create geometric distortions in\nstylized drawings due to domain gaps. This work proposes a hybrid animation\nsystem that combines skeletal animation and video diffusion. Initially, coarse\nimages are generated from characters retargeted with skeletal animations for\ngeometric guidance. These images are then enhanced in texture and secondary\ndynamics using video diffusion priors, framing this enhancement as an\ninpainting task. A domain-adapted diffusion model refines user-masked regions\nneeding improvement, especially for secondary dynamics. To enhance motion\nrealism further, we introduce a Secondary Dynamics Injection (SDI) strategy in\nthe denoising process, incorporating features from a pre-trained diffusion\nmodel enriched with human motion priors.

On the other hand, methods for estimating\nbiomechanically accurate skeletal motion typically rely on complex motion\ncapture systems and expensive optimization methods. What is needed is a\nparametric 3D human model with a biomechanically accurate skeletal structure\nthat can be easily posed. To that end, we develop SKEL, which re-rigs the SMPL\nbody model with a biomechanics skeleton. To enable this, we need training data\nof skeletons inside SMPL meshes in diverse poses.\n  We build such a dataset by optimizing biomechanically accurate skeletons\ninside SMPL meshes from AMASS sequences.

Recent research into the internal mechanisms of\nLLMs has identified the refusal direction (r-direction) in the hidden states,\nwhich plays a pivotal role in governing refusal behavior. Building on this\ninsight, our study reveals that the r-direction tends to drift during training,\nwhich we identify as one of the causes of the associated safety risks. To\nmitigate such drift, our proposed ProCon method introduces a\nprojection-constrained loss term that regularizes the projection magnitude of\neach training sample's hidden state onto the r-direction. Our initial analysis\nshows that applying an appropriate constraint can effectively mitigate the\nrefusal direction drift and associated safety risks, but remains limited by\noverall performance barriers. To overcome this barrier, informed by our\nobservation of early-stage sharp drift and a data-driven perspective, we\nintroduce a warm-up strategy that emphasizes early-stage strong constraints and\nbroaden the data distribution to strengthen constraint signals, leading to an\nenhanced ProCon method.

We introduce two complementary algorithms: historical exploration,\nwhich encourages rarely observed answers via UCB-style bonuses, and batch\nexploration, which penalizes within-batch repetition to promote test-time\ndiversity. Experiments on standard competition math with Llama and Qwen models\ndemonstrate that both methods improve accuracy while mitigating diversity\ncollapse. On the theoretical side, we formalize the benefit of outcome-based\nexploration through a new model of outcome-based bandits. Together, these\ncontributions chart a practical path toward RL methods that enhance reasoning\nwithout sacrificing the diversity essential for scalable deployment."}

Motivated by\nrecent advances in interleaving reasoning, we explore whether such reasoning\ncan further improve Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. We introduce Interleaving\nReasoning Generation (IRG), a framework that alternates between text-based\nthinking and image synthesis: the model first produces a text-based thinking to\nguide an initial image, then reflects on the result to refine fine-grained\ndetails, visual quality, and aesthetics while preserving semantics. To train\nIRG effectively, we propose Interleaving Reasoning Generation Learning (IRGL),\nwhich targets two sub-goals: (1) strengthening the initial think-and-generate\nstage to establish core content and base quality, and (2) enabling high-quality\ntextual reflection and faithful implementation of those refinements in a\nsubsequent image. We curate IRGL-300K, a dataset organized into six decomposed\nlearning modes that jointly cover learning text-based thinking, and full\nthinking-image trajectories. Starting from a unified foundation model that\nnatively emits interleaved text-image outputs, our two-stage training first\nbuilds robust thinking and reflection, then efficiently tunes the IRG pipeline\nin the full thinking-image trajectory data. Extensive experiments show SoTA\nperformance, yielding absolute gains of 5-10 points on GenEval, WISE, TIIF,\nGenAI-Bench, and OneIG-EN, alongside substantial improvements in visual quality\nand fine-grained fidelity. The code, model weights and datasets will be\nreleased in: https://github.com/Osilly/Interleaving-Reasoning-Generation ."}
