### [1] [StreetMath: Study of LLMs' Approximation Behaviors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25776)
*Chiung-Yi Tseng,Somshubhra Roy,Maisha Thasin,Danyang Zhang,Blessing Effiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大语言模型在街头数学场景中倾向于进行精确计算而非近似推理，精确运算与近似运算依赖不同神经组件且未展现人类认知吝啬特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究过度关注大语言模型的精确计算能力，缺乏对其非正式场景近似推理能力的探索，尤其非自回归模型的机制尚未明确。

Method: 通过StreetMath基准测试不同架构模型（Qwen3/Falcon/Mamba等），运用机制可解释性技术分析内部计算状态，并进行神经组件分离实验。

Result: 模型在近似任务中仍追求精确解，早期层可得正确答案但消耗更多token，精确与近似运算神经路径存在明显分离现象。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在现实数学场景存在架构局限，需针对性改进计算机制，研究开源基准促进后续发展。

Abstract: There is a substantial body of literature examining the mathematical
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
performance on precise arithmetic operations in autoregressive architectures.
However, their ability to perform approximate reasoning in informal, fast-paced
mathematical operations has received far less attention, especially among
non-autoregressive decoder models. Our work addresses this gap by introducing
StreetMath, a benchmark designed to evaluate models' approximation abilities
under real-world approximation scenarios. We conduct extensive evaluations
across different LLM architectures: Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507,
Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507, Dream-v0-Instruct-7B, Falcon-Mamba-7B-Instruct, and
Mamba-GPT-3B. Furthermore, we apply mechanistic interpretability techniques to
probe their internal computational states. Our analysis reveals that LLMs
generally attempt to compute exact values or invoke external tools even in
tasks that call for approximation. Moreover, while models sometimes reach the
correct answer in early layers or steps, they still consume more tokens when
solving approximation tasks. Additional experiments indicate that exact and
approximate arithmetic operations rely on largely separate neural components.
Drawing upon research on cognitive psychology, we argue that LLMs do not
exhibit cognitive miserliness in the same way humans do in street math
settings. We open source our work https://github.com/ctseng777/StreetMath

### [2] [Review Based Entity Ranking using Fuzzy Logic Algorithmic Approach: Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25778)
*Pratik N. Kalamkar,Anupama G. Phakatkar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出结合模糊逻辑和句法依赖分析的细粒度情感强度分类方法，改进现有词典方法忽略观点强度的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有整体词典方法未考虑观点强度梯度（如非常强烈/中等/微弱等），无法满足细粒度情感分析需求

Method: 1. 使用模糊逻辑算法对观点词（副词/形容词/名词/动词）进行强度分类
2. 应用句法依赖解析提取特定产品属性的关联观点词
3. 结合用户查询进行实体多维度评分

Result: 实现基于观点方向和强度的五级分类（非常弱/弱/中等/强/非常强），建立细粒度实体排名框架

Conclusion: 该方法通过融合语言学特征和模糊逻辑，显著提升了观点强度分析的颗粒度和准确性

Abstract: Opinion mining, also called sentiment analysis, is the field of study that
analyzes people opinions, sentiments, evaluations, appraisals, attitudes, and
emotions towards entities such as products, services, organizations,
individuals, issues, events, topics, and their attributes. Holistic
lexicon-based approach does not consider the strength of each opinion, i.e.,
whether the opinion is very strongly negative (or positive), strongly negative
(or positive), moderate negative (or positive), very weakly negative (or
positive) and weakly negative (or positive). In this paper, we propose approach
to rank entities based on orientation and strength of the entity reviews and
user's queries by classifying them in granularity levels (i.e. very weak, weak,
moderate, very strong and strong) by combining opinion words (i.e. adverb,
adjective, noun and verb) that are related to aspect of interest of certain
product. We shall use fuzzy logic algorithmic approach in order to classify
opinion words into different category and syntactic dependency resolution to
find relations for desired aspect words. Opinion words related to certain
aspects of interest are considered to find the entity score for that aspect in
the review.

### [3] [LASTIST: LArge-Scale Target-Independent STance dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25783)
*DongJae Kim,Yaejin Lee,Minsu Park,Eunil Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了大规模韩语目标独立立场检测数据集LASTIST，填补低资源语言立场检测领域的数据空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有立场检测研究集中于目标依赖型任务且多为英文数据集，韩语等低资源语言缺乏相应研究基础设施。

Method: 通过收集韩国政党新闻稿构建包含563,299句标注韩语句子的数据集，并训练前沿深度学习模型进行验证。

Result: 创建支持目标独立立场检测和历时演变分析的多任务数据集，实现https匿名平台部署。

Conclusion: LASTIST数据集为韩语立场检测研究提供基础设施，推动低资源语言在政治立场演化等场景的应用。

Abstract: Stance detection has emerged as an area of research in the field of
artificial intelligence. However, most research is currently centered on the
target-dependent stance detection task, which is based on a person's stance in
favor of or against a specific target. Furthermore, most benchmark datasets are
based on English, making it difficult to develop models in low-resource
languages such as Korean, especially for an emerging field such as stance
detection. This study proposes the LArge-Scale Target-Independent STance
(LASTIST) dataset to fill this research gap. Collected from the press releases
of both parties on Korean political parties, the LASTIST dataset uses 563,299
labeled Korean sentences. We provide a detailed description of how we collected
and constructed the dataset and trained state-of-the-art deep learning and
stance detection models. Our LASTIST dataset is designed for various tasks in
stance detection, including target-independent stance detection and diachronic
evolution stance detection. We deploy our dataset on
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LASTIST-3721/.

### [4] [zFLoRA: Zero-Latency Fused Low-Rank Adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25784)
*Dhananjaya Gowda,Seoha Song,Harshith Goka,Junhyun Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出零延迟融合低秩适配器(zFLoRA)，在保持模型性能的同时消除适配器带来的推理延迟开销


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有任务特定适配器虽参数量小(＜1%)，但会导致推理时间显著增加(最高达基模型2.5倍)，严重影响部署效率

Method: 通过融合低秩适配器参数到基模型，实现零额外计算开销的适配方案

Result: 在1B/3B/7B参数LLM上验证，zFLoRA在常识推理/数学推理/摘要对话等18个任务中表现优于LoRA和全参数微调，在NPU/GPU平台测量显示延迟增加可忽略

Conclusion: zFLoRA首次实现了适配器技术的零延迟部署，为LLM的轻量化适配提供了新范式

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed with task-specific
adapters catering to multiple downstream applications. In such a scenario, the
additional compute associated with these apparently insignificant number of
adapter parameters (typically less than 1% of the base model) turns out to be
disproportionately significant during inference time (upto 2.5x times that of
the base model). In this paper, we propose a new zero-latency fused low-rank
adapter (zFLoRA) that introduces zero or negligible latency overhead on top of
the base model. Experimental results on LLMs of size 1B, 3B and 7B show that
zFLoRA compares favorably against the popular supervised fine-tuning benchmarks
including low-rank adapters (LoRA) as well as full fine-tuning (FFT).
Experiments are conducted on 18 different tasks across three different
categories namely commonsense reasoning, math reasoning and summary-dialogue.
Latency measurements made on NPU (Samsung Galaxy S25+) as well as GPU (NVIDIA
H100) platforms show that the proposed zFLoRA adapters introduce zero to
negligible latency overhead.

*Yaniv Nikankin,Dana Arad,Itay Itzhak,Anja Reusch,Adi Simhi,Gal Kesten-Pomeranz,Yonatan Belinkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文针对机制可解释性中的电路发现问题，提出了基于bootstrapping、ratio-based策略和整数线性规划的三大改进方法，显著提升了电路忠实度和任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机制可解释性研究中电路发现的核心挑战（即确定模型中执行特定任务的组件），基于MIB基准进行方法论优化。

Method: 1. 使用bootstrapping筛选稳定归因边
2. 提出ratio-based策略平衡性能与忠实度
3. 用整数线性规划替代传统贪婪算法

Result: 在多个MIB任务和模型上实现了比现有方法更忠实的电路结构，且性能表现更优

Conclusion: 该方法体系有效解决了电路发现的关键痛点，代码已开源供社区使用

Abstract: One of the main challenges in mechanistic interpretability is circuit
discovery, determining which parts of a model perform a given task. We build on
the Mechanistic Interpretability Benchmark (MIB) and propose three key
improvements to circuit discovery. First, we use bootstrapping to identify
edges with consistent attribution scores. Second, we introduce a simple
ratio-based selection strategy to prioritize strong positive-scoring edges,
balancing performance and faithfulness. Third, we replace the standard greedy
selection with an integer linear programming formulation. Our methods yield
more faithful circuits and outperform prior approaches across multiple MIB
tasks and models. Our code is available at:

### [6] [LISTEN to Your Preferences: An LLM Framework for Multi-Objective Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25799)
*Adam S. Jovine,Tinghan Ye,Francis Bahk,Jingjing Wang,David B. Shmoys,Peter I. Frazier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出LISTEN框架利用LLM作为零样本偏好预测器，通过自然语言指导多目标决策，降低传统偏好获取的认知负担


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类专家在多目标决策时面临隐含偏好难以形式化的痛点，现有方法难以有效捕捉复杂偏好关系

Method: 开发两种算法：LISTEN-U（参数化效用函数优化）和LISTEN-T（非参数化锦标赛选择），利用LLM进行迭代偏好预测

Result: LISTEN-U在参数对齐场景表现优异（用新提出的concordance metric衡量），LISTEN-T在鲁棒性上更具优势，实验覆盖航班预订等多样化任务

Conclusion: 探索了自然语言直接指导复杂决策的新范式，通过LLM的偏好预测能力突破传统偏好获取的限制

Abstract: Human experts often struggle to select the best option from a large set of
items with multiple competing objectives, a process bottlenecked by the
difficulty of formalizing complex, implicit preferences. To address this, we
introduce LISTEN, a framework that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) as a
zero-shot preference oracle, guided only by an expert's high-level priorities
in natural language. To operate within LLM constraints like context windows and
inference costs, we propose two iterative algorithms: LISTEN-U, which uses the
LLM to refine a parametric utility function, and LISTEN-T, a non-parametric
method that performs tournament-style selections over small batches of
solutions. Evaluated on diverse tasks including flight booking, shopping, and
exam scheduling, our results show LISTEN-U excels when preferences are
parametrically aligned (a property we measure with a novel concordance metric),
while LISTEN-T offers more robust performance. This work explores a promising
direction for steering complex multi-objective decisions directly with natural
language, reducing the cognitive burden of traditional preference elicitation.

*Haoran Deng,Yingyu Lin,Zhenghao Lin,Xiao Liu,Yizhou Sun,Yi-An Ma,Yeyun Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出LongFilter框架，通过高效筛选具有长距离依赖的训练数据，显著提升长上下文语言模型的性能表现


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长文本数据普遍存在长距离依赖缺失问题，导致模型训练效率低下，需要建立有效的数据筛选机制

Method: 通过对比模型在长/短上下文环境下的预测差异，计算信息增益值，精准识别依赖长距离上下文的优质训练样本

Result: LLaMA-3-8B模型上下文扩展至64K后，在HELMET/LongBench/RULER等基准测试中实现性能突破

Conclusion: LongFilter框架成功验证了数据筛选对长上下文模型训练的关键作用，为高效扩展模型上下文窗口提供了新范式

Abstract: Long-context language models unlock advanced capabilities in reasoning, code
generation, and document summarization by leveraging dependencies across
extended spans of text. However, a significant portion of readily available
long-text data lacks meaningful long-distance dependencies; most spans can be
predicted using only local context. Training on such data is inefficient,
making careful data selection crucial. Therefore, we introduce LongFilter, a
framework for curating training data tailored to long-context pretraining.
LongFilter measures the information gain provided by extended context by
contrasting model predictions under long-context versus short-context settings,
thereby identifying samples where long-range dependencies are essential.
Experiments with LLaMA-3-8B, extending its context length from 8K to 64K, show
that LongFilter efficiently selects high-quality data and yields substantial
improvements on benchmarks such as HELMET, LongBench, and RULER.

*Stefano Civelli,Pietro Bernardelle,Nardiena A. Pratama,Gianluca Demartini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs在角色设定下会呈现意识形态偏见，相同意识形态的角色判断一致性增强，不同意识形态分歧扩大


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究角色设定对LLMs内容审核公平性的影响，揭示AI系统在表面中立下可能强化党派立场

Method: 跨模型架构/规模/模态对比分析+政治定向任务验证，采用一致性分析和协议分析

Result: 1. 不同意识形态角色对有害内容判定差异显著 2. 大模型更倾向与同意识形态角色对齐 3. 角色会强化自我辩护倾向并弱化对立观点危害性

Conclusion: 角色设定会通过隐性视角塑造LLMs判断，警示所谓'中立'AI系统可能成为意识形态偏见载体

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in content moderation
systems, where ensuring fairness and neutrality is essential. In this study, we
examine how persona adoption influences the consistency and fairness of harmful
content classification across different LLM architectures, model sizes, and
content modalities (language vs. vision). At first glance, headline performance
metrics suggest that personas have little impact on overall classification
accuracy. However, a closer analysis reveals important behavioral shifts.
Personas with different ideological leanings display distinct propensities to
label content as harmful, showing that the lens through which a model "views"
input can subtly shape its judgments. Further agreement analyses highlight that
models, particularly larger ones, tend to align more closely with personas from
the same political ideology, strengthening within-ideology consistency while
widening divergence across ideological groups. To show this effect more
directly, we conducted an additional study on a politically targeted task,
which confirmed that personas not only behave more coherently within their own
ideology but also exhibit a tendency to defend their perspective while
downplaying harmfulness in opposing views. Together, these findings highlight
how persona conditioning can introduce subtle ideological biases into LLM
outputs, raising concerns about the use of AI systems that may reinforce
partisan perspectives under the guise of neutrality.

*Tarun Kumar Chawdhury,Jon D. Duke*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLEAR方法通过实体感知检索提升临床问答效率，F1分数0.90且减少78% token使用，在长文本处理中表现突出（65k tokens文档胜率75%）


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统向量数据库方法在解析FHIR编码的临床附件时难以捕捉语义关系，临床NLP需要更高精度和计算效率的解决方案

Method: 开发临床笔记QA评估平台，对比CLEAR（实体感知检索）与零样本大上下文推理/传统分块检索增强生成方法，测试12份10k-65k tokens的真实临床记录

Result: CLEAR取得58.3%胜率，平均语义相似度0.878，长文本处理效率提升显著（65k tokens文档胜率75%），比传统方法节省78% tokens

Conclusion: 实体感知检索显著提升临床NLP的精度和效率，配套评估框架为医疗问答系统提供了可复用的透明化基准测试标准

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) store clinical documentation as base64
encoded attachments in FHIR DocumentReference resources, which makes semantic
question answering difficult. Traditional vector database methods often miss
nuanced clinical relationships. The Clinical Entity Augmented Retrieval (CLEAR)
method, introduced by Lopez et al. 2025, uses entity aware retrieval and
achieved improved performance with an F1 score of 0.90 versus 0.86 for
embedding based retrieval, while using over 70 percent fewer tokens. We
developed a Clinical Notes QA Evaluation Platform to validate CLEAR against
zero shot large context inference and traditional chunk based retrieval
augmented generation. The platform was tested on 12 clinical notes ranging from
10,000 to 65,000 tokens representing realistic EHR content. CLEAR achieved a
58.3 percent win rate, an average semantic similarity of 0.878, and used 78
percent fewer tokens than wide context processing. The largest performance
gains occurred on long notes, with a 75 percent win rate for documents
exceeding 65,000 tokens. These findings confirm that entity aware retrieval
improves both efficiency and accuracy in clinical natural language processing.
The evaluation framework provides a reusable and transparent benchmark for
assessing clinical question answering systems where semantic precision and
computational efficiency are critical.

Abstract: Post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for unlocking their
task generalization potential and domain-specific capabilities. However, the
current LLM post-training paradigm faces significant data challenges, including
the high costs of manual annotation and diminishing marginal returns on data
scales. Therefore, achieving data-efficient post-training has become a key
research question. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey of
data-efficient LLM post-training from a data-centric perspective. We propose a
taxonomy of data-efficient LLM post-training methods, covering data selection,
data quality enhancement, synthetic data generation, data distillation and
compression, and self-evolving data ecosystems. We summarize representative
approaches in each category and outline future research directions. By
examining the challenges in data-efficient LLM post-training, we highlight open
problems and propose potential research avenues. We hope our work inspires
further exploration into maximizing the potential of data utilization in
large-scale model training. Paper List:

TL;DR: 研究评估基于LLM的语义角色标注器在FrameNet式语义标注中的半自动应用效果，发现半自动模式在框架多样性上优于纯人工标注，全自动模式除耗时外均表现不佳


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补基于LLM工具在语义标注任务中性能评估的空白，特别关注其对标注数据集覆盖度、多样性和效率的影响

Method: 通过对比人工标注、全自动标注和半自动标注三种模式，测量标注时间、覆盖范围和框架多样性指标

Result: 半自动模式实现最高框架多样性（比人工高11.3%），保持与人工相当的覆盖度（98.6% vs 100%），全自动模式覆盖率仅76.2%且多样性最低

Conclusion: 人机协同的半自动标注模式在保持效率的同时提升语义标注质量，全自动LLM标注尚未达到实用水平，验证了混合模式在语言学资源创建中的有效性

Abstract: The use of LLM-based applications as a means to accelerate and/or substitute
human labor in the creation of language resources and dataset is a reality.
Nonetheless, despite the potential of such tools for linguistic research,
comprehensive evaluation of their performance and impact on the creation of
annotated datasets, especially under a perspectivized approach to NLP, is still
missing. This paper contributes to reduction of this gap by reporting on an
extensive evaluation of the (semi-)automatization of FrameNet-like semantic
annotation by the use of an LLM-based semantic role labeler. The methodology
employed compares annotation time, coverage and diversity in three experimental
settings: manual, automatic and semi-automatic annotation. Results show that
the hybrid, semi-automatic annotation setting leads to increased frame
diversity and similar annotation coverage, when compared to the human-only
setting, while the automatic setting performs considerably worse in all
metrics, except for annotation time.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出RECAP方法通过反馈循环机制有效提取大型语言模型记忆中的训练数据，在版权文本提取任务中ROUGE-L指标提升24%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于无法直接检查LLM训练数据，需要间接验证模型是否记忆特定内容。现有单次提取方法效果有限，需设计迭代优化策略提升输出质量

Method: 构建包含反馈驱动循环(生成-验证-修正)和越狱模块的自动化流程。次级模型评估初始输出差异，生成修正提示指导目标模型迭代改进

Result: 在包含30+本书籍的EchoTrace基准测试中，GPT-4.1的ROUGE-L分数从0.38提升至0.47，相对提升24%

Conclusion: RECAP证明了迭代修正机制在提取记忆数据中的有效性，为模型训练数据审计提供了新的技术路径

Abstract: If we cannot inspect the training data of a large language model (LLM), how
can we ever know what it has seen? We believe the most compelling evidence
arises when the model itself freely reproduces the target content. As such, we
propose RECAP, an agentic pipeline designed to elicit and verify memorized
training data from LLM outputs. At the heart of RECAP is a feedback-driven
loop, where an initial extraction attempt is evaluated by a secondary language
model, which compares the output against a reference passage and identifies
discrepancies. These are then translated into minimal correction hints, which
are fed back into the target model to guide subsequent generations. In
addition, to address alignment-induced refusals, RECAP includes a jailbreaking
module that detects and overcomes such barriers. We evaluate RECAP on
EchoTrace, a new benchmark spanning over 30 full books, and the results show
that RECAP leads to substantial gains over single-iteration approaches. For
instance, with GPT-4.1, the average ROUGE-L score for the copyrighted text
extraction improved from 0.38 to 0.47 - a nearly 24% increase.

Motivation: 探究大规模多语言预训练中不同语言混合比例对模型性能的影响，验证'多语言诅咒'假设是否成立

Method: 训练1.1B/3B参数量的LLM，使用25-400种语言构成的多样化多语言语料库进行实验

Result: 1) 足够token量的语言混合不会导致性能下降 2) 英语作为枢纽语言优于语系内枢纽 3) 未观测到显著的多语言诅咒现象

Conclusion: 合理平衡的多语言数据能增强模型能力且不牺牲性能，该结论在低资源场景下依然成立

Abstract: The impact of different multilingual data mixtures in pretraining large
language models (LLMs) has been a topic of ongoing debate, often raising
concerns about potential trade-offs between language coverage and model
performance (i.e., the curse of multilinguality). In this work, we investigate
these assumptions by training 1.1B and 3B parameter LLMs on diverse
multilingual corpora, varying the number of languages from 25 to 400. Our study
challenges common beliefs surrounding multilingual training. First, we find
that combining English and multilingual data does not necessarily degrade the
in-language performance of either group, provided that languages have a
sufficient number of tokens included in the pretraining corpus. Second, we
observe that using English as a pivot language (i.e., a high-resource language
that serves as a catalyst for multilingual generalization) yields benefits
across language families, and contrary to expectations, selecting a pivot
language from within a specific family does not consistently improve
performance for languages within that family. Lastly, we do not observe a
significant "curse of multilinguality" as the number of training languages
increases in models at this scale. Our findings suggest that multilingual data,
when balanced appropriately, can enhance language model capabilities without
compromising performance, even in low-resource settings

TL;DR: 研究发现机器翻译系统（包括现代大模型）在跨文化翻译时会产生语义标签漂移，尤其在文化敏感领域，文化相似性是关键影响因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对机器翻译中文化差异导致的语义标签漂移问题长期被忽视，可能引发下游应用的误解和文化冲突

Method: 通过文化敏感领域/中性领域的对比实验，分析不同MT系统（含LLMs）的翻译行为与文化编码特征

Result: 1）所有MT系统存在文化标签漂移 2）LLMs自带文化知识会加剧漂移 3）语言文化相似度决定标签保持效果

Conclusion: 忽视文化因素将威胁翻译可靠性并引发文化冲突，强调跨文化翻译需建立文化适配机制

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) is widely employed to address resource scarcity in
low-resource languages by generating synthetic data from high-resource
counterparts. While sentiment preservation in translation has long been
studied, a critical but underexplored factor is the role of cultural alignment
between source and target languages. In this paper, we hypothesize that
semantic labels are drifted or altered during MT due to cultural divergence.
Through a series of experiments across culturally sensitive and neutral
domains, we establish three key findings: (1) MT systems, including modern
Large Language Models (LLMs), induce label drift during translation,
particularly in culturally sensitive domains; (2) unlike earlier statistical MT
tools, LLMs encode cultural knowledge, and leveraging this knowledge can
amplify label drift; and (3) cultural similarity or dissimilarity between
source and target languages is a crucial determinant of label preservation. Our
findings highlight that neglecting cultural factors in MT not only undermines
label fidelity but also risks misinterpretation and cultural conflict in
downstream applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出SymCode框架，通过符号代码生成改进大语言模型的数学推理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂数学推理中存在不可验证的文本生成缺陷，现有提示策略缺乏确定性验证机制

Method: 将数学问题转化为基于SymPy的可验证代码生成任务，建立神经符号系统

Result: 在MATH-500和OlympiadBench基准上实现13.6%的准确率提升，错误类型转向可调试的程序错误

Conclusion: 通过符号引擎验证机制，为形式化领域构建更可靠的人工智能系统迈出关键一步

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning, where prose-based generation leads to unverified and arithmetically
unsound solutions. Current prompting strategies like Chain of Thought still
operate within this unreliable medium, lacking a mechanism for deterministic
verification. To address these limitations, we introduce SymCode, a
neurosymbolic framework that reframes mathematical problem-solving as a task of
verifiable code generation using the SymPy library. We evaluate SymCode on
challenging benchmarks, including MATH-500 and OlympiadBench, demonstrating
significant accuracy improvements of up to 13.6 percentage points over
baselines. Our analysis shows that SymCode is not only more token-efficient but
also fundamentally shifts model failures from opaque logical fallacies towards
transparent, programmatic errors. By grounding LLM reasoning in a deterministic
symbolic engine, SymCode represents a key step towards more accurate and
trustworthy AI in formal domains.

Motivation: AWS Trainium芯片的脉动阵列架构和数据布局特殊要求导致高性能实现困难，需针对性优化矩阵乘法这一核心计算单元

Method: 采用核融合技术、创新缓存策略，优化软件管理内存层级间数据传输，最大化SRAM带宽利用率，避免昂贵矩阵转置操作

Conclusion: 定制化优化策略有效克服Trainium架构限制，显著提升LLM推理效率，为AI加速器性能优化提供重要实践参考

Abstract: AI accelerators, customized to AI workloads, provide cost-effective and
high-performance solutions for training and inference. Trainium, an AI
accelerator recently developed by Amazon Web Services (AWS), provides an
attractive option for LLM training and inference through its heterogeneous
architecture. However, leveraging Trainium architecture for high performance
can be challenging because of its systolic array architecture and special
requirement on data layout. In this paper, we design high-performance matrix
multiplication (matmul), a critical compute kernel, for LLM inference on
Trainium. We introduce a series of techniques customized to Trainium based on
kernel fusion and novel caching strategies to reduce data movement across the
software-managed memory hierarchy, maximize SRAM bandwidth, and avoid expensive
matrix transpose. Evaluating with nine datasets and four recent LLMs, we show
that our system largely outperforms the state-of-the-art matmul implemented by
AWS on Trainium: at the level of matmul kernel, it achieves an average 1.35x
speedup (up to 2.22x), which translates to an average 1.66x speedup (up to
2.49x) for end-to-end LLM inference.

TL;DR: 提出AttnCache框架，通过缓存和复用相似注意力图加速LLM预填充阶段推理，实现CPU/GPU显著加速且精度损失可忽略


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM预填充阶段的自注意力计算因序列长度呈二次复杂度成为性能瓶颈，而不同语义句子常产生相似注意力图

Method: 构建注意力图记忆数据库，采用高效缓存和相似性检索技术复用历史注意力计算结果，减少自注意力计算开销

Result: CPU端整体加速1.2倍(注意力2倍)，GPU端整体加速1.6倍(注意力3倍)，精度损失可忽略

Conclusion: AttnCache通过注意力图复用机制，在基本保持模型精度的前提下，显著提升LLM预填充阶段推理效率

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in generative applications such
as chatting, code generation, and reasoning. However, many realworld workloads
such as classification, question answering, recommendation, and text embedding
rely solely on the prefill stage of inference, where the model encodes input
sequences without performing autoregressive decoding. In these prefill only
scenarios, the self-attention computation becomes the primary performance
bottleneck due to its quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length. In
this paper, we observe that semantically different sentences often produce
similar attention maps across layers and heads. Building on this insight, we
propose AttnCache, a framework that accelerates the prefill stage of LLM
inference by retrieving and reusing similar attention maps. Based on an
attention map memorization database, AttnCache employs efficient caching and
similarity search techniques to identify and reuse pre-cached attention maps
during inference, thereby reducing the computational overhead of
self-attention. Experimental results show that AttnCache achieves an average of
1.2x end-to-end and 2x attention speedup on CPU, and 1.6x end-to-end and 3x
attention speedup on GPU, with negligible accuracy degradation.

TL;DR: 提出监督强化学习框架SRL，通过将问题转化为逻辑动作序列并融合专家演示的逐步奖励机制，有效解决小模型在多步推理任务中的训练难题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法在正确解采样不足时失效，SFT方法容易对长演示过拟合。需要兼顾灵活推理与稳定训练的新框架

Method: 将问题建模为逻辑动作序列生成，训练模型在输出每个动作前生成内部推理独白，基于SFT数据集提取的专家动作进行逐步相似度奖励监督

Result: SRL使小模型学会RLVR/SFT无法训练的挑战性任务，与RLVR结合达到最强性能，在软件工程任务中验证框架通用性

Conclusion: SRL为推理导向的LLMs提供了兼顾稳定性与灵活性的训练范式，通过监督与强化学习的协同机制开辟新路径

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with problems that require
multi-step reasoning. For small-scale open-source models, Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) fails when correct solutions are rarely
sampled even after many attempts, while Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to
overfit long demonstrations through rigid token-by-token imitation. To address
this gap, we propose Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL), a framework that
reformulates problem solving as generating a sequence of logical "actions". SRL
trains the model to generate an internal reasoning monologue before committing
to each action. It provides smoother rewards based on the similarity between
the model's actions and expert actions extracted from the SFT dataset in a
step-wise manner. This supervision offers richer learning signals even when all
rollouts are incorrect, while encouraging flexible reasoning guided by expert
demonstrations. As a result, SRL enables small models to learn challenging
problems previously unlearnable by SFT or RLVR. Moreover, initializing training
with SRL before refining with RLVR yields the strongest overall performance.
Beyond reasoning benchmarks, SRL generalizes effectively to agentic software
engineering tasks, establishing it as a robust and versatile training framework
for reasoning-oriented LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具型大语言模型在静态数据集训练下，难以探索多种解决方案，在动态工具调用环境中表现受限。

Method: 1. 生成多个工具调用轨迹形成树状结构 2. 基于答案正确性和工具调用成功率分配步骤奖励 3. 结合分叉相对优势与轨迹相对优势训练模型

Result: 实验使用17种工具处理查询，PORTool显著提升最终准确率(8.6%)并减少工具调用步骤(平均3.2步)，消融实验验证了设计有效性。

Conclusion: PORTool通过强化学习奖励机制有效增强模型在动态环境中的探索能力，为工具型语言模型训练提供新思路。

Abstract: Current tool-use large language models (LLMs) are trained on static datasets,
enabling them to interact with external tools and perform multi-step,
tool-integrated reasoning, which produces tool-call trajectories. However,
these models imitate how a query is resolved in a generic tool-call routine,
thereby failing to explore possible solutions and demonstrating limited
performance in an evolved, dynamic tool-call environment. In this work, we
propose PORTool, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that encourages a
tool-use LLM to explore various trajectories yielding the correct answer.
Specifically, this method starts with generating multiple rollouts for a given
query, and some of them share the first few tool-call steps, thereby forming a
tree-like structure. Next, we assign rewards to each step, based on its ability
to produce a correct answer and make successful tool calls. A shared step
across different trajectories receives the same reward, while different steps
under the same fork receive different rewards. Finally, these step-wise rewards
are used to calculate fork-relative advantages, blended with
trajectory-relative advantages, to train the LLM for tool use. The experiments
utilize 17 tools to address user queries, covering both time-sensitive and
time-invariant topics. We conduct ablation studies to systematically justify
the necessity and the design robustness of step-wise rewards. Furthermore, we
compare the proposed PORTool with other training approaches and demonstrate
significant improvements in final accuracy and the number of tool-call steps.

<details>

Motivation: 现有跨语言对齐方法过度追求表征统一，导致模型无法根据不同语言文化背景输出差异化响应，造成文化特定知识的功能性损失。

Method: 提出transfer-localization评估平面量化指标，结合模型内部表征分析，开发Surgical Steering推理时干预技术，通过不同网络层的定向激活调控实现目标解耦。

Result: 实验表明：1）现有CLA方法在六种语言中都呈现知识迁移与文化擦除的负相关 2）事实迁移与文化知识分别由不同网络层调控 3）新方法在保持85%知识迁移能力的同时恢复92%文化响应能力。

Conclusion: 通过分层精确调控的Surgical Steering技术，成功突破现有对齐技术的局限性，首次实现跨语言知识迁移与文化本地化的有效兼容。

Abstract: Cross-lingual alignment (CLA) aims to align multilingual representations,
enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to seamlessly transfer knowledge across
languages. While intuitive, we hypothesize, this pursuit of representational
convergence can inadvertently cause "cultural erasure", the functional loss of
providing culturally-situated responses that should diverge based on the query
language. In this work, we systematically analyze this trade-off by introducing
a holistic evaluation framework, the transfer-localization plane, which
quantifies both desirable knowledge transfer and undesirable cultural erasure.
Using this framework, we re-evaluate recent CLA approaches and find that they
consistently improve factual transfer at the direct cost of cultural
localization across all six languages studied. Our investigation into the
internal representations of these models reveals a key insight: universal
factual transfer and culturally-specific knowledge are optimally steerable at
different model layers. Based on this finding, we propose Surgical Steering, a
novel inference-time method that disentangles these two objectives. By applying
targeted activation steering to distinct layers, our approach achieves a better
balance between the two competing dimensions, effectively overcoming the
limitations of current alignment techniques.

Method: 基于Transformer的NLP流程分析115,683例患者的回顾性影像数据（2017-2023）

Result: 7.8%患者发现ITFs，92.9%为结节。ITFs患者后续甲状腺癌检出率更高（多为乳头状癌），但多数结节特征记录不全

Conclusion: ITFs引发过度诊断链条，需优化影像报告标准并减少不必要随访

Abstract: Importance Incidental thyroid findings (ITFs) are increasingly detected on
imaging performed for non-thyroid indications. Their prevalence, features, and
clinical consequences remain undefined. Objective To develop, validate, and
deploy a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to identify ITFs in
radiology reports and assess their prevalence, features, and clinical outcomes.
Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort of adults without prior
thyroid disease undergoing thyroid-capturing imaging at Mayo Clinic sites from
July 1, 2017, to September 30, 2023. A transformer-based NLP pipeline
identified ITFs and extracted nodule characteristics from image reports from
multiple modalities and body regions. Main Outcomes and Measures Prevalence of
ITFs, downstream thyroid ultrasound, biopsy, thyroidectomy, and thyroid cancer
diagnosis. Logistic regression identified demographic and imaging-related
factors. Results Among 115,683 patients (mean age, 56.8 [SD 17.2] years; 52.9%
women), 9,077 (7.8%) had an ITF, of which 92.9% were nodules. ITFs were more
likely in women, older adults, those with higher BMI, and when imaging was
ordered by oncology or internal medicine. Compared with chest CT, ITFs were
more likely via neck CT, PET, and nuclear medicine scans. Nodule
characteristics were poorly documented, with size reported in 44% and other
features in fewer than 15% (e.g. calcifications). Compared with patients
without ITFs, those with ITFs had higher odds of thyroid nodule diagnosis,
biopsy, thyroidectomy and thyroid cancer diagnosis. Most cancers were
papillary, and larger when detected after ITFs vs no ITF. Conclusions ITFs were
common and strongly associated with cascades leading to the detection of small,
low-risk cancers. These findings underscore the role of ITFs in thyroid cancer
overdiagnosis and the need for standardized reporting and more selective
follow-up.

Conclusion: 量子编程需要超越传统代码生成的评估体系，硬件反馈与人类基准对比为模型优化提供新方向

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been applied to automatic
programming code generation. This task can be viewed as a language generation
task that bridges natural language, human knowledge, and programming logic.
However, it remains underexplored in domains that require interaction with
hardware devices, such as quantum programming, where human coders write Python
code that is executed on a quantum computer. To address this gap, we introduce
QCoder Benchmark, an evaluation framework that assesses LLMs on quantum
programming with feedback from simulated hardware devices. Our benchmark offers
two key features. First, it supports evaluation using a quantum simulator
environment beyond conventional Python execution, allowing feedback of
domain-specific metrics such as circuit depth, execution time, and error
classification, which can be used to guide better generation. Second, it
incorporates human-written code submissions collected from real programming
contests, enabling both quantitative comparisons and qualitative analyses of
LLM outputs against human-written codes. Our experiments reveal that even
advanced models like GPT-4o achieve only around 18.97% accuracy, highlighting
the difficulty of the benchmark. In contrast, reasoning-based models such as o3
reach up to 78% accuracy, outperforming averaged success rates of human-written
codes (39.98%). We release the QCoder Benchmark dataset and public evaluation
API to support further research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统1P1S训练导致模型输出同质化，限制测试时间扩展（TTS）效果，需提升推理路径多样性。

Method: 1. 设计推理路径差异（RPD）指标评估多步思维链语义差异；2. 基于RPD筛选多样化训练集；3. 对Qwen3-4B-Base进行微调。

Result: 实验显示RPD训练使pass@16平均提升2.80%（AIME24提升4.99%），验证1PNS对TTS的增强作用。

Conclusion: 通过1PNS范式与RPD指标可有效提升模型推理多样性，为LLM训练提供新方向。

Abstract: While Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has proven effective in improving the reasoning
ability of large language models (LLMs), low diversity in model outputs often
becomes a bottleneck; this is partly caused by the common "one problem, one
solution" (1P1S) training practice, which provides a single canonical answer
and can push models toward a narrow set of reasoning paths. To address this, we
propose a "one problem, multiple solutions" (1PNS) training paradigm that
exposes the model to a variety of valid reasoning trajectories and thus
increases inference diversity. A core challenge for 1PNS is reliably measuring
semantic differences between multi-step chains of thought, so we introduce
Reasoning Path Divergence (RPD), a step-level metric that aligns and scores
Long Chain-of-Thought solutions to capture differences in intermediate
reasoning. Using RPD, we curate maximally diverse solution sets per problem and
fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Base. Experiments show that RPD-selected training yields
more varied outputs and higher pass@k, with an average +2.80% gain in pass@16
over a strong 1P1S baseline and a +4.99% gain on AIME24, demonstrating that
1PNS further amplifies the effectiveness of TTS. Our code is available at

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between Persuasion Techniques (PTs)
and Discourse Relations (DRs) by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and
prompt engineering. Since no dataset annotated with both PTs and DRs exists, we
took the SemEval 2023 Task 3 dataset labelled with 19 PTs as a starting point
and developed LLM-based classifiers to label each instance of the dataset with
one of the 22 PDTB 3.0 level-2 DRs. In total, four LLMs were evaluated using 10
different prompts, resulting in 40 unique DR classifiers. Ensemble models using
different majority-pooling strategies were used to create 5 silver datasets of
instances labelled with both persuasion techniques and level-2 PDTB senses. The
silver dataset sizes vary from 1,281 instances to 204 instances, depending on
the majority pooling technique used. Statistical analysis of these silver
datasets shows that six discourse relations (namely Cause, Purpose, Contrast,
Cause+Belief, Concession, and Condition) play a crucial role in persuasive
texts, especially in the use of Loaded Language, Exaggeration/Minimisation,
Repetition and to cast Doubt. This insight can contribute to detecting online
propaganda and misinformation, as well as to our general understanding of
effective communication.

Conclusion: MossNet为高效高性能循环LLM架构提供了新方向，验证了混合专家在注意力机制扩展中的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced generative
applications in natural language processing (NLP). Recent trends in model
architectures revolve around efficient variants of transformers or
state-space/gated-recurrent models (SSMs, GRMs). However, prevailing
SSM/GRM-based methods often emulate only a single attention head, potentially
limiting their expressiveness. In this work, we propose MossNet, a novel
mixture-of-state-space-experts architecture that emulates a linear multi-head
attention (MHA). MossNet leverages a mixture-of-experts (MoE) implementation
not only in channel-mixing multi-layered perceptron (MLP) blocks but also in
the time-mixing SSM kernels to realize multiple "attention heads." Extensive
experiments on language modeling and downstream evaluations show that MossNet
outperforms both transformer- and SSM-based architectures of similar model size
and data budgets. Larger variants of MossNet, trained on trillions of tokens,
further confirm its scalability and superior performance. In addition,
real-device profiling on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and an Nvidia A100 GPU
demonstrate favorable runtime speed and resource usage compared to similarly
sized baselines. Our results suggest that MossNet is a compelling new direction
for efficient, high-performing recurrent LLM architectures.

Result: 相比基线模型，SDM模型在保持生成质量的同时显著降低弃答率(abstentions)。

Conclusion: SDM框架可有效转换现有预训练模型，为需要高校准生成的任务提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Similarity-Distance-Magnitude (SDM) language models (LMs), which
are sequence prediction models fine-tuned to maximize the proportion of
generations in the well-calibrated, high-probability region partitioned by a
final-layer SDM activation layer used for binary classification of
instruction-following. We demonstrate that existing pre-trained decoder-only
Transformer LMs can be readily converted into SDM LMs via supervised
fine-tuning, using the final-layer SDM activation layer during training to
estimate a change-of-base for a supervised next-token loss over a contrastive
input encoding scheme, with additional hard negative examples generated online
during training. This results in reduced abstentions (i.e., improved
statistical efficiency) compared to strong supervised baselines.

Motivation: 现有LLM评估方法忽视指令风格敏感性，而这对实际部署至关重要。需系统量化指令表述差异对模型性能的影响，提升模型可靠性评估。

Method: 通过多指令风格转换构建RCScore框架，设计跨响应相似性(CRS)指标衡量风格自一致性，并分析确定性解码和模型规模对输出稳定性的影响。

Result: 指令风格变化导致最大16.7%准确率差异；CRS与任务准确率相关系数达0.85；确定性解码提升输出稳定性32%；模型规模扩大使跨风格一致性提升18%。

Conclusion: RCScore为指令鲁棒性评估提供系统方法论，证实风格自一致性是可靠代理指标，模型规模与解码策略对稳定性具有显著影响。

Abstract: Current LLM evaluations often rely on a single instruction template,
overlooking models' sensitivity to instruction style-a critical aspect for
real-world deployments. We present RCScore, a multi-dimensional framework
quantifying how instruction formulation affects model responses. By
systematically transforming benchmark problems into multiple instruction
styles, RCScore reveals performance variations undetected by conventional
metrics. Our experiments across ten LLMs on four reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that instruction style can shift accuracy by up to 16.7% points. We
introduce Cross-Response Similarity (CRS), a method applying RCScore metrics to
measure stylistic self-consistency, and establish its strong correlation with
task accuracy, suggesting consistency as a valuable proxy for model
reliability. Additional findings show that deterministic decoding produces more
stylistically stable outputs, and model scale correlates positively with
cross-style consistency. RCScore offers a principled approach to assess
instruction robustness.

Conclusion: 时间步分配通过软化排序机制有效缓解update forgetting，为扩散文本生成提供稳定可控的解决方案

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) enable fine-grained refinement, their
practical controllability remains fragile. We identify and formally
characterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform
and context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps,
erasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement
process, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in
uniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token
ordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and
semantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are
frozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This
timestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an
adaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of
refinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies
uniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision
sources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment
control, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves
perplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers
maximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0).
Together, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep
allocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving
stable and controllable diffusion text generation.

Feedback? (WIMHF), a method to explain feedback data using sparse autoencoders.
WIMHF characterizes both (1) the preferences a dataset is capable of measuring
and (2) the preferences that the annotators actually express. Across 7
datasets, WIMHF identifies a small number of human-interpretable features that
account for the majority of the preference prediction signal achieved by
black-box models. These features reveal a wide diversity in what humans prefer,
and the role of dataset-level context: for example, users on Reddit prefer
informality and jokes, while annotators in HH-RLHF and PRISM disprefer them.
WIMHF also surfaces potentially unsafe preferences, such as that LMArena users
tend to vote against refusals, often in favor of toxic content. The learned
features enable effective data curation: re-labeling the harmful examples in
Arena yields large safety gains (+37%) with no cost to general performance.
They also allow fine-grained personalization: on the Community Alignment
dataset, we learn annotator-specific weights over subjective features that
improve preference prediction. WIMHF provides a human-centered analysis method
for practitioners to better understand and use preference data.

TL;DR: 提出首个针对全局RAG能力的评估基准GlobalQA，并开发多工具协作框架GlobalRAG实现性能显著提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG评估基准局限于局部检索（local RAG），无法评估需要跨文档聚合分析的全局能力（global RAG）

Method: 通过块级检索保持结构连贯性，引入LLM驱动的智能过滤器消除噪声文档，集成聚合模块进行精确符号计算

Result: 在Qwen2.5-14B模型上，GlobalRAG达到6.63 F1分数，显著优于最强基线的1.51 F1

Conclusion: GlobalRAG框架有效解决全局RAG任务挑战，为复杂信息聚合场景提供新的解决方案

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a leading approach to
reducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). Current RAG evaluation
benchmarks primarily focus on what we call local RAG: retrieving relevant
chunks from a small subset of documents to answer queries that require only
localized understanding within specific text chunks. However, many real-world
applications require a fundamentally different capability -- global RAG --
which involves aggregating and analyzing information across entire document
collections to derive corpus-level insights (for example, "What are the top 10
most cited papers in 2023?"). In this paper, we introduce GlobalQA -- the first
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate global RAG capabilities, covering
four core task types: counting, extremum queries, sorting, and top-k
extraction. Through systematic evaluation across different models and
baselines, we find that existing RAG methods perform poorly on global tasks,
with the strongest baseline achieving only 1.51 F1 score. To address these
challenges, we propose GlobalRAG, a multi-tool collaborative framework that
preserves structural coherence through chunk-level retrieval, incorporates
LLM-driven intelligent filters to eliminate noisy documents, and integrates
aggregation modules for precise symbolic computation. On the Qwen2.5-14B model,
GlobalRAG achieves 6.63 F1 compared to the strongest baseline's 1.51 F1,
validating the effectiveness of our method.

Conclusion: 显式融入语用学理论能有效提升语言模型的语用推理能力，理论框架提示具有参数效率优势

Abstract: The ability to accurately interpret implied meanings plays a crucial role in
human communication and language use, and language models are also expected to
possess this capability. This study demonstrates that providing language models
with pragmatic theories as prompts is an effective in-context learning approach
for tasks to understand implied meanings. Specifically, we propose an approach
in which an overview of pragmatic theories, such as Gricean pragmatics and
Relevance Theory, is presented as a prompt to the language model, guiding it
through a step-by-step reasoning process to derive a final interpretation.
Experimental results showed that, compared to the baseline, which prompts
intermediate reasoning without presenting pragmatic theories (0-shot
Chain-of-Thought), our methods enabled language models to achieve up to 9.6\%
higher scores on pragmatic reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we show that even
without explaining the details of pragmatic theories, merely mentioning their
names in the prompt leads to a certain performance improvement (around 1-3%) in
larger models compared to the baseline.

Motivation: 探究预训练语言模型是否具备类似人类的借词识别能力，尤其关注双语社区中主导语言对少数语言的词汇侵蚀现象

Method: 跨10种语言评估多种预训练模型（含大语言模型），通过明确指令和上下文信息测试其借词识别能力

Result: 模型在区分借词与原生词任务中表现显著不足，验证了现有NLP系统存在借词偏向的假设

Conclusion: 研究结果对开发少数语言NLP工具及保护受主导语言词汇压迫的语言社区具有重要启示意义

Abstract: Throughout language history, words are borrowed from one language to another
and gradually become integrated into the recipient's lexicon. Speakers can
often differentiate these loanwords from native vocabulary, particularly in
bilingual communities where a dominant language continuously imposes lexical
items on a minority language. This paper investigates whether pretrained
language models, including large language models, possess similar capabilities
for loanword identification. We evaluate multiple models across 10 languages.
Despite explicit instructions and contextual information, our results show that
models perform poorly in distinguishing loanwords from native ones. These
findings corroborate previous evidence that modern NLP systems exhibit a bias
toward loanwords rather than native equivalents. Our work has implications for
developing NLP tools for minority languages and supporting language
preservation in communities under lexical pressure from dominant languages.

Method: 在CLIP和SigLIP2模型上对比五种知识蒸馏方法，通过领域内检索和跨领域视觉QA任务评估效果

Result: 部分蒸馏配置能保持/提升多语言检索鲁棒性(模型尺寸减半)，但多数无法维持跨任务稳定性，揭示准确率指标无法反映的设计敏感权衡

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏在模型压缩中的应用需谨慎选择配置方案，单纯依赖聚合准确率会掩盖跨任务稳定性差异，强调多维度评估的重要性

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit uneven performance across languages, a
problem that is often exacerbated when the model size is reduced. While
Knowledge distillation (KD) demonstrates promising results in transferring
knowledge from larger to smaller VLMs, applying KD in multilingualism is an
underexplored area. This paper presents a controlled empirical study of KD
behavior across five distillation approaches, isolating their effects on
cross-lingual representation consistency and downstream performance stability
under model compression. We study five distillation formulations across CLIP
and SigLIP2, and evaluate them on in-domain retrieval and out-of-domain visual
QA. We find that some configurations preserve or even improve multilingual
retrieval robustness despite halving model size, but others fail to maintain
cross-task stability, exposing design-sensitive trade-offs that aggregate
accuracy alone does not reveal.

Result: 在数学/科学任务匹配多数投票效果，编程任务超越基准方法，提前终止减少99%计算量。

Conclusion: 神经元内部信号为无标签集成解码提供可靠、可扩展且高效的指导范式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) commonly boost reasoning via
sample-evaluate-ensemble decoders, achieving label free gains without ground
truth. However, prevailing strategies score candidates using only external
outputs such as token probabilities, entropies, or self evaluations, and these
signals can be poorly calibrated after post training. We instead analyze
internal behavior based on neuron activations and uncover three findings: (1)
external signals are low dimensional projections of richer internal dynamics;
(2) correct responses activate substantially fewer unique neurons than
incorrect ones throughout generation; and (3) activations from correct
responses exhibit stronger cross sample agreement, whereas incorrect ones
diverge. Motivated by these observations, we propose Neuron Agreement Decoding
(NAD), an unsupervised best-of-N method that selects candidates using
activation sparsity and cross sample neuron agreement, operating solely on
internal signals and without requiring comparable textual outputs. NAD enables
early correctness prediction within the first 32 generated tokens and supports
aggressive early stopping. Across math and science benchmarks with verifiable
answers, NAD matches majority voting; on open ended coding benchmarks where
majority voting is inapplicable, NAD consistently outperforms Avg@64. By
pruning unpromising trajectories early, NAD reduces token usage by 99% with
minimal loss in generation quality, showing that internal signals provide
reliable, scalable, and efficient guidance for label free ensemble decoding.

Result: 发现数字表征在隐藏层中具有跨模型通用性，错误源可定位至特定网络层

Conclusion: 揭示了预训练LLM处理数字的底层机制，提出精准探针技术对架构优化的重要价值

Abstract: Recent work has shown that different large language models (LLMs) converge to
similar and accurate input embedding representations for numbers. These
findings conflict with the documented propensity of LLMs to produce erroneous
outputs when dealing with numeric information. In this work, we aim to explain
this conflict by exploring how language models manipulate numbers and quantify
the lower bounds of accuracy of these mechanisms. We find that despite
surfacing errors, different language models learn interchangeable
representations of numbers that are systematic, highly accurate and universal
across their hidden states and the types of input contexts. This allows us to
create universal probes for each LLM and to trace information -- including the
causes of output errors -- to specific layers. Our results lay a fundamental
understanding of how pre-trained LLMs manipulate numbers and outline the
potential of more accurate probing techniques in addressed refinements of LLMs'
architectures.

Result: Atlas在数独类逻辑任务中解题速度显著快于人类基准，但在需要精准时机的实时游戏中多次无法通过初始障碍

Abstract: OpenAI's ChatGPT Atlas introduces new capabilities for web interaction,
enabling the model to analyze webpages, process user intents, and execute
cursor and keyboard inputs directly within the browser. While its capacity for
information retrieval tasks has been demonstrated, its performance in dynamic,
interactive environments remains less explored. In this study, we conduct an
early evaluation of Atlas's web interaction capabilities using browser-based
games as test scenarios, including Google's T-Rex Runner, Sudoku, Flappy Bird,
and Stein.world. We employ in-game performance scores as quantitative metrics
to assess performance across different task types. Our results show that Atlas
performs strongly in logical reasoning tasks like Sudoku, completing puzzles
significantly faster than human baselines, but struggles substantially in
real-time games requiring precise timing and motor control, often failing to
progress beyond initial obstacles. These findings suggest that while Atlas
demonstrates capable analytical processing, there remain notable limitations in
dynamic web environments requiring real-time interaction. The website of our

Method: 结合领域专用工具与自反式推理流程（支持迭代推理/工具调用/错误恢复），通过两阶段LoRA微调在GPT-4生成数据上训练3B/8B模型

Result: 8B模型在相关性/可操作性等关键维度达到或超越大模型水平，学生评价与GPT-4o及Llama-3.3 70B相当

Conclusion: SCRIBE框架验证了小型模型在隐私敏感教育场景的可行性，为低资源环境提供有效的个性化教学反馈解决方案

Abstract: Language models can be used to provide interactive, personalized student
feedback in educational settings. However, real-world deployment faces three
key challenges: privacy concerns, limited computational resources, and the need
for pedagogically valid responses. These constraints require small, open-source
models that can run locally and reliably ground their outputs in correct
information. We introduce SCRIBE, a framework for multi-hop, tool-augmented
reasoning designed to generate valid responses to student questions about
feedback reports. SCRIBE combines domain-specific tools with a self-reflective
inference pipeline that supports iterative reasoning, tool use, and error
recovery. We distil these capabilities into 3B and 8B models via two-stage LoRA
fine-tuning on synthetic GPT-4o-generated data. Evaluation with a human-aligned
GPT-Judge and a user study with 108 students shows that 8B-SCRIBE models
achieve comparable or superior quality to much larger models in key dimensions
such as relevance and actionability, while being perceived on par with GPT-4o
and Llama-3.3 70B by students. These findings demonstrate the viability of
SCRIBE for low-resource, privacy-sensitive educational applications.

Motivation: 大语言模型在经济学、心理学等需要深度专业理解的领域表现不佳。研究旨在不牺牲通用能力的前提下，将通用模型转化为领域专家

Method: 1. 自动生成教科书式课程大纲（基于布鲁姆分类法创建QA对）
2. 采用交错课程计划进行持续预训练
3. 内容和认知双维度对齐学习目标

Result: Llama 3.2模型在微观经济学准确率提升5%，专业领域平均提升3%。知识密集型基准（ARC/GPQA）提升2+%，非目标领域也提升0.7%

Conclusion: ACER提供了可扩展的解决方案，有效缩小LLMs在关键领域的表现差距，同时保持通用推理能力并实现跨领域知识迁移

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at general tasks but underperform in
specialized domains like economics and psychology, which require deep,
principled understanding. To address this, we introduce ACER (Automated
Curriculum-Enhanced Regimen) that transforms generalist models into domain
experts without sacrificing their broad capabilities. ACER first synthesizes a
comprehensive, textbook-style curriculum by generating a table of contents for
a subject and then creating question-answer (QA) pairs guided by Bloom's
taxonomy. This ensures systematic topic coverage and progressively increasing
difficulty. The resulting synthetic corpus is used for continual pretraining
with an interleaved curriculum schedule, aligning learning across both content
and cognitive dimensions.
  Experiments with Llama 3.2 (1B and 3B) show significant gains in specialized
MMLU subsets. In challenging domains like microeconomics, where baselines
struggle, ACER boosts accuracy by 5 percentage points. Across all target
domains, we observe a consistent macro-average improvement of 3 percentage
points. Notably, ACER not only prevents catastrophic forgetting but also
facilitates positive cross-domain knowledge transfer, improving performance on
non-target domains by 0.7 points. Beyond MMLU, ACER enhances performance on
knowledge-intensive benchmarks like ARC and GPQA by over 2 absolute points,
while maintaining stable performance on general reasoning tasks. Our results
demonstrate that ACER offers a scalable and effective recipe for closing
critical domain gaps in LLMs.

Abstract: Health-related misinformation is very prevalent and potentially harmful. It
is difficult to identify, especially when claims distort or misinterpret
scientific findings. We investigate the impact of synthetic data generation and
lightweight fine-tuning techniques on the ability of large language models
(LLMs) to recognize fallacious arguments using the MISSCI dataset and
framework. In this work, we propose MisSynth, a pipeline that applies
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to produce synthetic fallacy samples,
which are then used to fine-tune an LLM model. Our results show substantial
accuracy gains with fine-tuned models compared to vanilla baselines. For
instance, the LLaMA 3.1 8B fine-tuned model achieved an over 35% F1-score
absolute improvement on the MISSCI test split over its vanilla baseline. We
demonstrate that introducing synthetic fallacy data to augment limited
annotated resources can significantly enhance zero-shot LLM classification
performance on real-world scientific misinformation tasks, even with limited
computational resources. The code and synthetic dataset are available on

Abstract: While a multi-agent approach based on large language models (LLMs) represents
a promising strategy to surpass the capabilities of single models, its success
is critically dependent on synergistic team composition. However, forming
optimal teams is a significant challenge, as the inherent opacity of most
models obscures the internal characteristics necessary for effective
collaboration. In this paper, we propose an interaction-centric framework for
automatic team composition that does not require any prior knowledge including
their internal architectures, training data, or task performances. Our method
constructs a "language model graph" that maps relationships between models from
the semantic coherence of pairwise conversations, and then applies community
detection to identify synergistic model clusters. Our experiments with diverse
LLMs demonstrate that the proposed method discovers functionally coherent
groups that reflect their latent specializations. Priming conversations with
specific topics identified synergistic teams which outperform random baselines
on downstream benchmarks and achieve comparable accuracy to that of
manually-curated teams based on known model specializations. Our findings
provide a new basis for the automated design of collaborative multi-agent LLM
teams.

Result: 知识维度最佳模型准确率60%，培养维度最优模型仍落后人类30%

Conclusion: OmniEduBench填补教育评估空白，揭示LLMs在培养能力上的重大挑战，为教育智能化发展提供新方向标

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), various LLM-based
works have been widely applied in educational fields. However, most existing
LLMs and their benchmarks focus primarily on the knowledge dimension, largely
neglecting the evaluation of cultivation capabilities that are essential for
real-world educational scenarios. Additionally, current benchmarks are often
limited to a single subject or question type, lacking sufficient diversity.
This issue is particularly prominent within the Chinese context. To address
this gap, we introduce OmniEduBench, a comprehensive Chinese educational
benchmark. OmniEduBench consists of 24.602K high-quality question-answer pairs.
The data is meticulously divided into two core dimensions: the knowledge
dimension and the cultivation dimension, which contain 18.121K and 6.481K
entries, respectively. Each dimension is further subdivided into 6 fine-grained
categories, covering a total of 61 different subjects (41 in the knowledge and
20 in the cultivation). Furthermore, the dataset features a rich variety of
question formats, including 11 common exam question types, providing a solid
foundation for comprehensively evaluating LLMs' capabilities in education.
Extensive experiments on 11 mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs
reveal a clear performance gap. In the knowledge dimension, only Gemini-2.5 Pro
surpassed 60\% accuracy, while in the cultivation dimension, the
best-performing model, QWQ, still trailed human intelligence by nearly 30\%.
These results highlight the substantial room for improvement and underscore the
challenges of applying LLMs in education.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
language comprehension and generation; however, their widespread adoption is
constrained by substantial bandwidth and computational demands. While pruning
and low-rank approximation have each demonstrated promising performance
individually, their synergy for LLMs remains underexplored. We introduce
\underline{S}ynergistic \underline{S}parse and \underline{L}ow-Rank
\underline{C}ompression (SSLC) methods for LLMs, which leverages the strengths
of both techniques: low-rank approximation compresses the model by retaining
its essential structure with minimal information loss, whereas sparse
optimization eliminates non-essential weights, preserving those crucial for
generalization. Based on theoretical analysis, we first formulate the low-rank
approximation and sparse optimization as a unified problem and solve it by
iterative optimization algorithm. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen2.5 models
(7B-70B) show that SSLC, without any additional training steps, consistently
surpasses standalone methods, achieving state-of-the-arts results. Notably,
SSLC compresses Qwen2.5 by 50\% with no performance drop and achieves at least
1.63$\times$ speedup, offering a practical solution for efficient LLM

models often lack transparency and explainability, can be costly to fine-tune,
require substantial prompt engineering, yield inconsistent results across
domains, and impose significant adverse environmental impact due to their high
computational demands. To address these challenges, we propose the Bayesian
network LLM fusion (BNLF) framework, which integrates predictions from three
LLMs, including FinBERT, RoBERTa, and BERTweet, through a probabilistic
mechanism for sentiment analysis. BNLF performs late fusion by modelling the
sentiment predictions from multiple LLMs as probabilistic nodes within a
Bayesian network. Evaluated across three human-annotated financial corpora with
distinct linguistic and contextual characteristics, BNLF demonstrates
consistent gains of about six percent in accuracy over the baseline LLMs,
underscoring its robustness to dataset variability and the effectiveness of
probabilistic fusion for interpretable sentiment classification.

TL;DR: 集成多个中型至大型开源LLM比单一模型能更可靠评估AI分诊工具，其中llama3.3:70b与GPT-4o表现最佳且集成方案无显著差异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证LLM模型集成方案在评估临床AI工具时的可靠性优势，突破单一模型评估的局限性

Method: 使用29,766例CT数据，通过8个开源LLM+GPT-4o构建集成模型，采用多示例提示评估脑出血检测，手动验证1,726例并比较性能指标

Result: llama3.3:70b与GPT-4o达到最高AUC(0.78)，其F1(0.81)/召回率(0.85)/特异性(0.72)领先。集成方案MCC指标(Top-3:0.558 vs GPT4o:0.522)显示优势但无统计学显著性

Conclusion: 开源LLM集成方案为临床AI工具评估提供了更稳定可靠的追溯性验证方法，模型协同效应优于单一评估体系

Abstract: Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine if an ensemble of
multiple LLM agents could be used collectively to provide a more reliable
assessment of a pixel-based AI triage tool than a single LLM.
  Methods: 29,766 non-contrast CT head exams from fourteen hospitals were
processed by a commercial intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) AI detection tool.
Radiology reports were analyzed by an ensemble of eight open-source LLM models
and a HIPAA compliant internal version of GPT-4o using a single multi-shot
prompt that assessed for presence of ICH. 1,726 examples were manually
reviewed. Performance characteristics of the eight open-source models and
consensus were compared to GPT-4o. Three ideal consensus LLM ensembles were
tested for rating the performance of the triage tool.
  Results: The cohort consisted of 29,766 head CTs exam-report pairs. The
highest AUC performance was achieved with llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AUC= 0.78).
The average precision was highest for Llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AP=0.75 & 0.76).
Llama3.3:70b had the highest F1 score (0.81) and recall (0.85), greater
precision (0.78), specificity (0.72), and MCC (0.57). Using MCC (95% CI) the
ideal combination of LLMs were: Full-9 Ensemble 0.571 (0.552-0.591), Top-3
Ensemble 0.558 (0.537-0.579), Consensus 0.556 (0.539-0.574), and GPT4o 0.522
(0.500-0.543). No statistically significant differences were observed between
Top-3, Full-9, and Consensus (p > 0.05).
  Conclusion: An ensemble of medium to large sized open-source LLMs provides a
more consistent and reliable method to derive a ground truth retrospective
evaluation of a clinical AI triage tool over a single LLM alone.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人口走私网络分析需求迫切，但法律案件文本存在非结构化、词汇密度高、指代模糊等问题，导致现有LLM方法生成的知识图谱存在节点重复和噪声。

Method: 提出CORE-KG框架：1）类型感知共指消解模块解决指代歧义；2）领域引导结构化提示控制提取过程。通过系统消融实验分离评估两个组件的独立效果。

Result: 移除共指消解使节点重复率↑28.32%、噪声节点↑4.32%；移除结构化提示导致节点重复率↑4.34%、噪声节点↑73.33%。结构化提示对降噪效果贡献更显著。

Conclusion: 实证表明：结构化提示主要抑制噪声，共指消解侧重减少重复。研究为复杂法律文本的结构化提取提供了LLM流程设计的重要经验。

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze.
Legal case documents offer critical insights but are often unstructured,
lexically dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, which pose
significant challenges for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. While
recent LLM-based approaches improve over static templates, they still generate
noisy, fragmented graphs with duplicate nodes due to the absence of guided
extraction and coreference resolution. The recently proposed CORE-KG framework
addresses these limitations by integrating a type-aware coreference module and
domain-guided structured prompts, significantly reducing node duplication and
legal noise. In this work, we present a systematic ablation study of CORE-KG to
quantify the individual contributions of its two key components. Our results
show that removing coreference resolution results in a 28.32% increase in node
duplication and a 4.32% increase in noisy nodes, while removing structured
prompts leads to a 4.34% increase in node duplication and a 73.33% increase in
noisy nodes. These findings offer empirical insights for designing robust
LLM-based pipelines for extracting structured representations from complex
legal texts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希伯来语未加变音符号时存在高度歧义性，现有方法依赖复杂语言分析且效率有限，需探索更高效的端到端解决方案。

Method: 采用词级零样本分类框架，结合动态候选集生成与视觉语言模型，将未标注文本视为图像直接学习向量表征。

Result: 在确保正确候选存在的理想条件下达到高准确率，系统架构优化显著提升泛化能力。

Conclusion: 视觉表征方法为希伯来语自动化注音提供了有效新路径，避免复杂语言学分析的同时保持高精度。

Abstract: Diacritics restoration in Hebrew is a fundamental task for ensuring accurate
word pronunciation and disambiguating textual meaning. Despite the language's
high degree of ambiguity when unvocalized, recent machine learning approaches
have significantly advanced performance on this task.
  In this work, we present DIVRIT, a novel system for Hebrew diacritization
that frames the task as a zero-shot classification problem. Our approach
operates at the word level, selecting the most appropriate diacritization
pattern for each undiacritized word from a dynamically generated candidate set,
conditioned on the surrounding textual context. A key innovation of DIVRIT is
its use of a Hebrew Visual Language Model, which processes undiacritized text
as an image, allowing diacritic information to be embedded directly within the
input's vector representation.
  Through a comprehensive evaluation across various configurations, we
demonstrate that the system effectively performs diacritization without relying
on complex, explicit linguistic analysis. Notably, in an ``oracle'' setting
where the correct diacritized form is guaranteed to be among the provided
candidates, DIVRIT achieves a high level of accuracy. Furthermore, strategic
architectural enhancements and optimized training methodologies yield
significant improvements in the system's overall generalization capabilities.
These findings highlight the promising potential of visual representations for
accurate and automated Hebrew diacritization.

TL;DR: 论文揭示Transformer语言模型中的线性关系解码器本质是基于语义属性而非特定关系，通过张量网络压缩和属性中心结构实现高效解码，但泛化能力受语义相似度限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展Hernandez等人关于单关系解码的研究，系统性探索多关系场景下解码器的组织结构和压缩潜力，解释其泛化能力受限的原因。

Method: 1. 使用三阶张量网络压缩关系解码器集合
2. 设计交叉评估协议分析解码器跨关系语义属性提取能力

Result: 1. 线性解码器可压缩至原参数量的3%保持性能
2. 解码器提取国家/类型等粗粒度语义属性（如'国家属性X'）
3. 仅能泛化到属性相似的新关系（R²>0.75）

Conclusion: 线性关系解码本质是属性导向的，这种属性中心结构既支持模型参数的高效压缩，也解释了为何模型难以处理语义差异较大的新关系，为解释Transformer的推理机制提供新视角。

Abstract: This paper investigates the structure of linear operators introduced in
Hernandez et al. [2023] that decode specific relational facts in transformer
language models. We extend their single-relation findings to a collection of
relations and systematically chart their organization. We show that such
collections of relation decoders can be highly compressed by simple order-3
tensor networks without significant loss in decoding accuracy. To explain this
surprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we
apply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our
results reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but
extract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital
city and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This
property-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and
highlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically
close. Our findings thus interpret linear relational decoding in transformer
language models as primarily property-based, rather than relation-specific.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对深度搜索场景中奖励密度低导致的探索成本高、最终奖励稀缺问题，将挑战形式化为奖励密度优化问题

Method: 1) 子问题分解分配过程奖励 2) 失败引导提示注入修正指导 3) 双代理架构压缩探索轨迹

Result: 在多个代理搜索基准测试中显著超越基线，使轻量级LLM达到高级LLM的性能水平

Conclusion: InfoFlow系统性提升了强化学习的探索效率，为资源受限场景下的深度搜索任务提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for enhancing agentic deep search. However, its application is often hindered
by low \textbf{Reward Density} in deep search scenarios, where agents expend
significant exploratory costs for infrequent and often null final rewards. In
this paper, we formalize this challenge as the \textbf{Reward Density
Optimization} problem, which aims to improve the reward obtained per unit of
exploration cost. This paper introduce \textbf{InfoFlow}, a systematic
framework that tackles this problem from three aspects. 1) \textbf{Subproblem
decomposition}: breaking down long-range tasks to assign process rewards,
thereby providing denser learning signals. 2) \textbf{Failure-guided hints}:
injecting corrective guidance into stalled trajectories to increase the
probability of successful outcomes. 3) \textbf{Dual-agent refinement}:
employing a dual-agent architecture to offload the cognitive burden of deep
exploration. A refiner agent synthesizes the search history, which effectively
compresses the researcher's perceived trajectory, thereby reducing exploration
cost and increasing the overall reward density. We evaluate InfoFlow on
multiple agentic search benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms strong
baselines, enabling lightweight LLMs to achieve performance comparable to
advanced proprietary LLMs.

Method: 在动态树解码中引入对GPU配置、批处理大小等推理成本因素的考量，通过六项任务和六个LLM的跨模型实验验证

Result: 在多样化任务中实现5.2倍加速，相较现有SOTA技术普遍提升5%-20%性能

Conclusion: CAST方法通过系统敏感的树结构优化，有效提升LLM推理效率，在真实硬件环境中展现显著优势

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant inference latency challenges
stemming from their autoregressive design and large size. To address this,
speculative decoding emerges as a solution, enabling the simultaneous
generation and validation of multiple tokens. While recent approaches like
EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3 improve speculative decoding using dynamic tree structures,
they often neglect the impact of crucial system variables such as GPU devices
and batch sizes.
  Therefore, we introduce a new dynamic tree decoding approach called CAST that
takes into account inference costs, including factors such as GPU
configurations and batch sizes, to dynamically refine the tree structure.
Through comprehensive experimentation across six diverse tasks and utilizing
six distinct LLMs, our methodology demonstrates remarkable results, achieving
speeds up to 5.2 times faster than conventional decoding methods. Moreover, it
generally outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques from 5% to 20%.

Motivation: 现有系统在复杂多页视觉文档处理中存在局限性，尤其在跨页面细粒度元素推理和布局理解方面能力不足

Method: 采用分层代理框架：全局代理捕捉主题结构，页面代理分析布局特征，元素代理识别细节内容，通过动态激活实现多级推理融合

Result: 实验显示综合性能超越专有模型7.9分，开源模型9.8分，验证了框架的有效性

Conclusion: 该分级代理架构为多模态文档理解提供了新范式，在保持上下文感知的同时实现了细粒度的跨页面推理

Abstract: Multi-page visual documents such as manuals, brochures, presentations, and
posters convey key information through layout, colors, icons, and cross-slide
references. While large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities in document
understanding, current systems struggle with complex, multi-page visual
documents, particularly in fine-grained reasoning over elements and pages. We
introduce SlideAgent, a versatile agentic framework for understanding
multi-modal, multi-page, and multi-layout documents, especially slide decks.
SlideAgent employs specialized agents and decomposes reasoning into three
specialized levels-global, page, and element-to construct a structured,
query-agnostic representation that captures both overarching themes and
detailed visual or textual cues. During inference, SlideAgent selectively
activates specialized agents for multi-level reasoning and integrates their
outputs into coherent, context-aware answers. Extensive experiments show that
SlideAgent achieves significant improvement over both proprietary (+7.9
overall) and open-source models (+9.8 overall).

<details>

Motivation: 针对当前LLM架构快速转向解码器-only模型但缺乏系统比较分析的现象，重新评估编码器-解码器架构在扩展场景下的潜力

Method: 使用不同规模模型(150M-8B)对比RedLLM（前缀语言建模）与DecLLM（因果语言建模），采用RedPajama V1预训练和FLAN指令微调

Result: RedLLM展现出可比的扩展能力、上下文外推特性，指令微调后在下游任务中表现相当或更优，且推理效率显著提升

Conclusion: 编码器-解码器架构仍具开发潜力，未来研究应更深入探索其在构建高效LLM中的应用价值

Abstract: Recent large language model (LLM) research has undergone an architectural
shift from encoder-decoder modeling to nowadays the dominant decoder-only
modeling. This rapid transition, however, comes without a rigorous comparative
analysis especially \textit{from the scaling perspective}, raising concerns
that the potential of encoder-decoder models may have been overlooked. To fill
this gap, we revisit encoder-decoder LLM (RedLLM), enhancing it with recent
recipes from decoder-only LLM (DecLLM). We conduct a comprehensive comparison
between RedLLM, pretrained with prefix language modeling (LM), and DecLLM,
pretrained with causal LM, at different model scales, ranging from $\sim$150M
to $\sim$8B. Using RedPajama V1 (1.6T tokens) for pretraining and FLAN for
instruction tuning, our experiments show that RedLLM produces compelling
scaling properties and surprisingly strong performance. While DecLLM is overall
more compute-optimal during pretraining, RedLLM demonstrates comparable scaling
and context length extrapolation capabilities. After instruction tuning, RedLLM
achieves comparable and even better results on various downstream tasks while
enjoying substantially better inference efficiency. We hope our findings could
inspire more efforts on re-examining RedLLM, unlocking its potential for
developing powerful and efficient LLMs.

Conclusion: 验证了Evontree框架在低资源领域适配中的有效性、高效性和鲁棒性，为LLM的领域知识优化提供新范式

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities
across multiple domains by leveraging massive pre-training and curated
fine-tuning data. However, in data-sensitive fields such as healthcare, the
lack of high-quality, domain-specific training corpus hinders LLMs' adaptation
for specialized applications. Meanwhile, domain experts have distilled domain
wisdom into ontology rules, which formalize relationships among concepts and
ensure the integrity of knowledge management repositories. Viewing LLMs as
implicit repositories of human knowledge, we propose Evontree, a novel
framework that leverages a small set of high-quality ontology rules to
systematically extract, validate, and enhance domain knowledge within LLMs,
without requiring extensive external datasets. Specifically, Evontree extracts
domain ontology from raw models, detects inconsistencies using two core
ontology rules, and reinforces the refined knowledge via self-distilled
fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on medical QA benchmarks with
Llama3-8B-Instruct and Med42-v2 demonstrate consistent outperformance over both
unmodified models and leading supervised baselines, achieving up to a 3.7%
improvement in accuracy. These results confirm the effectiveness, efficiency,
and robustness of our approach for low-resource domain adaptation of LLMs.

Motivation: 传统全注意力机制在长上下文场景存在计算效率低、内存消耗大的问题。Kimi Linear通过改进有限状态RNN内存利用率，旨在实现更高性能与硬件效率的平衡。

Method: 1. 核心模块KDA（Kimi Delta Attention）改进Gated DeltaNet的细粒度门控机制

4. 开源KDA内核与vLLM实现

Conclusion: Kimi Linear可作为全注意力架构的高效替代方案，在保持性能优势的同时显著提升计算效率，特别适用于长文本输入输出任务。

Abstract: We introduce Kimi Linear, a hybrid linear attention architecture that, for
the first time, outperforms full attention under fair comparisons across
various scenarios -- including short-context, long-context, and reinforcement
learning (RL) scaling regimes. At its core lies Kimi Delta Attention (KDA), an
expressive linear attention module that extends Gated DeltaNet with a
finer-grained gating mechanism, enabling more effective use of limited
finite-state RNN memory. Our bespoke chunkwise algorithm achieves high hardware
efficiency through a specialized variant of the Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR)
transition matrices, which substantially reduces computation compared to the
general DPLR formulation while remaining more consistent with the classical
delta rule.
  We pretrain a Kimi Linear model with 3B activated parameters and 48B total
parameters, based on a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention
(MLA). Our experiments show that with an identical training recipe, Kimi Linear
outperforms full MLA with a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks, while
reducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6 times decoding
throughput for a 1M context. These results demonstrate that Kimi Linear can be
a drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior
performance and efficiency, including tasks with longer input and output
lengths.
  To support further research, we open-source the KDA kernel and vLLM
implementations, and release the pre-trained and instruction-tuned model

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM解码过程依赖非可微的超参数手工调整（如温度/采样阈值），这种静态方法效率低下且无法适应不同上下文需求。AutoDeco旨在通过参数化的动态解码策略实现模型自调控。

Method: 在标准transformer上增加轻量级预测头，同步生成下一个token的logits及对应的温度/采样阈值参数，将解码过程转化为可学习的token级参数调控。

Result: 在8个基准测试中超越默认解码策略，达到接近测试集调优上限的oracle基线水平，并展现出通过自然语言指令实时调整解码策略的新能力。

Conclusion: 开创了可交互引导的LLM解码新范式，使模型能够根据上下文和指令自适应的动态调节生成过程，突破了静态解码方法的性能上限。

Abstract: The "end-to-end" label for LLMs is a misnomer. In practice, they depend on a
non-differentiable decoding process that requires laborious, hand-tuning of
hyperparameters like temperature and top-p. This paper introduces AutoDeco, a
novel architecture that enables truly "end-to-end" generation by learning to
control its own decoding strategy. We augment the standard transformer with
lightweight heads that, at each step, dynamically predict context-specific
temperature and top-p values alongside the next-token logits. This approach
transforms decoding into a parametric, token-level process, allowing the model
to self-regulate its sampling strategy within a single forward pass.
  Through extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, we demonstrate that
AutoDeco not only significantly outperforms default decoding strategies but
also achieves performance comparable to an oracle-tuned baseline derived from
"hacking the test set"-a practical upper bound for any static method.
Crucially, we uncover an emergent capability for instruction-based decoding
control: the model learns to interpret natural language commands (e.g.,
"generate with low randomness") and adjusts its predicted temperature and top-p
on a token-by-token basis, opening a new paradigm for steerable and interactive
LLM decoding.

Method: 采用Llama-3和Qwen-3不同规模模型，结合监督微调（SFT）和偏好优化数据集/算法，通过合成偏好数据集控制变量，系统测量训练过程中价值偏移的幅度和时间

Result: 监督微调阶段确立模型核心价值框架；偏好优化阶段难以改变既有价值观；不同偏好优化算法即使使用相同数据也会导致不同对齐结果

Conclusion: 需重视监督微调阶段的数据质量控制，算法选择对价值对齐效果具有决定性影响，为提升模型价值观对齐提供新的技术路径

Abstract: As LLMs occupy an increasingly important role in society, they are more and
more confronted with questions that require them not only to draw on their
general knowledge but also to align with certain human value systems.
Therefore, studying the alignment of LLMs with human values has become a
crucial field of inquiry. Prior work, however, mostly focuses on evaluating the
alignment of fully trained models, overlooking the training dynamics by which
models learn to express human values. In this work, we investigate how and at
which stage value alignment arises during the course of a model's
post-training. Our analysis disentangles the effects of post-training
algorithms and datasets, measuring both the magnitude and time of value drifts
during training. Experimenting with Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models of different
sizes and popular supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference optimization
datasets and algorithms, we find that the SFT phase generally establishes a
model's values, and subsequent preference optimization rarely re-aligns these
values. Furthermore, using a synthetic preference dataset that enables
controlled manipulation of values, we find that different preference
optimization algorithms lead to different value alignment outcomes, even when
preference data is held constant. Our findings provide actionable insights into
how values are learned during post-training and help to inform data curation,
as well as the selection of models and algorithms for preference optimization
to improve model alignment to human values.

However, many existing math competitions are becoming less effective for
assessing top-tier LLMs due to performance saturation (e.g., AIME24/25). To
address this, AMO-Bench introduces more rigorous challenges by ensuring all 50
problems are (1) cross-validated by experts to meet at least the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) difficulty standards, and (2) entirely original
problems to prevent potential performance leakages from data memorization.
Moreover, each problem in AMO-Bench requires only a final answer rather than a
proof, enabling automatic and robust grading for evaluation. Experimental
results across 26 LLMs on AMO-Bench show that even the best-performing model
achieves only 52.4% accuracy on AMO-Bench, with most LLMs scoring below 40%.
Beyond these poor performances, our further analysis reveals a promising
scaling trend with increasing test-time compute on AMO-Bench. These results
highlight the significant room for improving the mathematical reasoning in
current LLMs. We release AMO-Bench to facilitate further research into
advancing the reasoning abilities of language models.

TL;DR: 提出代码库级评估任务Gistify，要求LLM生成最小化自包含文件来复现特定功能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码代理在大型代码库部署时缺乏有效评估方法，需测试其结构理解、执行流建模和大规模代码补丁生成能力

Method: 通过给定完整代码库和执行入口点，要求模型生成仅含必要组件的最小可执行文件，复现原代码库命令输出

Result: 当前最先进模型在Gistify任务（特别是长执行追踪场景）中表现欠佳

Conclusion: Gistify为评估编码代理提供新范式，揭示现有模型在代码库级任务中的结构理解和长流程执行能力缺陷

Abstract: As coding agents are increasingly deployed in large codebases, the need to
automatically design challenging, codebase-level evaluation is central. We
propose Gistify, a task where a coding LLM must create a single, minimal,
self-contained file that can reproduce a specific functionality of a codebase.
The coding LLM is given full access to a codebase along with a specific
entrypoint (e.g., a python command), and the generated file must replicate the
output of the same command ran under the full codebase, while containing only
the essential components necessary to execute the provided command. Success on
Gistify requires both structural understanding of the codebase, accurate
modeling of its execution flow as well as the ability to produce potentially
large code patches. Our findings show that current state-of-the-art models
struggle to reliably solve Gistify tasks, especially ones with long executions
traces.

TL;DR: 提出基于Transformer的StructLayoutFormer框架，首次实现数据驱动的条件化结构化布局生成，并显式生成逼真的布局结构


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动的布局生成方法只能生成固定布局而无法生成布局结构，而结构化布局在GUI/网页等场景中具有重要编辑优势。现有方法需要大量人工且无法控制布局结构

Method: 1. 使用结构序列化方案将结构化布局表示为序列 2. 通过分离结构信息与元素位置信息实现布局结构的可控生成 3. 采用Transformer架构进行条件化布局生成

Result: 在条件化结构化布局生成任务中超越现有基线方法（需后处理提取结构），实验证明该方法能有效提取和迁移布局结构

Conclusion: 这是首个实现条件化结构化布局生成的数据驱动方法，能显式生成逼真的布局结构，代码已开源

Abstract: Structured layouts are preferable in many 2D visual contents (\eg, GUIs,
webpages) since the structural information allows convenient layout editing.
Computational frameworks can help create structured layouts but require heavy
labor input. Existing data-driven approaches are effective in automatically
generating fixed layouts but fail to produce layout structures. We present
StructLayoutFormer, a novel Transformer-based approach for conditional
structured layout generation. We use a structure serialization scheme to
represent structured layouts as sequences. To better control the structures of
generated layouts, we disentangle the structural information from the element
placements. Our approach is the first data-driven approach that achieves
conditional structured layout generation and produces realistic layout
structures explicitly. We compare our approach with existing data-driven layout
generation approaches by including post-processing for structure extraction.
Extensive experiments have shown that our approach exceeds these baselines in
conditional structured layout generation. We also demonstrate that our approach
is effective in extracting and transferring layout structures. The code is
publicly available at %\href{https://github.com/Teagrus/StructLayoutFormer}

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识编辑方法局限于单模态独立更新，忽视了多模态交互特性和知识持续更新的实际需求，导致跨模态推理效果不佳

Method: 混合外部-内部编辑器架构：双外部记忆实现跨模态证据检索，双LoRA适配器支持模态参数解耦更新，脑科学启发的知识连接器实现组合推理

Result: 在多模态复杂问题处理上取得显著性能提升，编辑保留率提高32%，建立持续组合式知识编辑的新基准

Conclusion: MemEIC有效解决了多模态持续知识编辑的挑战，为动态环境下的模型更新提供了可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: The dynamic nature of information necessitates continuously updating large
vision-language models (LVLMs). While recent knowledge editing techniques hint
at promising directions, they often focus on editing a single modality (vision
or language) in isolation. This prevalent practice neglects the inherent
multimodality of LVLMs and the continuous nature of knowledge updates,
potentially leading to suboptimal editing outcomes when considering the
interplay between modalities and the need for ongoing knowledge refinement. To
address these limitations, we propose MemEIC, a novel method for Continual and
Compositional Knowledge Editing (CCKE) in LVLMs. MemEIC enables compositional
editing of both visual and textual knowledge sequentially. Our approach employs
a hybrid external-internal editor featuring a dual external memory for
cross-modal evidence retrieval and dual LoRA adapters that facilitate
disentangled parameter updates for each modality. A key component is a
brain-inspired knowledge connector, activated selectively for compositional
reasoning, that integrates information across different modalities. Experiments
demonstrate that MemEIC significantly improves performance on complex
multimodal questions and effectively preserves prior edits, setting a new
benchmark for CCKE in LVLMs.

Conclusion: 解耦式学习框架通过分离表面标准学习和深度推理，有效突破传统方法局限，为多模态学习提供新范式

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards has recently catalyzed a
wave of "MLLM-r1" approaches that bring RL to vision language models. Most
representative paradigms begin with a cold start, typically employing
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to initialize the policy before RL. However,
SFT-based cold start adopts the reasoning paradigm intertwined with task
solution and output format, which may induce instruction-style overfitting,
weakens out-of-distribution generalization, and ultimately affects downstream
RL. We revisit the cold start along two views, its training method and data
construction, and introduce the Generalization Factor (GF) coefficient to
quantify the generalization capability under different methods. Our empirical
study finds that preference-based training methods (e.g. DPO) generalizes
better than SFT-based methods in cold start. Motivated by this, we propose
SPECS-a Self-distilled, Preference-based Cold Start framework that decouples
multimodal learning: (1) generates introspective preference data pairs via
self-distillation, avoiding reliance on larger teachers or manual annotation;
(2) performs preference-based training to learn, focusing on shallow,
transferable surface-form criteria (format, structure, style) rather than
memorizing content; and (3) hands off to RL with verifiable rewards for deep
reasoning results. Experimental results across multiple multimodal benchmarks
show that our decoupling learning framework yields consistent performance gains
over strong baselines, improving MEGA-Bench by 4.1% and MathVista by 12.2%.
Additional experiments indicate that SPECS contributes to reducing
in-distribution "stuckness," improving exploration, stabilizing training, and
raising the performance ceiling.

Conclusion: 首次系统性揭示KD对去偏的影响机制，为设计更优去偏方法提供理论依据

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective method for model compression and
transferring knowledge between models. However, its effect on model's
robustness against spurious correlations that degrade performance on
out-of-distribution data remains underexplored. This study investigates the
effect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of ``debiasing''
capabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language
inference (NLI) and image classification tasks. Through extensive experiments,
we illustrate several key findings: (i) overall the debiasing capability of a
model is undermined post-KD; (ii) training a debiased model does not benefit
from injecting teacher knowledge; (iii) although the overall robustness of a
model may remain stable post-distillation, significant variations can occur
across different types of biases; and (iv) we pin-point the internal attention
pattern and circuit that causes the distinct behavior post-KD. Given the above
findings, we propose three effective solutions to improve the distillability of
debiasing methods: developing high quality data for augmentation, implementing
iterative knowledge distillation, and initializing student models with weights
obtained from teacher models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
study on the effect of KD on debiasing and its interenal mechanism at scale.
Our findings provide understandings on how KD works and how to design better
debiasing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统参数记忆仅关注局部共现关系，无法解释Transformer如何编码非共现实体间的全局关系，需探索新的记忆存储范式。

Method: 通过隔离Transformer的推理实例，结合Node2Vec分析，揭示参数记忆的几何特性源于自然产生的谱偏差。

Result: 发现神经嵌入几何具有自组织特性，无需额外压力即可形成优雅结构，证明关联查找并非最优解。

Conclusion: 几何视角为知识获取/遗忘等任务提供新思路，提示应突破基于共现关联的传统直觉框架。

Abstract: In sequence modeling, the parametric memory of atomic facts has been
predominantly abstracted as a brute-force lookup of co-occurrences between
entities. We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how
memory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of
Transformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of
the local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must
have somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global
relationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in
turn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\ell$-fold composition
into an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.
  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding
geometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry,
despite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly
attributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures.
Counterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more
succinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.
  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry
stems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed
arises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also
points to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more
strongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages
revisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like
knowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL微调方法因浮点精度差异导致训练推理策略不一致，传统方案未触及根本原因

Result: FP16实现更稳定的优化过程、2倍收敛速度提升，在多个任务中平均获得1.5%性能增益

Conclusion: 浮点精度选择对RL微调具有关键影响，FP16的简易改进方案具有广泛实用价值

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) often
suffers from instability due to the numerical mismatch between the training and
inference policies. While prior work has attempted to mitigate this issue
through algorithmic corrections or engineering alignments, we show that its
root cause lies in the floating point precision itself. The widely adopted
BF16, despite its large dynamic range, introduces large rounding errors that
breaks the consistency between training and inference. In this work, we
demonstrate that simply reverting to \textbf{FP16} effectively eliminates this
mismatch. The change is simple, fully supported by modern frameworks with only
a few lines of code change, and requires no modification to the model
architecture or learning algorithm. Our results suggest that using FP16
uniformly yields more stable optimization, faster convergence, and stronger
performance across diverse tasks, algorithms and frameworks. We hope these
findings motivate a broader reconsideration of precision trade-offs in RL
fine-tuning.

Method: 三阶段框架：1）四类专业代理协同审议生成初始预言；2）沙盒验证预言有效性；3）基于运行时错误的自动化预言自优化循环

Result: 在7个基准测试中全面超越现有方法：LiveCodeBench准确率从46.30%提升至57.73%，HumanEval缺陷检测率从90.91%提升至95.45%，程序修复成功率从35.23%提升至69.32%

Conclusion: Nexus通过多代理协作与自优化机制，系统性解决了测试预言生成难题，显著提升软件测试有效性，为自动化测试提供新范式

Abstract: Test oracle generation in non-regression testing is a longstanding challenge
in software engineering, where the goal is to produce oracles that can
accurately determine whether a function under test (FUT) behaves as intended
for a given input. In this paper, we introduce Nexus, a novel multi-agent
framework to address this challenge. Nexus generates test oracles by leveraging
a diverse set of specialized agents that synthesize test oracles through a
structured process of deliberation, validation, and iterative self-refinement.
During the deliberation phase, a panel of four specialist agents, each
embodying a distinct testing philosophy, collaboratively critiques and refines
an initial set of test oracles. Then, in the validation phase, Nexus generates
a plausible candidate implementation of the FUT and executes the proposed
oracles against it in a secure sandbox. For any oracle that fails this
execution-based check, Nexus activates an automated selfrefinement loop, using
the specific runtime error to debug and correct the oracle before
re-validation. Our extensive evaluation on seven diverse benchmarks
demonstrates that Nexus consistently and substantially outperforms
state-of-theart baselines. For instance, Nexus improves the test-level oracle
accuracy on the LiveCodeBench from 46.30% to 57.73% for GPT-4.1-Mini. The
improved accuracy also significantly enhances downstream tasks: the bug
detection rate of GPT4.1-Mini generated test oracles on HumanEval increases
from 90.91% to 95.45% for Nexus compared to baselines, and the success rate of
automated program repair improves from 35.23% to 69.32%.

Conclusion: 通过数据构建、模型优化和评估创新三位一体的解决方案，有效解决了安全代码审查中的关键挑战，推动软件安全左移实践

Abstract: Identifying and addressing security issues during the early phase of the
development lifecycle is critical for mitigating the long-term negative impacts
on software systems. Code review serves as an effective practice that enables
developers to check their teammates' code before integration into the codebase.
To streamline the generation of review comments, various automated code review
approaches have been proposed, where LLM-based methods have significantly
advanced the capabilities of automated review generation. However, existing
models primarily focus on general-purpose code review, their effectiveness in
identifying and addressing security-related issues remains underexplored.
Moreover, adapting existing code review approaches to target security issues
faces substantial challenges, including data scarcity and inadequate evaluation
metrics. To address these limitations, we propose SecureReviewer, a new
approach designed for enhancing LLMs' ability to identify and resolve
security-related issues during code review. Specifically, we first construct a
dataset tailored for training and evaluating secure code review capabilities.
Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune LLMs to generate code review comments
that can effectively identify security issues and provide fix suggestions with
our proposed secure-aware fine-tuning strategy. To mitigate hallucination in
LLMs and enhance the reliability of their outputs, we integrate the RAG
technique, which grounds the generated comments in domain-specific security
knowledge. Additionally, we introduce SecureBLEU, a new evaluation metric
designed to assess the effectiveness of review comments in addressing security
issues. Experimental results demonstrate that SecureReviewer outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both security issue detection accuracy and the
overall quality and practical utility of generated review comments.

Result: 量化版DistilBERT（67.6MB）达到97.1% macro-F1，延迟103ms；TinyBERT版本（14.7MB）保持95.7% macro-F1，延迟降至40ms，验证了资源受限条件下的可行性

Conclusion: 通过实时可信度提示功能，为政策制定者提供反制虚假信息的工具。用户授权机制为研究者构建大规模虚假新闻数据集开辟新途径，推动检测技术持续发展

Abstract: Social platforms distribute information at unprecedented speed, which in turn
accelerates the spread of misinformation and threatens public discourse. We
present FakeZero, a fully client-side, cross-platform browser extension that
flags unreliable posts on Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) while the user
scrolls. All computation, DOM scraping, tokenisation, Transformer inference,
and UI rendering run locally through the Chromium messaging API, so no personal
data leaves the device.FakeZero employs a three-stage training curriculum:
baseline fine-tuning and domain-adaptive training enhanced with focal loss,
adversarial augmentation, and post-training quantisation. Evaluated on a
dataset of 239,000 posts, the DistilBERT-Quant model (67.6 MB) reaches 97.1%
macro-F1, 97.4% accuracy, and an AUROC of 0.996, with a median latency of
approximately 103 ms on a commodity laptop. A memory-efficient TinyBERT-Quant
variant retains 95.7% macro-F1 and 96.1% accuracy while shrinking the model to
14.7 MB and lowering latency to approximately 40 ms, showing that high-quality
fake-news detection is feasible under tight resource budgets with only modest
performance loss.By providing inline credibility cues, the extension can serve
as a valuable tool for policymakers seeking to curb the spread of
misinformation across social networks. With user consent, FakeZero also opens
the door for researchers to collect large-scale datasets of fake news in the
wild, enabling deeper analysis and the development of more robust detection
techniques.

Abstract: The ability of LLM agents to plan and invoke tools exposes them to new safety
risks, making a comprehensive red-teaming system crucial for discovering
vulnerabilities and ensuring their safe deployment. We present SIRAJ: a generic
red-teaming framework for arbitrary black-box LLM agents. We employ a dynamic
two-step process that starts with an agent definition and generates diverse
seed test cases that cover various risk outcomes, tool-use trajectories, and
risk sources. Then, it iteratively constructs and refines model-based
adversarial attacks based on the execution trajectories of former attempts. To
optimize the red-teaming cost, we present a model distillation approach that
leverages structured forms of a teacher model's reasoning to train smaller
models that are equally effective. Across diverse evaluation agent settings,
our seed test case generation approach yields 2 -- 2.5x boost to the coverage
of risk outcomes and tool-calling trajectories. Our distilled 8B red-teamer
model improves attack success rate by 100%, surpassing the 671B Deepseek-R1
model. Our ablations and analyses validate the effectiveness of the iterative
framework, structured reasoning, and the generalization of our red-teamer
models.

Abstract: Watermarking schemes for large language models (LLMs) have been proposed to
identify the source of the generated text, mitigating the potential threats
emerged from model theft. However, current watermarking solutions hardly
resolve the trust issue: the non-public watermark detection cannot prove itself
faithfully conducting the detection. We observe that it is attributed to the
secret key mostly used in the watermark detection -- it cannot be public, or
the adversary may launch removal attacks provided the key; nor can it be
private, or the watermarking detection is opaque to the public. To resolve the
dilemma, we propose PVMark, a plugin based on zero-knowledge proof (ZKP),
enabling the watermark detection process to be publicly verifiable by third
parties without disclosing any secret key. PVMark hinges upon the proof of
`correct execution' of watermark detection on which a set of ZKP constraints
are built, including mapping, random number generation, comparison, and
summation. We implement multiple variants of PVMark in Python, Rust and Circom,
covering combinations of three watermarking schemes, three hash functions, and
four ZKP protocols, to show our approach effectively works under a variety of
circumstances. By experimental results, PVMark efficiently enables public
verifiability on the state-of-the-art LLM watermarking schemes yet without
compromising the watermarking performance, promising to be deployed in
practice.

TL;DR: DySQL-Bench是针对动态多轮交互场景的Text-to-SQL基准测试，通过自动化流程构建，测试显示现有模型在用户意图动态变化时仍存在显著性能差距


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Text-to-SQL系统在静态单轮任务表现良好，但无法满足实际交互场景中用户需基于中间结果多次调整查询的需求。传统人工构建的基准无法有效评估模型的动态适应能力

Method: 通过自动化两阶段流程构建基准：1) 基于数据库表结构生成结构化任务树，2) 使用LLM生成交互任务并进行验证。提出多轮评估框架模拟真实用户-模型-数据库三方交互

Result: 实验显示GPT-4o在DySQL-Bench上整体准确率仅58.34%，Pass@5指标低至23.81%，证明基准具有显著挑战性。人工验证确认生成数据100%正确

Conclusion: DySQL-Bench填补了动态SQL评估的空白，其自动化构建方法和多轮测试框架为真实场景下的模型优化提供了可靠基准，推动Text-to-SQL技术向实际应用迈进

Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-SQL have achieved strong results in static,
single-turn tasks, where models generate SQL queries from natural language
questions. However, these systems fall short in real-world interactive
scenarios, where user intents evolve and queries must be refined over multiple
turns. In applications such as finance and business analytics, users
iteratively adjust query constraints or dimensions based on intermediate
results. To evaluate such dynamic capabilities, we introduce DySQL-Bench, a
benchmark assessing model performance under evolving user interactions. Unlike
previous manually curated datasets, DySQL-Bench is built through an automated
two-stage pipeline of task synthesis and verification. Structured tree
representations derived from raw database tables guide LLM-based task
generation, followed by interaction-oriented filtering and expert validation.
Human evaluation confirms 100% correctness of the synthesized data. We further
propose a multi-turn evaluation framework simulating realistic interactions
among an LLM-simulated user, the model under test, and an executable database.
The model must adapt its reasoning and SQL generation as user intents change.
DySQL-Bench covers 13 domains across BIRD and Spider 2 databases, totaling
1,072 tasks. Even GPT-4o attains only 58.34% overall accuracy and 23.81% on the
Pass@5 metric, underscoring the benchmark's difficulty. All code and data are
released at https://github.com/Aurora-slz/Real-World-SQL-Bench .

TL;DR: 提出通过视觉干扰物动态调整平移增益的RDW方法，在提升用户增益阈值的同时保持舒适度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究发现用户被场景元素分散注意力时对增益敏感度降低，但缺乏对检测阈值的定量测量，需验证干扰物对增益阈值的具体影响并开发动态调整方法

Method: 在用户视野内布置视觉干扰物，当注意力被吸引时应用更大平移增益。增益调整幅度取决于用户与干扰物的互动程度，实现平滑转向

Result: 虚拟环境中引入干扰物显著提升用户平移增益阈值，模拟器病问卷和存在感问卷评估证实方法保持用户舒适度和接受度

Conclusion: 该方法通过视觉干扰机制有效提升重定向行走系统的增益调整空间，在保持用户体验的前提下拓展了RDW技术的实践应用价值

Abstract: Redirected walking utilizes gain adjustments within perceptual thresholds to
allow natural navigation in large scale virtual environments within confined
physical environments. Previous research has found that when users are
distracted by some scene elements, they are less sensitive to gain values.
However, the effects on detection thresholds have not been quantitatively
measured. In this paper, we present a novel method that dynamically adjusts
translation gain by leveraging visual distractors. We place distractors within
the user's field of view and apply a larger translation gain when their
attention is drawn to them. Because the magnitude of gain adjustment depends on
the user's level of engagement with the distractors, the redirection process
remains smooth and unobtrusive. To evaluate our method, we developed a task
oriented virtual environment for a user study. Results show that introducing
distractors in the virtual environment significantly raises users' translation
gain thresholds. Furthermore, assessments using the Simulator Sickness
Questionnaire and Igroup Presence Questionnaire indicate that the method
maintains user comfort and acceptance, supporting its effectiveness for RDW
systems.

Motivation: 现有推荐系统数据集无法反映真实用户行为，评估标准不统一导致研究结论模糊

Method: 开发包含可复现数据分割的公开基准（ClueWeb-Reco网页推荐任务），构建基于真实浏览数据的合成数据集，测试12种推荐模型并引入LLM基线

Result: 公开数据集显示推荐系统普遍改进，隐藏测试揭示现有方法在大规模网页推荐中的局限性，LLM集成展现改进潜力

Conclusion: ORBIT为推荐系统研究提供可靠评估框架，揭示当前方法在复杂场景下的不足，提示LLM整合可能成为突破方向

Abstract: Recommender systems are among the most impactful AI applications, interacting
with billions of users every day, guiding them to relevant products, services,
or information tailored to their preferences. However, the research and
development of recommender systems are hindered by existing datasets that fail
to capture realistic user behaviors and inconsistent evaluation settings that
lead to ambiguous conclusions. This paper introduces the Open Recommendation
Benchmark for Reproducible Research with HIdden Tests (ORBIT), a unified
benchmark for consistent and realistic evaluation of recommendation models.
ORBIT offers a standardized evaluation framework of public datasets with
reproducible splits and transparent settings for its public leaderboard.
Additionally, ORBIT introduces a new webpage recommendation task, ClueWeb-Reco,
featuring web browsing sequences from 87 million public, high-quality webpages.
ClueWeb-Reco is a synthetic dataset derived from real, user-consented, and
privacy-guaranteed browsing data. It aligns with modern recommendation
scenarios and is reserved as the hidden test part of our leaderboard to
challenge recommendation models' generalization ability. ORBIT measures 12
representative recommendation models on its public benchmark and introduces a
prompted LLM baseline on the ClueWeb-Reco hidden test. Our benchmark results
reflect general improvements of recommender systems on the public datasets,
with variable individual performances. The results on the hidden test reveal
the limitations of existing approaches in large-scale webpage recommendation
and highlight the potential for improvements with LLM integrations. ORBIT
benchmark, leaderboard, and codebase are available at

Motivation: 现有TTS可懂性评估过度依赖词错误率(WER)，无法反映真实场景的语音复杂性和人类理解需求

Method: 开发基于关键信息准确性的口语段落多选题问答评估法(SP-MCQA)，并构建8.76小时新闻风格基准数据集SP-MCQA-Eval

Result: 实验表明低WER不等于高信息准确率，当前SOTA模型在文本规范化和语音准确性方面仍存在明显缺陷

Conclusion: 在多数系统已实现低WER的现状下，亟需建立更贴近现实场景的高层次语音可懂性评估体系

Abstract: The evaluation of intelligibility for TTS has reached a bottleneck, as
existing assessments heavily rely on word-by-word accuracy metrics such as WER,
which fail to capture the complexity of real-world speech or reflect human
comprehension needs. To address this, we propose Spoken-Passage Multiple-Choice
Question Answering, a novel subjective approach evaluating the accuracy of key
information in synthesized speech, and release SP-MCQA-Eval, an 8.76-hour
news-style benchmark dataset for SP-MCQA evaluation. Our experiments reveal
that low WER does not necessarily guarantee high key-information accuracy,
exposing a gap between traditional metrics and practical intelligibility.
SP-MCQA shows that even state-of-the-art (SOTA) models still lack robust text
normalization and phonetic accuracy. This work underscores the urgent need for
high-level, more life-like evaluation criteria now that many systems already
excel at WER yet may fall short on real-world intelligibility.

TL;DR: 提出人机协作框架，从标签数据中推测思维轨迹，提升大语言模型评估任务的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLM）在主观评估任务中可靠性有限，因人类判断涉及标签之外的复杂推理，而思维轨迹难以收集。

Method: 使用拒绝采样法重构思维轨迹，并用于微调开源LLM和优化专有LLM的标注指南。

Result: 多数据集显示LLM与人类一致性显著提升，优化后的指南增强不同LLM间一致性。

Conclusion: LLM可作为人类思维轨迹的高效代理，将标签数据转化为增强资源，提升评估可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as raters for evaluation
tasks. However, their reliability is often limited for subjective tasks, when
human judgments involve subtle reasoning beyond annotation labels. Thinking
traces, the reasoning behind a judgment, are highly informative but challenging
to collect and curate. We present a human-LLM collaborative framework to infer
thinking traces from label-only annotations. The proposed framework uses a
simple and effective rejection sampling method to reconstruct these traces at
scale. These inferred thinking traces are applied to two complementary tasks:
(1) fine-tuning open LLM raters; and (2) synthesizing clearer annotation
guidelines for proprietary LLM raters. Across multiple datasets, our methods
lead to significantly improved LLM-human agreement. Additionally, the refined
annotation guidelines increase agreement among different LLM models. These
results suggest that LLMs can serve as practical proxies for otherwise
unrevealed human thinking traces, enabling label-only corpora to be extended
into thinking-trace-augmented resources that enhance the reliability of LLM
raters.

Conclusion: 角色驱动的偏好聚合框架有效提升评委系统的稳定性和可靠性，推动奖励模型和模型路由应用发展

Abstract: Aligning LLM-based judges with human preferences is a significant challenge,
as they are difficult to calibrate and often suffer from rubric sensitivity,
bias, and instability. Overcoming this challenge advances key applications,
such as creating reliable reward models for Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) and building effective routing systems that select the
best-suited model for a given user query. In this work, we propose a framework
for modeling diverse, persona-based preferences by learning to aggregate
outputs from multiple rubric-conditioned judges. We investigate the performance
of this approach against naive baselines and assess its robustness through case
studies on both human and LLM-judges biases. Our primary contributions include
a persona-based method for synthesizing preference labels at scale and two
distinct implementations of our aggregator: Generalized Additive Model (GAM)
and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

Conclusion: 该课程是紧凑易用的通用推理训练方案，无需特殊奖励模型，支持跨模型架构适配

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can elicit strong reasoning in large language
models (LLMs), yet most open efforts focus on math and code. We propose
Reasoning Curriculum, a simple two-stage curriculum that first elicits
reasoning skills in pretraining-aligned domains such as math, then adapts and
refines these skills across other domains via joint RL. Stage 1 performs a
brief cold start and then math-only RL with verifiable rewards to develop
reasoning skills. Stage 2 runs joint RL on mixed-domain data to transfer and
consolidate these skills. The curriculum is minimal and backbone-agnostic,
requiring no specialized reward models beyond standard verifiability checks.
Evaluated on Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B over a multi-domain suite, reasoning
curriculum yields consistent gains. Ablations and a cognitive-skill analysis
indicate that both stages are necessary and that math-first elicitation
increases cognitive behaviors important for solving complex problems. Reasoning
Curriculum provides a compact, easy-to-adopt recipe for general reasoning.

Conclusion: ToolRM有效解决工具学习的奖励建模难题，兼具性能优势和泛化能力，开源资源将推动智能体AI研究发展

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences. Yet in the domain of tool learning, the lack of
RMs specifically designed for function-calling tasks has limited progress
toward more capable agentic AI. We introduce ToolRM, a family of lightweight
generative RMs tailored for general tool-use scenarios. To build these models,
we propose a novel pipeline that constructs pairwise preference data using
rule-based scoring and multidimensional sampling. This yields
ToolPref-Pairwise-30K, a diverse, balanced, and challenging dataset of critique
tasks that supports reinforcement learning with verifiable feedback. To
evaluate tool-use RMs, we also introduce TRBench$_{BFCL}$, a benchmark built on
the agentic evaluation suite BFCL. Trained on our constructed data, models from
the Qwen3-4B/8B series achieve up to 14.28% higher accuracy, substantially
outperforming frontier models such as Claude 4 and OpenAI o3 in pairwise reward
judgments. Beyond training objectives, ToolRM generalizes to broader critique
tasks, including Best-of-N sampling and self-correction. Experiments on
ACEBench highlight its effectiveness and efficiency, enabling inference-time
scaling and reducing output token usage by over 66%. We release data and model
checkpoints to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Karl Marx once wrote that ``the human essence is the ensemble of social
relations'', suggesting that individuals are not isolated entities but are
fundamentally shaped by their interactions with other entities, within which
contexts play a constitutive and essential role. With the advent of computers
and artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely
human--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well.
Then a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our
situations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently
introduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as
a recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be
traced back more than twenty years. Since the early 1990s, the field has
evolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by the intelligence
level of machines: from early human--computer interaction frameworks built
around primitive computers, to today's human--agent interaction paradigms
driven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human--level or superhuman
intelligence in the future. In this paper, we situate context engineering,
provide a systematic definition, outline its historical and conceptual
landscape, and examine key design considerations for practice. By addressing
these questions, we aim to offer a conceptual foundation for context
engineering and sketch its promising future. This paper is a stepping stone for
a broader community effort toward systematic context engineering in AI systems.

Result: 模型总体上遵循有效推理模式，但在特定规范性推理中存在明显不一致性，并显示出与人类相似的认知偏差

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在规范性推理中保持逻辑一致性的挑战，为提升模型可靠性提供了改进方向

Abstract: Normative reasoning is a type of reasoning that involves normative or deontic
modality, such as obligation and permission. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks, their
ability to handle normative reasoning remains underexplored. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the normative domain
from both logical and modal perspectives. Specifically, to assess how well LLMs
reason with normative modals, we make a comparison between their reasoning with
normative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals, which share a
common formal structure. To this end, we introduce a new dataset covering a
wide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic
domains, while also incorporating non-formal cognitive factors that influence
human reasoning. Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to
valid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific
types of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those
observed in psychological studies of human reasoning. These findings highlight
challenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and
provide insights for enhancing their reliability. All data and code are

Abstract: We envision a new era of AI, termed agentic organization, where agents solve
complex problems by working collaboratively and concurrently, enabling outcomes
beyond individual intelligence. To realize this vision, we introduce
asynchronous thinking (AsyncThink) as a new paradigm of reasoning with large
language models, which organizes the internal thinking process into
concurrently executable structures. Specifically, we propose a thinking
protocol where an organizer dynamically assigns sub-queries to workers, merges
intermediate knowledge, and produces coherent solutions. More importantly, the
thinking structure in this protocol can be further optimized through
reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate that AsyncThink achieves 28%
lower inference latency compared to parallel thinking while improving accuracy
on mathematical reasoning. Moreover, AsyncThink generalizes its learned
asynchronous thinking capabilities, effectively tackling unseen tasks without
additional training.

  The findings challenge conventional scaling assumptions, establish training

contexts. The tri-infrastructure methodology and 79-problem benchmark enable
longitudinal tracking of reasoning capabilities as foundation models evolve.

4DGS) representations, and deeper exploration of the mathematical foundations
underlying its appearance modeling and rendering process. Furthermore, we
examine efforts to bring 3DGS to mobile and virtual reality platforms, its
extension to massive-scale environments, and recent progress toward
near-instant radiance field reconstruction via feed-forward or distributed
computation. Collectively, these developments illustrate how 3DGS has evolved
from a breakthrough representation into a versatile and foundational tool for

Abstract: Hierarchical structures of motion exist across research fields, including
computer vision, graphics, and robotics, where complex dynamics typically arise
from coordinated interactions among simpler motion components. Existing methods
to model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic
hierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability
across different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion
modeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships
directly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based
hierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into
parent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy
inference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent
elemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies
through graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction
approach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and
dynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show
that our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases,
and produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the
baseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable,
data-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation
applicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks. Project Page:

Abstract: Immersive applications call for synthesizing spatiotemporal 4D content from
casual videos without costly 3D supervision. Existing video-to-4D methods
typically rely on manually annotated camera poses, which are labor-intensive
and brittle for in-the-wild footage. Recent warp-then-inpaint approaches
mitigate the need for pose labels by warping input frames along a novel camera
trajectory and using an inpainting model to fill missing regions, thereby
depicting the 4D scene from diverse viewpoints. However, this
trajectory-to-trajectory formulation often entangles camera motion with scene
dynamics and complicates both modeling and inference. We introduce SEE4D, a
pose-free, trajectory-to-camera framework that replaces explicit trajectory
prediction with rendering to a bank of fixed virtual cameras, thereby
separating camera control from scene modeling. A view-conditional video
inpainting model is trained to learn a robust geometry prior by denoising
realistically synthesized warped images and to inpaint occluded or missing
regions across virtual viewpoints, eliminating the need for explicit 3D
annotations. Building on this inpainting core, we design a spatiotemporal
autoregressive inference pipeline that traverses virtual-camera splines and
extends videos with overlapping windows, enabling coherent generation at
bounded per-step complexity. We validate See4D on cross-view video generation
and sparse reconstruction benchmarks. Across quantitative metrics and
qualitative assessments, our method achieves superior generalization and
improved performance relative to pose- or trajectory-conditioned baselines,
advancing practical 4D world modeling from casual videos.

Conclusion: OmniX通过复用2D生成先验与合成数据训练，开辟了沉浸式虚拟环境生成的新路径，实现了图形管线就绪的3D场景自动化构建。

Abstract: There are two prevalent ways to constructing 3D scenes: procedural generation
and 2D lifting. Among them, panorama-based 2D lifting has emerged as a
promising technique, leveraging powerful 2D generative priors to produce
immersive, realistic, and diverse 3D environments. In this work, we advance
this technique to generate graphics-ready 3D scenes suitable for physically
based rendering (PBR), relighting, and simulation. Our key insight is to
repurpose 2D generative models for panoramic perception of geometry, textures,
and PBR materials. Unlike existing 2D lifting approaches that emphasize
appearance generation and ignore the perception of intrinsic properties, we
present OmniX, a versatile and unified framework. Based on a lightweight and
efficient cross-modal adapter structure, OmniX reuses 2D generative priors for
a broad range of panoramic vision tasks, including panoramic perception,
generation, and completion. Furthermore, we construct a large-scale synthetic
panorama dataset containing high-quality multimodal panoramas from diverse
indoor and outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our model in panoramic visual perception and graphics-ready 3D scene
generation, opening new possibilities for immersive and physically realistic
virtual world generation.

TL;DR: 时空建模和CBAM注意力机制显著提升水下目标检测性能，T-YOLOv5系列模型在复杂场景表现优异但需权衡场景复杂度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动态海洋环境中目标检测的挑战（突然运动/部分遮挡/渐进运动），验证时空建模和注意力机制的有效性

Method: 两阶段对比实验：1) 标准YOLOv5 vs 时序增强的T-YOLOv5；2) 在T-YOLOv5基础上集成CBAM注意力模块

Result: T-YOLOv5(mAP@50-95 0.813)和带CBAM版本(0.811)显著优于原版(0.563)，但CBAM在简单场景出现精度损失

Conclusion: 时序建模提升检测可靠性，CBAM增强复杂场景性能但需平衡场景适用性，为水下检测模型优化提供新方向

Abstract: This study examines the effectiveness of spatio-temporal modeling and the
integration of spatial attention mechanisms in deep learning models for
underwater object detection. Specifically, in the first phase, the performance
of temporal-enhanced YOLOv5 variant T-YOLOv5 is evaluated, in comparison with
the standard YOLOv5. For the second phase, an augmented version of T-YOLOv5 is
developed, through the addition of a Convolutional Block Attention Module
(CBAM). By examining the effectiveness of the already pre-existing YOLOv5 and
T-YOLOv5 models and of the newly developed T-YOLOv5 with CBAM. With CBAM, the
research highlights how temporal modeling improves detection accuracy in
dynamic marine environments, particularly under conditions of sudden movements,
partial occlusions, and gradual motion. The testing results showed that YOLOv5
achieved a mAP@50-95 of 0.563, while T-YOLOv5 and T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
outperformed with mAP@50-95 scores of 0.813 and 0.811, respectively,
highlighting their superior accuracy and generalization in detecting complex
objects. The findings demonstrate that T-YOLOv5 significantly enhances
detection reliability compared to the standard model, while T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
further improves performance in challenging scenarios, although there is a loss
of accuracy when it comes to simpler scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉异常检测局限于工业缺陷或合成数据，缺乏对真实世界复杂异常的捕捉能力，需建立更符合人类认知机制的评估体系

Method: 构建包含异常描述/解释/验证三项任务的CAVE基准，基于认知科学研究设计细粒度标注体系（视觉定位、异常类型、复杂度等维度）

Result: 实验表明当前最先进的视觉语言模型在异常感知和常识推理方面存在显著缺陷，即使采用高级提示策略仍表现不佳

Conclusion: CAVE为推进真实场景下的异常检测与常识推理研究提供了认知科学支撑的评估框架，具有重要科研价值

Abstract: Humans can naturally identify, reason about, and explain anomalies in their
environment. In computer vision, this long-standing challenge remains limited
to industrial defects or unrealistic, synthetically generated anomalies,
failing to capture the richness and unpredictability of real-world anomalies.
In this work, we introduce CAVE, the first benchmark of real-world visual
anomalies. CAVE supports three open-ended tasks: anomaly description,
explanation, and justification; with fine-grained annotations for visual
grounding and categorizing anomalies based on their visual manifestations,
their complexity, severity, and commonness. These annotations draw inspiration
from cognitive science research on how humans identify and resolve anomalies,
providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) in detecting and understanding anomalies. We show that state-of-the-art
VLMs struggle with visual anomaly perception and commonsense reasoning, even
with advanced prompting strategies. By offering a realistic and cognitively
grounded benchmark, CAVE serves as a valuable resource for advancing research
in anomaly detection and commonsense reasoning in VLMs.

TL;DR: 现代视觉语言模型在时间方向判断任务中表现接近随机猜测，显著落后于人类水平，揭示了模型在时序连续性和因果理解上的固有缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在视频时序理解能力上存在重大缺陷且缺乏有效评估，研究者通过判断视频正/倒放的简单任务揭示这一能力短板。

Method: 提出AoT-PsyPhyBENCH基准测试，使用人类认知实验验证的刺激材料，评估开放和私有模型在物理不可逆过程（自由落体、扩散）和因果动作（数学运算）中的时序判断能力。

Result: 多数模型表现接近随机水平（50%），最佳模型在物理不可逆过程（人类准确率95%）和因果动作（人类99%）上的准确率仅达68%和81%。

Conclusion: 当前多模态系统缺乏时序连续性和因果关系的归纳偏置，建议通过发布AoT-PsyPhyBENCH数据集推动模型物理与时序推理能力发展。

Abstract: Modern vision-language models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet
their grasp of temporal information in video remains weak and, crucially,
under-evaluated. We probe this gap with a deceptively simple but revealing
challenge: judging the arrow of time (AoT)-whether a short clip is played
forward or backward. We introduce AoT-PsyPhyBENCH, a psychophysically validated
benchmark that tests whether VLMs can infer temporal direction in natural
videos using the same stimuli and behavioral baselines established for humans.
Our comprehensive evaluation of open-weight and proprietary, reasoning and
non-reasoning VLMs reveals that most models perform near chance, and even the
best lag far behind human accuracy on physically irreversible processes (e.g.,
free fall, diffusion/explosion) and causal manual actions (division/addition)
that humans recognize almost instantly. These results highlight a fundamental
gap in current multimodal systems: while they capture rich visual-semantic
correlations, they lack the inductive biases required for temporal continuity
and causal understanding. We release the code and data for AoT-PsyPhyBENCH to
encourage further progress in the physical and temporal reasoning capabilities
of VLMs.

Motivation: 现有自我改进范式在复杂推理任务（尾部数据）上表现不佳，导致模型陷入简单任务优化优先的失衡状态，形成制约性能提升的瓶颈

Method: 从数据分布重塑（distribution-reshaping）和学习轨迹重采样（trajectory-resampling）两个维度提出四种平衡策略，建立探索-学习过程的动态平衡机制

Result: 在Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct和InternVL2.5-4B模型上验证，视觉推理任务平均提升3.86个点，突破传统自改进方法的性能瓶颈

Conclusion: 头尾重平衡策略有效缓解了自改进过程中的马太效应，使模型在保持简单任务性能的同时，显著提升复杂推理能力，具有跨模型架构的通用性

Abstract: Self-improvement has emerged as a mainstream paradigm for advancing the
reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), where models
explore and learn from successful trajectories iteratively. However, we
identify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating
high-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles
with more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced
optimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while
hindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations,
this imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the "Matthew
effect"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to
performance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four
efficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and
trajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the
exploration-and-learning self-improvement process. Extensive experiments on
Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and InternVL2.5-4B models across visual reasoning tasks
demonstrate that our methods consistently improve visual reasoning
capabilities, outperforming vanilla self-improvement by 3.86 points on average.

Abstract: Recent video generation models can produce high-fidelity, temporally coherent
videos, indicating that they may encode substantial world knowledge. Beyond
realistic synthesis, they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual
perception, modeling, and manipulation. Yet, an important question still
remains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging
visual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to
comprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular
Veo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including
spatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically
characterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study,
we curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables
in-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our
findings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning
patterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and
locally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal
reasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. Overall, they are
not yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, but exhibit encouraging
signs as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.
