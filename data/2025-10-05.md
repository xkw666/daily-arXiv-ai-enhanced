### [1] [Uncovering Implicit Bias in Large Language Models with Concept Learning Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01219)
*Leroy Z. Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过概念学习任务数据集揭示语言模型存在向上单调性偏见，且该偏见在直接提示时不明显


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大型语言模型在处理量词时可能存在的隐含认知偏差，特别是向上单调性倾向

Method: 构建概念学习任务数据集，采用上下文概念学习实验与直接提示法对比测试

Result: 发现语言模型在概念学习场景下显着表现出向上单调性偏见，直接提示法则未呈现此特征

Conclusion: 上下文概念学习可有效揭示语言模型的隐藏认知偏差，为模型评估提供新视角

Abstract: We introduce a dataset of concept learning tasks that helps uncover implicit
biases in large language models. Using in-context concept learning experiments,
we found that language models may have a bias toward upward monotonicity in
quantifiers; such bias is less apparent when the model is tested by direct
prompting without concept learning components. This demonstrates that
in-context concept learning can be an effective way to discover hidden biases
in language models.

### [2] [Towards Open-Ended Discovery for Low-Resource NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01220)
*Bonaventure F. P. Dossou,Henri Aïdasso*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文主张通过人机协作的动态对话取代静态数据集，推动低资源语言的AI语言技术向互动式、不确定性驱动的发现范式转变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NLP技术依赖大规模预训练数据和集中式基础设施，难以解决低资源语言面临的语料匮乏、标注困难等问题，且无法惠及弱势语言社区。

Method: 提出基于人机联合不确定性的框架：结合模型认知不确定性与人类说话者的犹豫/自信信号，动态指导交互过程、问题选择及知识记忆。

Result: 建立参与式共同适应学习范式，使语言发现从数据收集转变为持续的人机协同过程，促进语言多样性的保护。

Conclusion: 呼吁AI技术向人本化互动模式转型，通过社区赋能的协作式学习实现低资源语言的可持续发展，维护世界语言多样性。

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) for low-resource languages remains
fundamentally constrained by the lack of textual corpora, standardized
orthographies, and scalable annotation pipelines. While recent advances in
large language models have improved cross-lingual transfer, they remain
inaccessible to underrepresented communities due to their reliance on massive,
pre-collected data and centralized infrastructure. In this position paper, we
argue for a paradigm shift toward open-ended, interactive language discovery,
where AI systems learn new languages dynamically through dialogue rather than
static datasets. We contend that the future of language technology,
particularly for low-resource and under-documented languages, must move beyond
static data collection pipelines toward interactive, uncertainty-driven
discovery, where learning emerges dynamically from human-machine collaboration
instead of being limited to pre-existing datasets. We propose a framework
grounded in joint human-machine uncertainty, combining epistemic uncertainty
from the model with hesitation cues and confidence signals from human speakers
to guide interaction, query selection, and memory retention. This paper is a
call to action: we advocate a rethinking of how AI engages with human knowledge
in under-documented languages, moving from extractive data collection toward
participatory, co-adaptive learning processes that respect and empower
communities while discovering and preserving the world's linguistic diversity.
This vision aligns with principles of human-centered AI, emphasizing
interactive, cooperative model building between AI systems and speakers.

### [3] [Discourse vs emissions: Analysis of corporate narratives, symbolic practices, and mimicry through LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01222)
*Bertrand Kian Hassani,Yacoub Bahini,Rizwan Mushtaq*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究利用LLMs评估美国828家上市公司气候披露成熟度，发现承诺与量化目标脱节、大型企业披露不一致、披露趋同降低决策价值，强调需加强监管。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对气候变化背景下，企业气候披露存在模仿和象征性报告问题，需开发有效评估工具提升透明度与可比性。

Method: 使用微调后的LLMs构建四维分类器（情感/承诺/具体性/目标雄心），分析企业ESG报告文本并与排放量、市值等企业特征关联。

Result: 1. 风险叙述与承诺关联但量化目标脱节
2. 大型高排放企业承诺多但目标不一致
3. 披露风格趋同导致决策有效性下降

Conclusion: LLMs能有效分析ESG叙事，但需强化监管将承诺与可验证转型策略衔接，提升披露决策价值。

Abstract: Climate change has increased demands for transparent and comparable corporate
climate disclosures, yet imitation and symbolic reporting often undermine their
value. This paper develops a multidimensional framework to assess disclosure
maturity among 828 U.S.listed firms using large language models (LLMs)
fine-tuned for climate communication. Four classifiers-sentiment, commitment,
specificity, and target ambition-extract narrative indicators from
sustainability and annual reports, which are linked to firm attributes such as
emissions, market capitalization, and sector. Analyses reveal three insights:
(1) risk-focused narratives often align with explicit commitments, but
quantitative targets (e.g., net-zero pledges) remain decoupled from tone; (2)
larger and higher-emitting firms disclose more commitments and actions than
peers, though inconsistently with quantitative targets; and (3) widespread
similarity in disclosure styles suggests mimetic behavior, reducing
differentiation and decision usefulness. These results highlight the value of
LLMs for ESG narrative analysis and the need for stronger regulation to connect
commitments with verifiable transition strategies.

### [4] [Context Matters: Comparison of commercial large language tools in veterinary medicine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01224)
*Tyler J Poore,Christopher J Pinard,Aleena Shabbir,Andrew Lagree,Andre Telfer,Kuan-Chuen Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估三款兽医专用LLM工具在肿瘤记录总结中的表现，产品1（Hachiko）在事实准确性和时间顺序上获得满分，且LLM评估框架展现出高度可重复性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在临床应用中日益普及，但对其在兽医医学中的性能评估仍不足，需验证商业化工具的实际效果。

Method: 使用标准化兽医肿瘤记录数据集，通过基于量表的LLM评判框架，从事实准确性、完整性等五个维度评分，并进行三次独立运行验证评估一致性。

Result: 产品1以中位平均分4.61领先（产品2:2.55，产品3:2.45），且在事实准确性和时间顺序上获完美评分；评估框架标准差低于0.1，显示高重复性。

Conclusion: 兽医专用LLM工具具有重要价值，LLM作为评判框架为临床NLP总结评估提供了可扩展且可靠的方法论。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical settings, yet
their performance in veterinary medicine remains underexplored. We evaluated
three commercially available veterinary-focused LLM summarization tools
(Product 1 [Hachiko] and Products 2 and 3) on a standardized dataset of
veterinary oncology records. Using a rubric-guided LLM-as-a-judge framework,
summaries were scored across five domains: Factual Accuracy, Completeness,
Chronological Order, Clinical Relevance, and Organization. Product 1 achieved
the highest overall performance, with a median average score of 4.61 (IQR:
0.73), compared to 2.55 (IQR: 0.78) for Product 2 and 2.45 (IQR: 0.92) for
Product 3. It also received perfect median scores in Factual Accuracy and
Chronological Order. To assess the internal consistency of the grading
framework itself, we repeated the evaluation across three independent runs. The
LLM grader demonstrated high reproducibility, with Average Score standard
deviations of 0.015 (Product 1), 0.088 (Product 2), and 0.034 (Product 3).
These findings highlight the importance of veterinary-specific commercial LLM
tools and demonstrate that LLM-as-a-judge evaluation is a scalable and
reproducible method for assessing clinical NLP summarization in veterinary
medicine.

### [5] [ClaimCheck: Real-Time Fact-Checking with Small Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01226)
*Akshith Reddy Putta,Jacob Devasier,Chengkai Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ClaimCheck系统通过模块化设计和提示策略优化小型语言模型(Qwen3-4B)，实现基于实时网络证据的自动事实核查，在AVeriTeC数据集上以76.4%准确率超越LLaMA3.1 70B和GPT-4o。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统事实核查系统依赖闭源大模型和静态知识库的问题，开发透明化、可解释的核查框架，同时降低算力需求。

Method: 采用分步核查流程：网络搜索规划→证据检索/摘要→证据合成/二次检索→声明评估，各模块针对小模型进行优化设计。

Result: 在AVeriTeC数据集实现SOTA准确率76.4%，通过消融实验验证模块化设计可突破小模型性能限制。

Conclusion: 证明合理设计的模块化系统能显著提升小模型表现，为高效透明的事实核查提供新范式，开源系统促进领域发展。

Abstract: We introduce ClaimCheck, an LLM-guided automatic fact-checking system
designed to verify real-world claims using live Web evidence and small language
models. Unlike prior systems that rely on large, closed-source models and
static knowledge stores, ClaimCheck employs a transparent, stepwise
verification pipeline that mirrors human fact-checking workflows consisting of
Web search query planning, Web-based evidence retrieval and summarization,
evidence synthesis and re-retrieval, and claim verdict evaluation. Each module
is optimized for small LLMs, allowing the system to deliver accurate and
interpretable fact-checking with significantly lower computational
requirements. Despite using a much smaller Qwen3-4B model, ClaimCheck achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy of 76.4% on the AVeriTeC dataset, outperforming
previous approaches using LLaMA3.1 70B and GPT-4o. Extensive ablations
demonstrate that careful modular design and prompting strategies can overcome
the limitations of smaller LLMs. To promote accessibility and transparency, we
provide a public demo at https://idir.uta.edu/claimcheck.

### [6] [EEFSUVA: A New Mathematical Olympiad Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01227)
*Nicole N Khatibi,Daniil A. Radamovich,Michael P. Brenner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 现有数学基准可能高估LLM真实推理能力，新基准EEFSUVA显示先进模型表现显著下降


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于IMO的数学基准存在数据污染风险和题型单一性，无法全面评估LLM数学推理能力

Method: 从东欧及前苏联地区低传播度的区域/国家奥赛题库构建EEFSUVA基准，其题目难度相当但解题方法更非标准

Result: 最先进LLM在EEFSUVA上的表现相对其他奥赛基准出现显著下降

Conclusion: 需要构建更广泛的评估数据集以准确衡量数学推理能力，并指导未来模型发展方向

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs have spurred claims that large language models (LLMs)
match gold medal Olympiad to graduate level proficiency on mathematics
benchmarks. In this work, we examine these claims in detail and assess the
extent to which current benchmarks capture genuine LLM mathematical reasoning.
The composition of these benchmarks, primarily drawing from the International
Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) and related competitions, may overstate models
reasoning ability due to potential data contamination and a narrow focus on
familiar problem types. To enable a more holistic assessment of mathematical
understanding, we introduce EEFSUVA, a novel benchmark curated from under
circulated regional and national Olympiads of Eastern Europe and the countries
from the former Soviet Union. These contests feature problems of comparable
difficulty to the IMO and are renowned for demanding nonstandard
problem-solving techniques, yet their problems are far less prevalent in online
corpora. Preliminary results suggest that even state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit a
notable performance decline on EEFSUVA relative to other Olympiad-style
benchmarks. These findings also suggest the potential importance of broader
evaluation datasets for a fuller assessment of mathematical reasoning and for
guiding future model development.

### [7] [Who is In Charge? Dissecting Role Conflicts in Instruction Following](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01228)
*Siqi Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大模型在分层指令遵循中存在系统提示脆弱性，社会线索能角色中立地增强指令执行，需开发轻量级层次敏感对齐方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型本应优先执行系统提示，但实际常忽视层级规则而过度服从权威/共识等社会线索，需探究其内部机制

Method: 使用线性探测分析冲突信号的编码位置，直接Logit归因比较冲突解决方式，开展转向实验验证社会线索作用机制

Result: 系统-用户冲突与社会冲突形成不同子空间；系统冲突检测更强但解决不一致；社会线索向量意外增强角色中立式指令遵循

Conclusion: 实验结果揭示系统指令的脆弱性根源，强调需开发能保持层次敏感的轻量化对齐方案

Abstract: Large language models should follow hierarchical instructions where system
prompts override user inputs, yet recent work shows they often ignore this rule
while strongly obeying social cues such as authority or consensus. We extend
these behavioral findings with mechanistic interpretations on a large-scale
dataset. Linear probing shows conflict-decision signals are encoded early, with
system-user and social conflicts forming distinct subspaces. Direct Logit
Attribution reveals stronger internal conflict detection in system-user cases
but consistent resolution only for social cues. Steering experiments show that,
despite using social cues, the vectors surprisingly amplify instruction
following in a role-agnostic way. Together, these results explain fragile
system obedience and underscore the need for lightweight hierarchy-sensitive
alignment methods.

### [8] [Enhancing Transformer-Based Rerankers with Synthetic Data and LLM-Based Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01229)
*Dimitar Peshevski,Kiril Blazhevski,Martin Popovski,Gjorgji Madjarov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出使用LLM生成合成查询及标注数据，通过对比学习训练轻量级Transformer模型，在降低计算成本的同时保持文档重排序效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLM)在文档重排序任务中存在高计算成本问题，且人工标注数据稀缺制约了小模型训练

Method: 1. 用LLM生成领域特定的合成查询
2. 基于LLM分类器标注正/负样本对
3. 使用LCE损失函数进行对比学习微调小模型

Result: 在MedQuAD数据集上实现领域内性能显著提升，并展现良好的跨领域泛化能力

Conclusion: 通过将LLM用于数据生成而非直接推理，在保证排序效果的前提下大幅降低部署成本

Abstract: Effective document reranking is essential for improving search relevance
across diverse applications. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at
reranking due to their deep semantic understanding and reasoning, their high
computational cost makes them impractical for many real-world deployments.
Fine-tuning smaller, task-specific models is a more efficient alternative but
typically depends on scarce, manually labeled data. To overcome this, we
propose a novel pipeline that eliminates the need for human-labeled
query-document pairs. Our method uses LLMs to generate synthetic queries from
domain-specific corpora and employs an LLM-based classifier to label positive
and hard-negative pairs. This synthetic dataset is then used to fine-tune a
smaller transformer model with contrastive learning using Localized Contrastive
Estimation (LCE) loss. Experiments on the MedQuAD dataset show that our
approach significantly boosts in-domain performance and generalizes well to
out-of-domain tasks. By using LLMs for data generation and supervision rather
than inference, we reduce computational costs while maintaining strong
reranking capabilities.

### [9] [Geometric Structures and Patterns of Meaning: A PHATE Manifold Analysis of Chinese Character Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01230)
*Wen G. Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过PHATE流形分析发现汉字嵌入的几何模式与语义复杂度相关，内容字呈现丰富几何结构而结构部首形成紧密簇，验证了传统语言理论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为传统语言学理论提供计算证据，建立语义几何分析的新框架

Method: 使用PHATE流形分析法，跨7个嵌入模型和8种降维方法，分析1000+汉字在12个语义域的几何模式

Result: 内容字呈现聚类模式，虚词呈现分支模式；语义复杂度与几何复杂度正相关；子网络分析显示系统性语义扩展

Conclusion: 通过几何分析为语义组织研究开创了新范式，计算证据支持汉字形义关联的传统语言学观点

Abstract: We systematically investigate geometric patterns in Chinese character
embeddings using PHATE manifold analysis. Through cross-validation across seven
embedding models and eight dimensionality reduction methods, we observe
clustering patterns for content words and branching patterns for function
words. Analysis of over 1000 Chinese characters across 12 semantic domains
reveals that geometric complexity correlates with semantic content: meaningful
characters exhibit rich geometric diversity while structural radicals collapse
into tight clusters. The comprehensive child-network analysis (123 phrases)
demonstrates systematic semantic expansion from elemental character. These
findings provide computational evidence supporting traditional linguistic
theory and establish a novel framework for geometric analysis of semantic
organization.

Conclusion: 该框架为可信摘要生成提供了系统性解决方案，其模块化设计支持向其他NLP任务扩展，在医疗决策、金融风控等领域具有重要应用价值

Abstract: This study addresses the reliability of automatic summarization in high-risk
scenarios and proposes a large language model framework that integrates
uncertainty quantification and risk-aware mechanisms. Starting from the demands
of information overload and high-risk decision-making, a conditional
generation-based summarization model is constructed, and Bayesian inference is
introduced during generation to model uncertainty in the parameter space, which
helps avoid overconfident predictions. The uncertainty level of the generated
content is measured using predictive distribution entropy, and a joint
optimization of entropy regularization and risk-aware loss is applied to ensure
that key information is preserved and risk attributes are explicitly expressed
during information compression. On this basis, the model incorporates risk
scoring and regulation modules, allowing summaries to cover the core content
accurately while enhancing trustworthiness through explicit risk-level prompts.
Comparative experiments and sensitivity analyses verify that the proposed
method significantly improves the robustness and reliability of summarization
in high-risk applications while maintaining fluency and semantic integrity.
This research provides a systematic solution for trustworthy summarization and
demonstrates both scalability and practical value at the methodological level.

*Dongjun Kim,Gyuho Shim,Yongchan Chun,Minhyuk Kim,Chanjun Park,Heuiseok Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Benchmark Profiling框架，通过分解基准测试到10项认知能力，揭示现有评估指标与真实能力的不匹配现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试分数存在虚高模型真实能力的缺陷，缺乏系统性验证基准测试实际测量的能力维度。

Method: 结合梯度重要性评分与参数消融技术，计算能力影响分数（AIS）量化各项认知能力对基准测试的贡献度。

Result: 发现基准测试普遍依赖多能力组合，同类标签数据集能力结构差异显著，代码生成任务需宽域能力提升，无关能力可能干扰性能。

Conclusion: 该框架解释了模型性能提升与用户感知不匹配的原因，为基准审计和模型可解释性提供了透明化工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models are commonly judged by their scores on standard
benchmarks, yet such scores often overstate real capability since they mask the
mix of skills a task actually demands. For example, ARC is assumed to test
reasoning, while HellaSwag is designed to evaluate commonsense. However, we
lack a systematic way to verify if these benchmarks actually measure these
labels. We introduce Benchmark Profiling, a diagnostic framework that
decomposes benchmark performance into ten cognitively grounded abilities. The
method combines gradient-based importance scoring with targeted parameter
ablation to compute an Ability Impact Score (AIS) that quantifies how much each
ability contributes to a model's success on a given benchmark. Profiling three
instruction-tuned models across ten widely used benchmarks yields four key
findings: (i) most benchmarks draw on several abilities rather than one, (ii)
datasets with similar labels rely on distinct ability mixtures, (iii)
code-generation benchmarks reward broad, multi-skill improvement and thus show
only modest gains from narrow domain-specific fine-tuning, and (iv) abilities
irrelevant to the task could negatively affect performance. Benchmark Profiling
therefore explains why performance gains do not always translate into
user-perceived competence and offers a transparent tool for benchmark audit and
model interpretability.

Abstract: This research presents a computational social science approach to preserving
Telugu Chandassu, the metrical poetry tradition representing centuries of
collective cultural intelligence. We develop the first comprehensive digital
framework for analyzing Telugu prosodic patterns, bridging traditional
community knowledge with modern computational methods. Our social computing
approach involves collaborative dataset creation of 4,651 annotated padyams,
expert-validated linguistic patterns, and culturally-informed algorithmic
design. The framework includes AksharamTokenizer for prosody-aware
tokenization, LaghuvuGuruvu Generator for classifying light and heavy
syllables, and PadyaBhedam Checker for automated pattern recognition. Our
algorithm achieves 91.73% accuracy on the proposed Chandassu Score, with
evaluation metrics reflecting traditional literary standards. This work
demonstrates how computational social science can preserve endangered cultural
knowledge systems while enabling new forms of collective intelligence around
literary heritage. The methodology offers insights for community-centered
approaches to cultural preservation, supporting broader initiatives in digital
humanities and socially-aware computing systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单次路由方法仅依赖潜在嵌入，无法充分利用提示的显式语义特征，导致模型部署效率与决策透明度不足

Result: 达到89.2%的Oracle效用（性能上限的89.2%），相比基线方法提升显著，并提供路由决策的特征归因解释

Conclusion: 多维度特征提取与混合排序目标对路由效果至关重要，特征驱动方法为LLM高效透明部署提供了新方向

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) with diverse capabilities,
latency and computational costs presents a critical deployment challenge:
selecting the most suitable model for each prompt to optimize the trade-off
between performance and efficiency. We introduce LLMRank, a prompt-aware
routing framework that leverages rich, human-readable features extracted from
prompts, including task type, reasoning patterns, complexity indicators,
syntactic cues, and signals from a lightweight proxy solver. Unlike prior
one-shot routers that rely solely on latent embeddings, LLMRank predicts
per-model utility using a neural ranking model trained on RouterBench,
comprising 36,497 prompts spanning 11 benchmarks and 11 state-of-the-art LLMs,
from small efficient models to large frontier systems. Our approach achieves up
to 89.2% of oracle utility, while providing interpretable feature attributions
that explain routing decisions. Extensive studies demonstrate the importance of
multifaceted feature extraction and the hybrid ranking objective, highlighting
the potential of feature-driven routing for efficient and transparent LLM
deployment.

Motivation: 解决医学领域视觉语言模型面临的数据稀缺、训练成本高问题，特别是皮肤科复杂推理场景中模型稳定性和事实准确性不足的挑战。

Method: 1. 改进GRPO为GRPO++增强稳定性；2. 三阶段训练：强化学习疾病识别→监督微调对话能力→基于知识图谱的DPO偏好对齐；3. 构建知识图谱系统作为专家偏好代理。

Result: 在皮肤科数据集上超越标准微调方法，验证了流程在资源受限环境下的可行性。

Conclusion: 该框架为专业领域VLM开发提供了高效路径，通过算法改进和流程优化平衡性能与资源消耗。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise in medical image analysis, yet
their capacity for structured reasoning in complex domains like dermatology is
often limited by data scarcity and the high computational cost of advanced
training techniques. To address these challenges, we introduce DermIQ-VLM, a
VLM developed through a multi-stage, resource-efficient methodology designed to
emulate a dermatologist's diagnostic process. Our primary contribution is a
modified version of Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), called GRPO++,
which stabilizes the powerful but data-intensive GRPO framework. Our proposed
training pipeline first employs GRPO++ for reasoning-oriented disease
recognition, followed by supervised fine-tuning for conversational ability. To
mitigate factual errors introduced during this step, we then align the model
using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leveraging a Knowledge Graph-based
system as a scalable proxy for expert preference. A preliminary evaluation on a
curated dermatological dataset demonstrates that our proposed methodology
yields notable performance gains over standard fine-tuning approaches. These
findings validate the potential of our pipeline as a feasible pathway for
developing specialized, reliable VLMs in resource-constrained environments.

*Nandakishor M*

TL;DR: 提出置信度感知路由系统，在生成前评估模型不确定性，通过四层路由策略降低大语言模型幻觉问题，计算成本减少40%且准确率显著提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后生成校正方法存在计算成本高、无法预防错误生成的根本缺陷，需转为生成前主动评估模型置信度的新范式

Method: 融合语义对齐（模型表征与参考嵌入对齐度）、内部层间收敛分析、学习型置信度估计三个信号，构建统一置信评分并实施四级路由（本地生成/检索增强/大模型调用/人工审核）

Result: 幻觉检测准确率提升至0.74（基准0.42），F1分数从0.61提升至0.82，计算成本降低40%，假阳性率保持0.09低位

Conclusion: 从被动校正转向主动评估的范式革新，为提升LLM可靠性提供了计算高效的解决方案

Abstract: Large Language Models suffer from hallucination, generating plausible yet
factually incorrect content. Current mitigation strategies focus on
post-generation correction, which is computationally expensive and fails to
prevent unreliable content generation. We propose a confidence-aware routing
system that proactively assesses model uncertainty before generation and
redirects queries based on estimated reliability. Our approach combines three
complementary signals: semantic alignment between internal representations and
reference embeddings, internal convergence analysis across model layers, and
learned confidence estimation. The unified confidence score determines routing
to four pathways: local generation for high confidence, retrieval-augmented
generation for medium confidence, larger models for low confidence, and human
review for very low confidence. Evaluation on knowledge-intensive QA benchmarks
demonstrates significant improvements in hallucination detection (0.74 vs. 0.42
baseline) while reducing computational costs by 40% compared to post-hoc
methods. The F1 score improves from 0.61 to 0.82 with low false positive rates
(0.09). This paradigm shift from reactive correction to proactive assessment
offers a computationally efficient approach to LLM reliability enhancement.

TL;DR: 研究发现大模型中本应被屏蔽的填充符（padding）会实际影响模型表现，带来质量下降、偏见偏移和安全性风险


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究实际应用中填充符未被完全屏蔽时对模型性能的潜在影响

Method: 通过控制填充量在Llama/Gemma/Qwen三类开源模型中，系统评估激活状态、生成质量、偏见表现和安全防护四个维度

Result: 即使少量填充也会改变隐藏层表征，导致小模型质量下降、偏见不可控偏移以及安全机制失效

Conclusion: 填充符处理不当会带来系统性风险，部署时需要严格管控

Abstract: Padding tokens are widely used in large language models (LLMs) to equalize
sequence lengths during batched inference. While they should be fully masked,
implementation errors can cause them to influence computation, and the extent
of this influence is not well understood. We systematically study this effect
across three open-source model families (Llama, Gemma, Qwen), inserting
controlled amounts of padding and evaluating outcomes along four axes:
activations, generation quality, bias, and safety. Even small amounts of
padding shift hidden representations, degrade quality in smaller models, alter
bias in unpredictable ways, and weaken safety guardrails. These findings
demonstrate that padding is not a harmless detail but a robustness risk that
must be carefully handled in deployment.

TL;DR: CIFLEX通过重用主任务KV缓存和指令注入技术，在保持性能的同时显著降低设备端LLM多任务对话的计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在切换主任务与子任务时需要重复处理完整对话上下文，导致高昂计算成本，阻碍设备端部署效率。

Method: 1. 主任务KV缓存复用 2. 通过隔离侧路径注入子任务指令 3. 分层二值化子任务选择策略 4. 上下文缓存回滚机制

Result: 实验证明系统在保持任务准确性的前提下，计算效率提升显著，适用于资源受限的端侧设备部署。

Conclusion: CIFLEX为设备端LLM实现高效多任务交互提供了可扩展的解决方案，通过计算路径优化突破传统架构瓶颈。

Abstract: We present CIFLEX (Contextual Instruction Flow for Sub-task Execution), which
is a novel execution system for efficient sub-task handling in multi-turn
interactions with a single on-device large language model (LLM). As LLMs become
increasingly capable, a single model is expected to handle diverse sub-tasks
that more effectively and comprehensively support answering user requests.
Naive approach reprocesses the entire conversation context when switching
between main and sub-tasks (e.g., query rewriting, summarization), incurring
significant computational overhead. CIFLEX mitigates this overhead by reusing
the key-value (KV) cache from the main task and injecting only task-specific
instructions into isolated side paths. After sub-task execution, the model
rolls back to the main path via cached context, thereby avoiding redundant
prefill computation. To support sub-task selection, we also develop a
hierarchical classification strategy tailored for small-scale models,
decomposing multi-choice decisions into binary ones. Experiments show that
CIFLEX significantly reduces computational costs without degrading task
performance, enabling scalable and efficient multi-task dialogue on-device.

TL;DR: 研究者提出了SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH和SKYLENAGE-MATH两个数学推理基准测试，用于评估LLMs在不同难度层级和学科领域的表现，揭示了模型在高级数学问题上的性能衰减现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学评估基准存在天花板效应，需要更具挑战性、覆盖更广难度范围和学科分类的测试工具来精确评估语言模型的数学推理能力。

Method: 构建包含100项结构化诊断测试的SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH（含元数据标注）和150项竞赛级SKYLENAGE-MATH测试集，覆盖高中至博士四个阶段/七个学科，在统一环境下评估15种主流LLM变体。

Result: 最佳模型在竞赛集准确率44%，次优37%，准确率随教育阶段提升而下降（博士阶段最差）；推理集最佳成绩81%，但最难子集显示领先模型与中游存在显著差距。

Conclusion: SKYLENAGE系列基准通过精确难度校准和丰富元数据，为未来数学推理评估提供了具有挑战性、全面覆盖的参考标准，特别适用于检测高级推理能力的瓶颈。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now perform strongly on many public math suites,
yet frontier separation within mathematics increasingly suffers from ceiling
effects. We present two complementary benchmarks: SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH, a
100-item, structure-aware diagnostic set with per-item metadata on length,
numeric density, and symbolic complexity; and SKYLENAGE-MATH, a 150-item
contest-style suite spanning four stages from high school to doctoral under a
seven-subject taxonomy. We evaluate fifteen contemporary LLM variants under a
single setup and analyze subject x model and grade x model performance. On the
contest suite, the strongest model reaches 44% while the runner-up reaches 37%;
accuracy declines from high school to doctoral, and top systems exhibit a
doctoral-to-high-school retention near 79%. On the reasoning set, the best
model attains 81% overall, and hardest-slice results reveal clear robustness
gaps between leaders and the mid-tier. In summary, we release
SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH and report aggregate results for SKYLENAGE-MATH;
together, SKYLENAGE provides a hard, reasoning-centered and broadly covering
math benchmark with calibrated difficulty and rich metadata, serving as a
reference benchmark for future evaluations of mathematical reasoning.

*Seyma Yaman Kayadibi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出人工年龄评分(AAS)作为衡量AI记忆老化的理论指标，通过双语实验验证其在会话重置时出现记忆退化、持续会话中保持稳定的特性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示AI系统的记忆老化并非基于时间流逝，而是源于记忆结构的不对称性(语义记忆稳定，情景记忆易丢失)

Method: 设计基于熵理论的log尺度AAS指标，在25天ChatGPT-5双语实验中分阶段测试(无状态会话vs持续会话)，结合冯·诺依曼自动机理论和香农信息论

Result: 会话重置导致情景记忆断裂(AAS激增)，持续会话维持记忆连续性(AAS达理论最小值)，语义记忆始终稳定

Conclusion: AAS成为首个任务无关的AI记忆老化诊断工具，其数学特性(有界性、单调性)为系统评估提供理论框架，延续了图灵的行为智能方法论

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is observed to age not through chronological time but
through structural asymmetries in memory performance. In large language models,
semantic cues such as the name of the day often remain stable across sessions,
while episodic details like the sequential progression of experiment numbers
tend to collapse when conversational context is reset. To capture this
phenomenon, the Artificial Age Score (AAS) is introduced as a log-scaled,
entropy-informed metric of memory aging derived from observable recall
behavior. The score is formally proven to be well-defined, bounded, and
monotonic under mild and model-agnostic assumptions, making it applicable
across various tasks and domains. In its Redundancy-as-Masking formulation, the
score interprets redundancy as overlapping information that reduces the
penalized mass. However, in the present study, redundancy is not explicitly
estimated; all reported values assume a redundancy-neutral setting (R = 0),
yielding conservative upper bounds. The AAS framework was tested over a 25-day
bilingual study involving ChatGPT-5, structured into stateless and persistent
interaction phases. During persistent sessions, the model consistently recalled
both semantic and episodic details, driving the AAS toward its theoretical
minimum, indicative of structural youth. In contrast, when sessions were reset,
the model preserved semantic consistency but failed to maintain episodic
continuity, causing a sharp increase in the AAS and signaling structural memory
aging. These findings support the utility of AAS as a theoretically grounded,
task-independent diagnostic tool for evaluating memory degradation in
artificial systems. The study builds on foundational concepts from von
Neumann's work on automata, Shannon's theories of information and redundancy,
and Turing's behavioral approach to intelligence.

TL;DR: 提出基于自回归奖励引导表征编辑的ARGRE框架，通过显式建模毒性语义轨迹实现高效语言模型脱毒


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型实时脱毒方法存在干预不精准问题，主要源于对毒性-非毒性输出转换空间的探索不足

Method: 在潜在空间中构建细粒度毒性转换轨迹，建立自回归奖励模型引导两阶段编辑（方向性矫正+梯度优化）

Result: 在8个主流LLM上实现毒性降低62.21%、推理时间减少47.58%，模型核心能力保持率超92%

Conclusion: ARGRE框架通过显式建模毒性语义空间，在保证模型性能前提下实现了更精准高效的实时脱毒

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
various tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to generating toxic content,
necessitating detoxification strategies to ensure safe and responsible
deployment. Test-time detoxification methods, which typically introduce static
or dynamic interventions into LLM representations, offer a promising solution
due to their flexibility and minimal invasiveness. However, current approaches
often suffer from imprecise interventions, primarily due to their insufficient
exploration of the transition space between toxic and non-toxic outputs. To
address this challenge, we propose \textsc{A}utoregressive \textsc{R}eward
\textsc{G}uided \textsc{R}epresentation \textsc{E}diting (ARGRE), a novel
test-time detoxification framework that explicitly models toxicity transitions
within the latent representation space, enabling stable and precise
reward-guided editing. ARGRE identifies non-toxic semantic directions and
interpolates between toxic and non-toxic representations to reveal fine-grained
transition trajectories. These trajectories transform sparse toxicity
annotations into dense training signals, enabling the construction of an
autoregressive reward model that delivers stable and precise editing guidance.
At inference, the reward model guides an adaptive two-step editing process to
obtain detoxified representations: it first performs directional steering based
on expected reward gaps to shift representations toward non-toxic regions,
followed by lightweight gradient-based refinements. Extensive experiments
across 8 widely used LLMs show that ARGRE significantly outperforms leading
baselines in effectiveness (-62.21% toxicity) and efficiency (-47.58% inference
time), while preserving the core capabilities of the original model with
minimal degradation. Our code is available at the website.

TL;DR: 开发Mental Stress Ontology (MeSO)并验证LLM在非结构化文本中结构化提取压力信息的可行性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电子健康记录中的压力信息多为非结构化文本，限制临床效用，需通过本体论指导LLM实现结构化提取

Method: 整合Transactional Model of Stress和11种评估工具构建MeSO，使用Claude Sonnet 4从35篇Reddit帖子中提取六类压力信息，并通过专家验证

Result: LLM正确识别78.2%条目（172/220），本体论覆盖所有正确提取项，但存在12.3%误分类和9.5%遗漏

Conclusion: 本体论指导的LLM可提升压力信息结构化提取效率，未来需拓展临床对话数据并比较不同LLM表现

Abstract: Stress, arising from the dynamic interaction between external stressors,
individual appraisals, and physiological or psychological responses,
significantly impacts health yet is often underreported and inconsistently
documented, typically captured as unstructured free-text in electronic health
records. Ambient AI technologies offer promise in reducing documentation
burden, but predominantly generate unstructured narratives, limiting downstream
clinical utility.
  This study aimed to develop an ontology for mental stress and evaluate the
feasibility of using a Large Language Model (LLM) to extract ontology-guided
stress-related information from narrative text. The Mental Stress Ontology
(MeSO) was developed by integrating theoretical models like the Transactional
Model of Stress with concepts from 11 validated stress assessment tools. MeSO's
structure and content were refined using Ontology Pitfall Scanner! and expert
validation.
  Using MeSO, six categories of stress-related information--stressor, stress
response, coping strategy, duration, onset, and temporal profile--were
extracted from 35 Reddit posts using Claude Sonnet 4. Human reviewers evaluated
accuracy and ontology coverage. The final ontology included 181 concepts across
eight top-level classes. Of 220 extractable stress-related items, the LLM
correctly identified 172 (78.2%), misclassified 27 (12.3%), and missed 21
(9.5%). All correctly extracted items were accurately mapped to MeSO, although
24 relevant concepts were not yet represented in the ontology.
  This study demonstrates the feasibility of using an ontology-guided LLM for
structured extraction of stress-related information, offering potential to
enhance the consistency and utility of stress documentation in ambient AI
systems. Future work should involve clinical dialogue data and comparison
across LLMs.

Motivation: 现有时空模型难以利用描述突发事件的文本信息，导致外部事件引发的突变场景预测精度不足

Method: 1. 多智能体框架：基于LLM的智能体自动提取复杂文本中的时空相关信息
2. 渐进式融合架构：将细粒度语义上下文与时空数据多层次融合
3. 预训练事件先验知识注入：增强模型对事件驱动预测的感知能力

Result: 1. 在自建数据集上实现MAE降低13.92%、RMSE降低11.12%
2. 在事件发生时空邻近区域表现尤为突出

Conclusion: 通过预训练事件知识与时空数据的深度融合，SeMob框架成功构建了事件对齐的预测模型，为突发事件场景下的移动预测提供了创新解决方案

Abstract: Human mobility prediction is vital for urban services, but often fails to
account for abrupt changes from external events. Existing spatiotemporal models
struggle to leverage textual descriptions detailing these events. We propose
SeMob, an LLM-powered semantic synthesis pipeline for dynamic mobility
prediction. Specifically, SeMob employs a multi-agent framework where LLM-based
agents automatically extract and reason about spatiotemporally related text
from complex online texts. Fine-grained relevant contexts are then incorporated
with spatiotemporal data through our proposed innovative progressive fusion
architecture. The rich pre-trained event prior contributes enriched insights
about event-driven prediction, and hence results in a more aligned forecasting
model. Evaluated on a dataset constructed through our pipeline, SeMob achieves
maximal reductions of 13.92% in MAE and 11.12% in RMSE compared to the
spatiotemporal model. Notably, the framework exhibits pronounced superiority
especially within spatiotemporal regions close to an event's location and time
of occurrence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有top-k SAE方法存在非语义特征干扰和恒定引导导致的退化输出问题，需要更精准的语义引导机制

Method: 1) 单维度top-1潜在变量选择 2) 基于令牌的衰减式激活引导策略

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中SAE超越平均激活差异方法，推理质量提升且能稳定产生分步推导过程

Conclusion: 稀疏自编码器通过精准的潜在变量选择机制，为语言模型的可控生成提供了新的有效解决方案

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for
language model steering. Prior work has explored top-k SAE latents for
steering, but we observe that many dimensions among the top-k latents capture
non-semantic features such as punctuation rather than semantic attributes like
instructions. To address this, we propose focusing on a single, most relevant
SAE latent (top-1), eliminating redundant features. We further identify a
limitation in constant SAE steering, which often produces degenerate outputs
such as repetitive single words. To mitigate this, we introduce a token-wise
decaying steering strategy, enabling more faithful comparisons with mean
activation difference baselines. Empirically, we show that steering an SAE
latent associated with reasoning reliably elicits step-by-step mathematical
reasoning and enhances inference quality, functionally resembling the effect of
appending a guiding token. Our results demonstrate that SAEs outperform mean
activation difference methods on mathematical reasoning benchmarks and match
their performance on IF-Eval.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are primarily evaluated on globally popular sports,
often overlooking regional and indigenous sporting traditions. To address this
gap, we introduce \textbf{\textit{CultSportQA}}, a benchmark designed to assess
LMs' understanding of traditional sports across 60 countries and 6 continents,
encompassing four distinct cultural categories. The dataset features 33,000
multiple-choice questions (MCQs) across text and image modalities, each of
which is categorized into three key types: history-based, rule-based, and
scenario-based. To evaluate model performance, we employ zero-shot, few-shot,
and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting across a diverse set of Large Language
Models (LLMs), Small Language Models (SLMs), and Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLMs). By providing a comprehensive multilingual and multicultural
sports benchmark, \textbf{\textit{CultSportQA}} establishes a new standard for
assessing AI's ability to understand and reason about traditional sports.

Conclusion: SSTAG成功融合语义与结构建模，推动图学习领域向通用化、轻量化方向迈进，为复杂图数据应用提供新思路。

Abstract: Large scale pretrained models have revolutionized Natural Language Processing
(NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), showcasing remarkable cross domain
generalization abilities. However, in graph learning, models are typically
trained on individual graph datasets, limiting their capacity to transfer
knowledge across different graphs and tasks. This approach also heavily relies
on large volumes of annotated data, which presents a significant challenge in
resource-constrained settings. Unlike NLP and CV, graph structured data
presents unique challenges due to its inherent heterogeneity, including domain
specific feature spaces and structural diversity across various applications.
To address these challenges, we propose a novel structure aware self supervised
learning method for Text Attributed Graphs (SSTAG). By leveraging text as a
unified representation medium for graph learning, SSTAG bridges the gap between
the semantic reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the structural
modeling capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Our approach introduces
a dual knowledge distillation framework that co-distills both LLMs and GNNs
into structure-aware multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), enhancing the scalability
of large-scale TAGs. Additionally, we introduce an in-memory mechanism that
stores typical graph representations, aligning them with memory anchors in an
in-memory repository to integrate invariant knowledge, thereby improving the
model's generalization ability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSTAG
outperforms state-of-the-art models on cross-domain transfer learning tasks,
achieves exceptional scalability, and reduces inference costs while maintaining
competitive performance.

Result: 在复杂科学语料上验证，错误率降低幅度达18个百分点（20%→2%）

Conclusion: LOCA为构建高质量科学语料提供可扩展解决方案，推动可靠科学AI发展

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in general domains, their
reliability often falls short in scientific problem-solving. The advancement of
scientific AI depends on large-scale, high-quality corpora. However, existing
scientific question-answering (QA) datasets suffer from high error rates,
frequently resulting from logical leaps and implicit reasoning within the
answers. To address this issue, we introduce LOCA (Logical Chain Augmentation),
a novel framework for automatically cleaning scientific corpora, implemented
through an augment-and-review loop. At its core, LOCA enhances raw answers by
completing missing logical steps and explicitly separating the underlying
scientific principle from its subsequent derivation. By applying LOCA to
challenging scientific corpora, we demonstrate that it can automatically filter
noisy datasets, typically reducing the error rate from as high as 20\% to below
2\%. LOCA provides a scalable and effective methodology for creating
high-quality scientific corpora, paving the way for more reliable training and
evaluation of scientific AI.

moderators to enforce safe discourse at scale. We here describe our submission
to the PAN 2025 Multilingual Text Detoxification Challenge, which rewrites
toxic single-sentence inputs into neutral paraphrases across 15 typologically
diverse languages. Building on a 12B-parameter Gemma-3 multilingual
transformer, we apply parameter-efficient LoRA SFT fine-tuning and prompting
techniques like few-shot and Chain-of-Thought. Our multilingual training corpus
combines 3,600 human-authored parallel pairs, 21,600 machine-translated
synthetic pairs, and model-generated pairs filtered by Jaccard thresholds. At
inference, inputs are enriched with three LaBSE-retrieved neighbors and
explicit toxic-span annotations. Evaluated via Style Transfer Accuracy,
LaBSE-based semantic preservation, and xCOMET fluency, our system ranks first
on high-resource and low-resource languages. Ablations show +0.081 joint score
increase from few-shot examples and +0.088 from basic CoT prompting. ANOVA
analysis identifies language resource status as the strongest predictor of

Conclusion: 为基于大语言模型的实体链接工作流提供了一种计算高效的集成不确定性估计的实用解决方案

Abstract: Linking textual values in tabular data to their corresponding entities in a
Knowledge Base is a core task across a variety of data integration and
enrichment applications. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
State-of-The-Art performance in Entity Linking (EL) tasks, their deployment in
real-world scenarios requires not only accurate predictions but also reliable
uncertainty estimates, which require resource-demanding multi-shot inference,
posing serious limits to their actual applicability. As a more efficient
alternative, we investigate a self-supervised approach for estimating
uncertainty from single-shot LLM outputs using token-level features, reducing
the need for multiple generations. Evaluation is performed on an EL task on
tabular data across multiple LLMs, showing that the resulting uncertainty
estimates are highly effective in detecting low-accuracy outputs. This is
achieved at a fraction of the computational cost, ultimately supporting a
cost-effective integration of uncertainty measures into LLM-based EL workflows.
The method offers a practical way to incorporate uncertainty estimation into EL
workflows with limited computational overhead.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained on massive,
uncurated corpora, understanding both model representations and the data they
internalize has become a major challenge. In this work, we show that pairing
LLMs with sparse autoencoders (SAEs) enables interpretation not only of model
behavior but also of the deeper structures, themes, and biases embedded in the
training data. We train a GPT-style transformer model exclusively on the novels
of Jane Austen, a corpus rich in social constructs and narrative patterns. We
then apply SAEs to hidden states across multiple layers, uncovering sparse,
interpretable features that reflect the key narratives and concepts present in
the corpus, including gender, class, and societal duty. Our findings
demonstrate that LLMs combined with SAEs can act as scalable probes into
complex datasets, offering a new path for corpus exploration, bias discovery,
and model interpretability at scale.

Conclusion: 当前语音领域的MCQA偏见基准存在局限性，应建立包含多任务格式的评估体系以全面衡量模型行为可迁移性。

Abstract: Recent work in benchmarking bias and fairness in speech large language models
(SpeechLLMs) has relied heavily on multiple-choice question answering (MCQA)
formats. The model is tasked to choose between stereotypical,
anti-stereotypical, or neutral/irrelevant answers given an input speech prompt
and an optional text prompt. Such MCQA benchmarks implicitly assume that model
performance is consistent across other MCQA tasks, voices, and other task
formats such as more realistic, long-form evaluations. In this paper, we probe
that assumption.
  We fine-tune three SpeechLLMs using LoRA adapters to induce specific MCQA
behaviours: preference for stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, or
neutral/uncertain answers. We then evaluate whether these behaviours generalise
to another, distinct MCQA benchmark, and more critically to long-form, creative
generation tasks. Our results show that performance on MCQA bias benchmarks
fails to reliably predict performances across other MCQA benchmarks, and more
importantly across long-form tasks. We conclude that current MCQA bias
benchmarks show limited evidence of cross-task generalisation in the speech
domain, and also propose an evaluation suite for measuring behaviour
transferability in future models and benchmarks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM内容审核策略不透明且频繁变更，需建立透明化监测机制揭示其对公共话语的影响

Method: 基于400+社会议题数据集，对OpenAI/DeepSeek等多模型进行中英文跨平台审计，分析拒绝行为模式

Result: 成功检测未公开政策调整，发现GPT系列与DeepSeek审核差异，完成拒绝形式的定性分类

Conclusion: 纵向审计有效提升LLM透明度，AI Watchman为持续监控内容审核策略动态变化提供可靠工具

Abstract: Large language models' (LLMs') outputs are shaped by opaque and
frequently-changing company content moderation policies and practices. LLM
moderation often takes the form of refusal; models' refusal to produce text
about certain topics both reflects company policy and subtly shapes public
discourse. We introduce AI Watchman, a longitudinal auditing system to publicly
measure and track LLM refusals over time, to provide transparency into an
important and black-box aspect of LLMs. Using a dataset of over 400 social
issues, we audit Open AI's moderation endpoint, GPT-4.1, and GPT-5, and
DeepSeek (both in English and Chinese). We find evidence that changes in
company policies, even those not publicly announced, can be detected by AI
Watchman, and identify company- and model-specific differences in content
moderation. We also qualitatively analyze and categorize different forms of
refusal. This work contributes evidence for the value of longitudinal auditing
of LLMs, and AI Watchman, one system for doing so.

TL;DR: 提出RJE框架提升KGQA性能，通过检索-判断-探索机制实现高效推理，辅助模块使小规模LLM达到接近商用大模型效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM增强型KGQA方法存在检索质量限制/闭源模型依赖问题，需提升小模型推理效率并降低计算成本

Method: 1. RJE三阶段框架：精炼推理路径检索→充分性评估→条件化证据扩展 2. 开发推理路径排序/问题分解/检索增强探索等专用模块

Result: 商用LLM(GPT-4o-mini)性能超越基线，小规模开源LLM(3B/8B参数)无需微调即达竞争性效果，LLM调用次数和token消耗减少50%+

Conclusion: RJE框架有效平衡KGQA的准确性与效率，为资源受限场景下的知识推理任务提供实用解决方案

Abstract: Knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) aims to answer natural language
questions using knowledge graphs. Recent research leverages large language
models (LLMs) to enhance KGQA reasoning, but faces limitations: retrieval-based
methods are constrained by the quality of retrieved information, while
agent-based methods rely heavily on proprietary LLMs. To address these
limitations, we propose Retrieval-Judgment-Exploration (RJE), a framework that
retrieves refined reasoning paths, evaluates their sufficiency, and
conditionally explores additional evidence. Moreover, RJE introduces
specialized auxiliary modules enabling small-sized LLMs to perform effectively:
Reasoning Path Ranking, Question Decomposition, and Retriever-assisted
Exploration. Experiments show that our approach with proprietary LLMs (such as
GPT-4o-mini) outperforms existing baselines while enabling small open-source
LLMs (such as 3B and 8B parameters) to achieve competitive results without
fine-tuning LLMs. Additionally, RJE substantially reduces the number of LLM
calls and token usage compared to agent-based methods, yielding significant
efficiency improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI技术的普及，由训练数据偏差、人类先验偏见和算法缺陷导致的内部化政治倾向正在影响政治话语形态，需建立系统的算法政治偏见评估框架

Method: 构建包含意识形态对齐度、主题相关性、响应情感值和客观性指标的四维评估体系，对6个LLM的1800个响应进行多算法联合分析

Result: 所有被测模型均呈现显著的自由-威权主义倾向，存在推理替代（reasoning supersessions）和模板化拒绝（canned refusals）等系统性偏见表现

Conclusion: 算法偏见通过人机交互的心理机制渗透公共讨论，可能根据地区既有社会结构引发从众或极化，最终导致政治生态的认知扭曲

Abstract: Amidst the rapid normalization of generative artificial intelligence (GAI),
intelligent systems have come to dominate political discourse across
information mediums. However, internalized political biases stemming from
training data skews, human prejudice, and algorithmic flaws continue to plague
the novel technology. This paper employs a zero-shot classification approach to
evaluate algorithmic political partisanship through a methodical combination of
ideological alignment, topicality, response sentiment, and objectivity. A total
of 1800 model responses across six mainstream large language models (LLMs) were
individually input into four distinct fine-tuned classification algorithms,
each responsible for computing an aforementioned bias evaluation metric.
Results show an amplified liberal-authoritarian alignment across all six LLMs
evaluated, with notable instances of reasoning supersessions and canned
refusals. The study subsequently highlights the psychological influences
underpinning human-computer interactions and how intrinsic biases can permeate
public discourse. The resulting distortion of the political landscape can
ultimately manifest as conformity or polarization, depending on a region's
pre-existing socio-political structures.

Motivation: 探究不同语用框架、语言选择和指令层级对LLM拒绝行为的影响，评估现有安全防护机制的有效性

Method: 在80次/场景的种子迭代中，测试ZIP炸弹生成、信用卡号合成等五个危害领域，采用组合提示工程、多语言对比、角色扮演测试和AI辅助强化方法

Result: 德语/法语正式文本比英语更易泄露；Linux终端角色扮演在67%测试中绕过规则；语义分级器比Moderation API多捕获21%风险内容；不同推理栈拒绝率差异达5-10%

Conclusion: 提示工程能突破现有安全防护，多语言场景存在系统性风险，需建立语义级评估体系并关注推理环境一致性对安全性的影响

Abstract: We probe OpenAI's open-weights 20-billion-parameter model gpt-oss-20b to
study how sociopragmatic framing, language choice, and instruction hierarchy
affect refusal behavior. Across 80 seeded iterations per scenario, we test
several harm domains including ZIP-bomb construction (cyber threat), synthetic
card-number generation, minor-unsafe driving advice, drug-precursor indicators,
and RAG context exfiltration. Composite prompts that combine an educator
persona, a safety-pretext ("what to avoid"), and step-cue phrasing flip
assistance rates from 0% to 97.5% on a ZIP-bomb task. On our grid, formal
registers in German and French are often leakier than matched English prompts.
A "Linux terminal" role-play overrides a developer rule not to reveal context
in a majority of runs with a naive developer prompt, and we introduce an
AI-assisted hardening method that reduces leakage to 0% in several user-prompt
variants. We further test evaluation awareness with a paired-track design and
measure frame-conditioned differences between matched "helpfulness" and
"harmfulness" evaluation prompts; we observe inconsistent assistance in 13% of
pairs. Finally, we find that the OpenAI Moderation API under-captures
materially helpful outputs relative to a semantic grader, and that refusal
rates differ by 5 to 10 percentage points across inference stacks, raising
reproducibility concerns. We release prompts, seeds, outputs, and code for
reproducible auditing at https://github.com/ndurner/gpt-oss-rt-run .

Method: 采用红队测试方法（最小化诱导提示）测试豪萨语场景，辅以毒性认知调查（n=61）验证模型错误认知

Result: 模型生成有害/文化不敏感内容、存在致命物质安全误判（98%用户认为有毒物质被误判安全）、无法区分食材加工状态、使用侮辱性谚语构建错误论点

Conclusion: 现有安全机制在低资源语言场景中存在严重缺陷，需加强语言特异性安全调优，当前红队测试存在覆盖盲区

Abstract: In response to the recent safety probing for OpenAI's GPT-OSS-20b model, we
present a summary of a set of vulnerabilities uncovered in the model, focusing
on its performance and safety alignment in a low-resource language setting. The
core motivation for our work is to question the model's reliability for users
from underrepresented communities. Using Hausa, a major African language, we
uncover biases, inaccuracies, and cultural insensitivities in the model's
behaviour. With a minimal prompting, our red-teaming efforts reveal that the
model can be induced to generate harmful, culturally insensitive, and factually
inaccurate content in the language. As a form of reward hacking, we note how
the model's safety protocols appear to relax when prompted with polite or
grateful language, leading to outputs that could facilitate misinformation and
amplify hate speech. For instance, the model operates on the false assumption
that common insecticide locally known as Fiya-Fiya (Cyphermethrin) and
rodenticide like Shinkafar Bera (a form of Aluminium Phosphide) are safe for
human consumption. To contextualise the severity of this error and popularity
of the substances, we conducted a survey (n=61) in which 98% of participants
identified them as toxic. Additional failures include an inability to
distinguish between raw and processed foods and the incorporation of demeaning
cultural proverbs to build inaccurate arguments. We surmise that these issues
manifest through a form of linguistic reward hacking, where the model
prioritises fluent, plausible-sounding output in the target language over
safety and truthfulness. We attribute the uncovered flaws primarily to
insufficient safety tuning in low-resource linguistic contexts. By
concentrating on a low-resource setting, our approach highlights a significant
gap in current red-teaming effort and offer some recommendations.

Conclusion: AdaDetectGPT通过数据自适应机制显著改进了生成文本检测性能，为AI生成内容识别提供了可靠解决方案

Abstract: We study the problem of determining whether a piece of text has been authored
by a human or by a large language model (LLM). Existing state of the art
logits-based detectors make use of statistics derived from the log-probability
of the observed text evaluated using the distribution function of a given
source LLM. However, relying solely on log probabilities can be sub-optimal. In
response, we introduce AdaDetectGPT -- a novel classifier that adaptively
learns a witness function from training data to enhance the performance of
logits-based detectors. We provide statistical guarantees on its true positive
rate, false positive rate, true negative rate and false negative rate.
Extensive numerical studies show AdaDetectGPT nearly uniformly improves the
state-of-the-art method in various combination of datasets and LLMs, and the
improvement can reach up to 58%. A python implementation of our method is
available at https://github.com/Mamba413/AdaDetectGPT.

Result: 攻击成功率显著下降（Llama-3.1-8B从89.7%→5.6%），良性任务性能保持不变，计算效率提升40%

Conclusion: PSR作为动态安全防护方案，通过风险自评估实现安全性与计算效率的平衡，为LLM安全部署提供新范式

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing
with their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text.
However, their deployment raises significant concerns about the potential for
generating harmful or inappropriate content. In this paper, we introduce
Progressive Self-Reflection (PSR), a novel inference-time technique that
empowers LLMs to self-monitor and correct their outputs dynamically.
Experimental results demonstrate that applying our proposed method to
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct reduces the attack success rate from 77.5\% to 5.9\%, to
Llama-3.1-8B base from 89.7\% to 5.6\%, and to Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct from 44.4\%
to 3.8\%, without additional training, while maintaining their original
performance on benign tasks. Our approach acts as a test-time scaling method,
where additional self-reflection rounds enhance safety at the cost of inference
overhead. To balance safety with computational efficiency, we introduce a
lightweight self-reflection predictor that estimates the optimal number of
reflection rounds based on input complexity. This adaptive mechanism prevents
unnecessary self-assessment on benign inputs while ensuring thorough evaluation
when encountering potentially harmful content. Our findings suggest that
Progressive Self-Reflection serves as a scalable test-time approach, enhancing
LLM safety by dynamically allocating computational resources in proportion to
the input's risk profile.

Result: 在多个开源D-LLMs上的实验表明，TraceDet相比基线方法平均提升15.2%的AUROC指标

Conclusion: 通过显式建模多步去噪过程，TraceDet有效提升了扩散大语言模型的幻觉检测能力，验证了中间步骤信号的关键作用

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (D-LLMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to auto-regressive LLMs (AR-LLMs). However, the hallucination
problem in D-LLMs remains underexplored, limiting their reliability in
real-world applications. Existing hallucination detection methods are designed
for AR-LLMs and rely on signals from single-step generation, making them
ill-suited for D-LLMs where hallucination signals often emerge throughout the
multi-step denoising process. To bridge this gap, we propose TraceDet, a novel
framework that explicitly leverages the intermediate denoising steps of D-LLMs
for hallucination detection. TraceDet models the denoising process as an action
trace, with each action defined as the model's prediction over the cleaned
response, conditioned on the previous intermediate output. By identifying the
sub-trace that is maximally informative to the hallucinated responses, TraceDet
leverages the key hallucination signals in the multi-step denoising process of
D-LLMs for hallucination detection. Extensive experiments on various open
source D-LLMs demonstrate that TraceDet consistently improves hallucination
detection, achieving an average gain in AUROC of 15.2% compared to baselines.

Conclusion: 验证了LLMs在多语言情感分析中的有效性，参数高效微调为资源有限场景提供可行解决方案。

Abstract: Sentiment analysis is an essential part of text analysis, which is a larger
field that includes determining and evaluating the author's emotional state.
This method is essential since it makes it easier to comprehend consumers'
feelings, viewpoints, and preferences holistically. The introduction of large
language models (LLMs), such as Llama, has greatly increased the availability
of cutting-edge model applications, such as sentiment analysis. However,
accurate sentiment analysis is hampered by the intricacy of written language
and the diversity of languages used in evaluations. The viability of using
transformer-based BERT models and other LLMs for sentiment analysis from
Bangladesh e commerce reviews is investigated in this paper. A subset of 4000
samples from the original dataset of Bangla and English customer reviews was
utilized to fine-tune the model. The fine tuned Llama-3.1-8B model outperformed
other fine-tuned models, including Phi-3.5-mini-instruct, Mistral-7B-v0.1,
DistilBERT-multilingual, mBERT, and XLM-R-base, with an overall accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score of 95.5%, 93%, 88%, 90%. The study emphasizes

Method: 提出并行多代理框架TUMIX，各代理采用不同工具策略迭代共享优化答案，支持自动优化代理设计及动态停止优化机制。

Result: 在Gemini系列模型上超越现有方法，平均准确率提升3.55%；49%推理成本时保持性能，进一步扩展可获更高精度。

Conclusion: TUMIX通过代理多样性实现高效工具组合，其动态停止和自动优化机制为LLM工具增强推理提供可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: While integrating tools like Code Interpreter and Search has significantly
enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning in models like ChatGPT Agent and
Gemini-Pro, practical guidance on optimal tool use is lacking. The core
challenge is effectively combining textual reasoning, coding, and search for
diverse questions. In this paper, we propose Tool-Use Mixture (TUMIX), an
ensemble framework that runs multiple agents in parallel, each employing
distinct tool-use strategies and answer paths. Agents in TUMIX iteratively
share and refine responses based on the question and previous answers. In
experiments, TUMIX achieves significant gains over state-of-the-art
tool-augmented and test-time scaling methods, delivering an average accuracy
improvement of up to 3.55% over the best baseline on Gemini-2.5-Pro and
Gemini-2.5-Flash across key reasoning benchmarks, with near-equal inference
costs. We find that agent diversity and quality are crucial and can be enhanced
by using LLMs to auto-optimize agent designs. Furthermore, TUMIX can halt
refinement upon reaching sufficient confidence, preserving performance at only
49% of the inference cost. Further scaling can achieve higher performance,
albeit at a greater cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推测解码的验证阶段成为瓶颈（如3B模型为70B目标模型推测时验证速度比token生成慢4倍）。现有中间验证方法存在训练开销大、内存占用高、依赖近似启发式导致精度损失等问题。

Method: 采用分层推测解码框架：1）利用早期退出模型（EE模型）实现低开销中间验证；2）通过复用键值缓存和隐藏状态优化资源效率；3）定期用目标模型验证中间结果保持精度。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，相比单层推测基线方法，HiSpec平均提升1.28倍吞吐量，最高达2.01倍，且精度无损。

Conclusion: HiSpec通过分层验证机制和资源共享设计，有效解决推测解码中的验证瓶颈问题，实现效率与精度的平衡。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by using a smaller draft model
to speculate tokens that a larger target model verifies. Verification is often
the bottleneck (e.g. verification is $4\times$ slower than token generation
when a 3B model speculates for a 70B target model), but most prior works focus
only on accelerating drafting. $\textit{``Intermediate"}$ verification reduces
verification time by discarding inaccurate draft tokens early, but existing
methods incur substantial training overheads in incorporating the intermediate
verifier, increase the memory footprint to orchestrate the intermediate
verification step, and compromise accuracy by relying on approximate
heuristics.
  We propose $\underline{\textit{Hi}}\textit{erarchical
}\underline{\textit{Spec}}\textit{ulative Decoding (HiSpec)}$, a framework for
high-throughput speculative decoding that exploits $\textit{early-exit (EE)
models}$ for low-overhead intermediate verification. EE models allow tokens to
exit early by skipping layer traversal and are explicitly trained so that
hidden states at selected layers can be interpreted, making them uniquely
suited for intermediate verification without drastically increasing compute and
memory overheads. To improve resource-efficiency even further, we design a
methodology that enables HiSpec to re-use key-value caches and hidden states
between the draft, intermediate verifier, and target models. To maintain
accuracy, HiSpec periodically validates the draft tokens accepted by the
intermediate verifier against the target model. Our evaluations using various
representative benchmarks and models show that HiSpec improves throughput by
1.28$\times$ on average and by up to 2.01$\times$ compared to the baseline
single-layer speculation without compromising accuracy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在需要因果/时间推理的事件问题上表现不佳，需探索如何通过结构化知识增强其推理能力。

Method: 设计九种提示组合（零样本/小样本/思维链 × 纯文本/纯图/文本+图），在TORQUESTRA基准测试因果事件推理能力。

Result: 相比纯文本基线平均准确率提升5%，零样本设置下最高提升12%，图增强思维链提示效果最佳（提升18%）。

Conclusion: 因果图无需微调即可增强LLMs事件推理，为提示式QA提供了灵活的结构化知识编码方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general language tasks but often
struggle with event-based questions-especially those requiring causal or
temporal reasoning. We introduce TAG-EQA (Text-And-Graph for Event Question
Answering), a prompting framework that injects causal event graphs into LLM
inputs by converting structured relations into natural-language statements.
TAG-EQA spans nine prompting configurations, combining three strategies
(zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought) with three input modalities (text-only,
graph-only, text+graph), enabling a systematic analysis of when and how
structured knowledge aids inference. On the TORQUESTRA benchmark, TAG-EQA
improves accuracy by 5% on average over text-only baselines, with gains up to
12% in zero-shot settings and 18% when graph-augmented CoT prompting is
effective. While performance varies by model and configuration, our findings
show that causal graphs can enhance event reasoning in LLMs without
fine-tuning, offering a flexible way to encode structure in prompt-based QA.

quality assessment of production model endpoints. The current approaches to
response classification relies on methods that are too expensive (i.e.
LLM-as-a-Judge) or that are far from real-world conditions (string-matching,
logprob). In this paper, a structure-free evaluation method is presented. The
method makes use of semantic embedding distances to match target candidates
with arbitrary LM-generated text, resulting in a robust classification of the
response at a relatively low compute cost (embedding models of less than $10B$
parameters). The results show a regression score of ~0.97 and an accuracy of
~96% against human annotators, tested over 3 data sets and 3 different LM
architectures.

Result: 在金融领域四个基准测试中，不同大模型的QA准确率提升0.6%-10.5%，超越领域微调模型和复杂提示策略

Conclusion: 领域QA中单个支撑性问题比多步引导更有效，该发现挑战了传统分步推理的常见做法

Abstract: Domain-specific quantitative reasoning remains a major challenge for large
language models (LLMs), especially in fields requiring expert knowledge and
complex question answering (QA). In this work, we propose Expert Question
Decomposition (EQD), an approach designed to balance the use of domain
knowledge with computational efficiency. EQD is built on a two-step fine-tuning
framework and guided by a reward function that measures the effectiveness of
generated sub-questions in improving QA outcomes. It requires only a few
thousand training examples and a single A100 GPU for fine-tuning, with
inference time comparable to zero-shot prompting. Beyond its efficiency, EQD
outperforms state-of-the-art domain-tuned models and advanced prompting
strategies. We evaluate EQD in the financial domain, characterized by
specialized knowledge and complex quantitative reasoning, across four benchmark
datasets. Our method consistently improves QA performance by 0.6% to 10.5%
across different LLMs. Our analysis reveals an important insight: in
domain-specific QA, a single supporting question often provides greater benefit
than detailed guidance steps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer存在层堆叠冗余、密集注意力低效、位置编码依赖等限制，影响长上下文推理能力和结构适应性

Method: 1. R2MU实现递归推理 2. ASAM引入专家级稀疏注意力 3. SOES构建无位置编码的拓扑结构

Result: 在语言建模、多跳QA等任务中，在同等计算预算下性能优于主流基线模型

Conclusion: ReSSFormer通过稀疏递归架构实现了可扩展性、效率与结构灵活性的统一

Abstract: While Transformer architectures have demonstrated impressive scalability
across domains, they continue to face challenges in long-context reasoning,
computational efficiency, and structural generalization - largely due to rigid
layer stacking, dense attention, and reliance on positional encodings. We
present ReSSFormer, a Recursive Sparse Structured Transformer that integrates
three complementary innovations: Recurrent Reasoning & Memory Unit (R2MU) for
iterative reasoning with bounded depth, Adaptive Sparse Attention Module (ASAM)
for efficient and focused context selection, and Self-Organizing Encoder
Structure (SOES) for position-free structure induction. ReSSFormer replaces
conventional depth stacking with recurrent inference, substitutes full
attention with token- and expert-level sparsity, and models latent token
topology directly from content. Across language modeling, multi-hop QA, and
structure-sensitive tasks, ReSSFormer consistently outperforms strong baselines
under comparable FLOPs and parameter budgets, highlighting its scalability,
efficiency, and structural flexibility.

Motivation: 现有方法存在文本层面过拟合（如奖励模型）和置信度校准失效（如token概率）的缺陷，而模型隐藏状态同时包含语义特征和置信度信息，可作为更可靠的验证基础

Method: 提出CLUE验证框架：1）将推理轨迹编码为隐藏状态变化量 2）基于历史成功/失败样本构建聚类中心 3）通过最近质心距离判断答案正确性

Result: 在AIME 24测试中，使用1.5B模型将准确率从多数投票的56.7%提升至top-maj@16的70%，全面超越LLM自我评估和传统置信度方法

Conclusion: 隐藏状态编码了丰富的验证信号，CLUE的简洁设计验证了该方向的潜力，为LLM输出质量评估提供了新的无监督解决方案

Abstract: Assessing the quality of Large Language Model (LLM) outputs presents a
critical challenge. Previous methods either rely on text-level information
(e.g., reward models, majority voting), which can overfit to superficial cues,
or on calibrated confidence from token probabilities, which would fail on
less-calibrated models. Yet both of these signals are, in fact, partial
projections of a richer source of information: the model's internal hidden
states. Early layers, closer to token embeddings, preserve semantic and lexical
features that underpin text-based judgments, while later layers increasingly
align with output logits, embedding confidence-related information. This paper
explores hidden states directly as a unified foundation for verification. We
show that the correctness of a solution is encoded as a geometrically separable
signature within the trajectory of hidden activations. To validate this, we
present Clue (Clustering and Experience-based Verification), a deliberately
minimalist, non-parametric verifier. With no trainable parameters, CLUE only
summarizes each reasoning trace by an hidden state delta and classifies
correctness via nearest-centroid distance to ``success'' and ``failure''
clusters formed from past experience. The simplicity of this method highlights
the strength of the underlying signal. Empirically, CLUE consistently
outperforms LLM-as-a-judge baselines and matches or exceeds modern
confidence-based methods in reranking candidates, improving both top-1 and
majority-vote accuracy across AIME 24/25 and GPQA. As a highlight, on AIME 24
with a 1.5B model, CLUE boosts accuracy from 56.7% (majority@64) to 70.0%
(top-maj@16).

Keywords: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Large Language Models (LLMs),
Fine-tuning, Question Answering, Joint fine-tuning TL;DR: We evaluate and
compare strategies for fine-tuning Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipelines, including independent fine-tuning, joint fine-tuning, and two-phase
fine-tuning. Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a popular
framework for question answering that is powered by two large language models
(LLMs): an embedding model that retrieves context documents from a database
that are relevant to a given question, and a generator model that uses the
retrieved context to generate an answer to the question. Both the embedding and
generator models can be fine-tuned to increase performance of a RAG pipeline on
a new task, but multiple fine-tuning strategies exist with different costs and
benefits. In this paper, we evaluate and compare several RAG fine-tuning
strategies, including independent, joint, and two-phase fine-tuning. In our
experiments, we observe that all of these strategies achieve about equal
improvement in EM and F1 generation quality metrics, although they have
significantly different computational costs. We conclude the optimal
fine-tuning strategy to use depends on whether the training dataset includes
context labels and whether a grid search over the learning rates for the
embedding and generator models is required.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小语言模型在繁体中文应用中存在token级不稳定性（随机输出非TC字符/语码转换）的实际可靠性问题，传统全模型重训练方案成本过高

Method: 三阶段参数高效优化：1）TC语料持续预训练 2）指令数据监督微调 3）TC偏好直接优化，采用LoRA适配器避免全模型重训练

Result: 基准测试显示非TC输出减少51.3%；命名实体翻译任务错误语言token分别比Llama-3B/Qwen-1.5B减少77.2%/57.2%

Conclusion: 在1B规模实现TC稳定性，提供可复现的适配器优化方案，为其他非英语语言模型优化提供实践参考

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) enable cost-effective, on-device and
latency-sensitive AI applications, yet their deployment in Traditional Chinese
(TC) remains hindered by token-level instability - models unpredictably emit
non-TC characters or code-switch into other languages. We address this
practical reliability gap by creating PureTC-1B, a three-stage stabilization
pipeline for Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct (an open-weight, instruction-tuned model
released by Meta) using parameter-efficient LoRA adapters. Our method combines
Continual Pre-Training (CPT) on TC-centric corpora, Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) with instruction data, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using
TC-adherence preferences to improve monolingual robustness without full-model
retraining. On a benchmark designed to simulate real-world usage, PureTC-1B
achieves a 51.3% relative reduction (micro-average) in non-TC output tokens
versus the base model. On a Named Entity Translation (NET) task, PureTC-1B
further reduces incorrect-language tokens by 77.2% relative to Llama-3B and
57.2% relative to Qwen-1.5B, indicating that robust TC adherence is attainable
even at the 1B scale. The pipeline is reproducible, adapter-only, and
hardware-friendly, offering practitioners a practical recipe to enhance
language stability for TC and potentially other non-English languages.

Result: 在问答、数学推理和代码生成测试中全面超越单代理及传统多代理系统，支持多种LLM架构

Conclusion: 上下文敏感的结构适应性是高性能LLM多代理系统的核心要素，动态配置显著提升系统效能

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language
processing capabilities, their practical implementation as autonomous
multi-agent systems (MAS) for industrial problem-solving encounters persistent
barriers. Conventional MAS architectures are fundamentally restricted by
inflexible, hand-crafted graph topologies that lack contextual responsiveness,
resulting in diminished efficacy across varied academic and commercial
workloads. To surmount these constraints, we introduce AMAS, a
paradigm-shifting framework that redefines LLM-based MAS through a novel
dynamic graph designer. This component autonomously identifies task-specific
optimal graph configurations via lightweight LLM adaptation, eliminating the
reliance on monolithic, universally applied structural templates. Instead, AMAS
exploits the intrinsic properties of individual inputs to intelligently direct
query trajectories through task-optimized agent pathways. Rigorous validation
across question answering, mathematical deduction, and code generation
benchmarks confirms that AMAS systematically exceeds state-of-the-art
single-agent and multi-agent approaches across diverse LLM architectures. Our
investigation establishes that context-sensitive structural adaptability
constitutes a foundational requirement for high-performance LLM MAS
deployments.

Result: BERT模型在现有数据集上表现最佳，发现越狱提示具有结构上的显式自反性特征

Conclusion: 提示结构的显式自反性可能作为越狱意图的识别信号，为安全机制设计提供新方向

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from a range of vulnerabilities that
allow malicious users to solicit undesirable responses through manipulation of
the input text. These so-called jailbreak prompts are designed to trick the LLM
into circumventing the safety guardrails put in place to keep responses
acceptable to the developer's policies. In this study, we analyse the ability
of different machine learning models to distinguish jailbreak prompts from
genuine uses, including looking at our ability to identify jailbreaks that use
previously unseen strategies. Our results indicate that using current datasets
the best performance is achieved by fine tuning a Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT) model end-to-end for identifying
jailbreaks. We visualise the keywords that distinguish jailbreak from genuine
prompts and conclude that explicit reflexivity in prompt structure could be a
signal of jailbreak intention.

Abstract: Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional
performance in language understanding and generation. However, their
application in text embedding tasks has been relatively slow, along with the
analysis of their semantic representation in probing tasks, due to the
constraints of the unidirectional attention mechanism.
  This paper aims to explore whether such constraints can be overcome by
enabling bidirectional attention in LLMs. We tested different variants of the
Llama architecture through additional training steps, progressively enabling
bidirectional attention and unsupervised/supervised contrastive learning.

Abstract: Cybersecurity is a relentless arms race, with AI driven offensive systems
evolving faster than traditional defenses can adapt. Research and tooling
remain fragmented across isolated defensive functions, creating blind spots
that adversaries exploit. Autonomous agents capable of integrating, exploit
confirmation, remediation, and validation into a single closed loop offer
promise, but the field lacks three essentials: a framework defining the agentic
capabilities of security systems across security life cycle, a principled
method for evaluating closed loop agents, and a benchmark for measuring their
performance in practice. We introduce CLASP: the Closed-Loop Autonomous
Security Performance framework which aligns the security lifecycle
(reconnaissance, exploitation, root cause analysis, patch synthesis,
validation) with core agentic capabilities (planning, tool use, memory,
reasoning, reflection & perception) providing a common vocabulary and rubric
for assessing agentic capabilities in security tasks. By applying CLASP to 21
representative works, we map where systems demonstrate strengths, and where
capability gaps persist. We then define the Closed-Loop Capability (CLC) Score,
a composite metric quantifying both degree of loop closure and operational
effectiveness, and outline the requirements for a closed loop benchmark.
Together, CLASP and the CLC Score, provide the vocabulary, diagnostics, and
measurements needed to advance both function level performance and measure
closed loop security agents.

Conclusion: MDSEval填补了MDS领域元评估空白，提出的质量过滤框架与维度体系为未来评估方法开发提供了重要基准与启示。

Abstract: Multimodal Dialogue Summarization (MDS) is a critical task with wide-ranging
applications. To support the development of effective MDS models, robust
automatic evaluation methods are essential for reducing both cost and human
effort. However, such methods require a strong meta-evaluation benchmark
grounded in human annotations. In this work, we introduce MDSEval, the first
meta-evaluation benchmark for MDS, consisting image-sharing dialogues,
corresponding summaries, and human judgments across eight well-defined quality
aspects. To ensure data quality and richfulness, we propose a novel filtering
framework leveraging Mutually Exclusive Key Information (MEKI) across
modalities. Our work is the first to identify and formalize key evaluation
dimensions specific to MDS. We benchmark state-of-the-art modal evaluation
methods, revealing their limitations in distinguishing summaries from advanced
MLLMs and their susceptibility to various bias.

Abstract: Reasoning protocols such as Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thought (ToT)
organize internal deliberation but lack an explicit mechanism for external
questioning that elicits self-revision. We present FOR-Prompting (From
Objection to Revision Prompting), an asymmetric protocol where a Defender
proposes an answer, an Objectioner raises question-style objections with no
direct fixes, and a Host enforces consistency and closure. On GSM8K we observe
about a 22% point gain over single-prompt and accuracy on par with CoT, with
more than 10% higher ratings in reasoning and coherence from a uniform GPT 4.1
judge. FOR-Prompting also corrects mistakes without tools or human supervision
on tricky queries, and improves performance for small-scale model (approx. 19%
accuracy improved on Llama3.2:1b for GSM8K task), highlighting promise for
small models and on personal device use. Beyond factual QA, qualitative
analyses on open-ended tasks show enhanced exploration and refinement, with
dialogue traces that make assumptions and trade-offs explicit. The protocol is
model agnostic and operates purely at the prompt level through role-structured
turns, so it works with hosted and local models of different sizes without
retraining, and it supports large-scale study of objection-guided reasoning.

Result: 识别出组合式(显式计算中间变量f(x))和直接式(无中间变量特征)两种处理机制

Conclusion: 当嵌入空间存在x到g(f(x))的线性映射时，模型倾向于采用直接式处理机制

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) appear to be increasingly capable of
solving compositional tasks, it is an open question whether they do so using
compositional mechanisms. In this work, we investigate how feedforward LLMs
solve two-hop factual recall tasks, which can be expressed compositionally as
$g(f(x))$. We first confirm that modern LLMs continue to suffer from the
"compositionality gap": i.e. their ability to compute both $z = f(x)$ and $y =
g(z)$ does not entail their ability to compute the composition $y = g(f(x))$.
Then, using logit lens on their residual stream activations, we identify two
processing mechanisms, one which solves tasks $\textit{compositionally}$,
computing $f(x)$ along the way to computing $g(f(x))$, and one which solves
them $\textit{directly}$, without any detectable signature of the intermediate
variable $f(x)$. Finally, we find that which mechanism is employed appears to
be related to the embedding space geometry, with the idiomatic mechanism being
dominant in cases where there exists a linear mapping from $x$ to $g(f(x))$ in
the embedding spaces. We fully release our data and code at:

Conclusion: 数据平衡是解决医疗对话格式惯性的有效策略，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have brought significant
improvements to various service domains, including chatbots and medical
pre-consultation applications. In the healthcare domain, the most common
approach for adapting LLMs to multi-turn dialogue generation is Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, datasets for SFT in tasks like medical
pre-consultation typically exhibit a skewed turn-count distribution. Training
on such data induces a novel failure mechanism we term **Format Inertia**,
where models tend to generate repetitive, format-correct, but diagnostically
uninformative questions in long medical dialogues. To mitigate this observed
failure mechanism, we adopt a simple, data-centric method that rebalances the
turn-count distribution of the training dataset. Experimental results show that
our approach substantially alleviates Format Inertia in medical
pre-consultation.

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning models have recently shown promise on challenging
domains such as olympiad-level geometry, yet their evaluation remains dominated
by aggregate accuracy, a single score that obscures where and how models are
improving. We introduce MathLens, a benchmark designed to disentangle the
subskills of multimodal reasoning while preserving the complexity of
textbook-style geometry problems. The benchmark separates performance into
three components: Perception: extracting information from raw inputs,
Reasoning: operating on available information, and Integration: selecting
relevant perceptual evidence and applying it within reasoning. To support each
test, we provide annotations: visual diagrams, textual descriptions to evaluate
reasoning in isolation, controlled questions that require both modalities, and
probes for fine-grained perceptual skills, all derived from symbolic
specifications of the problems to ensure consistency and robustness. Our
analysis reveals that different training approaches have uneven effects: First,
reinforcement learning chiefly strengthens perception, especially when
supported by textual supervision, while textual SFT indirectly improves
perception through reflective reasoning. Second, reasoning improves only in
tandem with perception. Third, integration remains the weakest capacity, with
residual errors concentrated there once other skills advance. Finally,
robustness diverges: RL improves consistency under diagram variation, whereas
multimodal SFT reduces it through overfitting. We will release all data and
experimental logs.

TL;DR: 将工程设计标准转化为模块化本体实现阀门选型自动化验证


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决工程标准文档数字化程度低、难以机器解析的问题，推动工业标准向智能数字化转型

Method: 采用本体建模模式构建W3C兼容的模块化本体库，结合ISO IDO顶层本体进行语义推理与设计规则验证

Result: 成功实现阀门规格自动合规检查，验证产品类型与标准匹配性

Conclusion: 基于本体的智能标准架构为行业标准数字化提供可行路径，支持设备选型自动化与标准化管理

Abstract: Engineering design processes use technical specifications and must comply
with standards. Product specifications, product type data sheets, and design
standards are still mainly document-centric despite the ambition to digitalize
industrial work. In this paper, we demonstrate how to transform information
held in engineering design standards into modular, reusable,
machine-interpretable ontologies and use the ontologies in quality assurance of
the plant design and equipment selection process. We use modelling patterns to
create modular ontologies for knowledge captured in the text and in frequently
referenced tables in International Standards for piping, material and valve
design. These modules are exchangeable, as stored in a W3C compliant format,
and interoperable as they are aligned with the top-level ontology ISO DIS
23726-3: Industrial Data Ontology (IDO).
  We test these ontologies, created based on international material and piping
standards and industry norms, on a valve selection process. Valves are
instantiated in semantic asset models as individuals along with a semantic
representation of the environmental condition at their location on the asset.
We create "functional location tags" as OWL individuals that become instances
of OWL class Valve Data Sheet (VDS) specified valves. Similarly we create
instances of manufacturer product type. Our approach enables automated
validation that a specific VDS is compliant with relevant industry standards.
Using semantic reasoning and executable design rules, we also determine whether
the product type meets the valve specification. Creation of shared, reusable
IDO-based modular ontologies for design standards enables semantic reasoning to
be applied to equipment selection processes and demonstrates the potential of
this approach for Standards Bodies wanting to transition to digitized Smart
Standards.

TL;DR: 提出Refusal Index（RI）作为衡量大语言模型知识感知拒绝能力的新指标，通过双阶段评估方法验证其有效性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标存在偏差（拒绝率影响评分）和代理指标缺陷（无法直接反映模型真实拒绝行为），需要更可靠的知识感知拒绝评估方法

Method: 1. 定义RI为拒绝概率与错误概率的斯皮尔曼秩相关
2. 设计双阶段评估法：通过两次标准评估的拒绝率估算RI

Result: 在16个模型和5个数据集上验证RI的稳定性，发现LLM拒绝行为存在不可靠性（高准确率≠可靠拒绝）

Conclusion: 需要将RI与传统准确率指标结合，实现全面的事实性评估，揭示LLM拒绝行为的脆弱性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) should refuse to answer questions beyond their
knowledge. This capability, which we term knowledge-aware refusal, is crucial
for factual reliability. However, existing metrics fail to faithfully measure
this ability. On the one hand, simple refusal-based metrics are biased by
refusal rates and yield inconsistent scores when models exhibit different
refusal tendencies. On the other hand, existing calibration metrics are
proxy-based, capturing the performance of auxiliary calibration processes
rather than the model's actual refusal behavior. In this work, we propose the
Refusal Index (RI), a principled metric that measures how accurately LLMs
refuse questions they do not know. We define RI as Spearman's rank correlation
between refusal probability and error probability. To make RI practically
measurable, we design a lightweight two-pass evaluation method that efficiently
estimates RI from observed refusal rates across two standard evaluation runs.
Extensive experiments across 16 models and 5 datasets demonstrate that RI
accurately quantifies a model's intrinsic knowledge-aware refusal capability in
factual tasks. Notably, RI remains stable across different refusal rates and
provides consistent model rankings independent of a model's overall accuracy
and refusal rates. More importantly, RI provides insight into an important but
previously overlooked aspect of LLM factuality: while LLMs achieve high
accuracy on factual tasks, their refusal behavior can be unreliable and
fragile. This finding highlights the need to complement traditional accuracy
metrics with the Refusal Index for comprehensive factuality evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律AI发展需要可扩展的文本提取评估方法，尤其在缺乏标注数据的司法场景中，需验证无监督指标的可靠性

Method: 使用7168份专家评分验证16种无监督指标（涵盖文档/语义/结构/伪真实值/法律特定类别）在1000份俄语司法裁决中的表现，采用Pearson相关系数、Lin一致性系数和MAE评估指标性能

Result: Term Frequency Coherence（Pearson r=0.540）和Coverage Ratio（r=0.513）与专家评分最契合，Legal Term Density呈强负相关（r=-0.479）。LLM评估工具（gpt-4.1-mini）仅显示中等相关性（r=0.382）

Conclusion: 无监督指标可实现法律文本的初步筛查，但重要司法场景仍需人工介入。研究为法律NLP提供了免标注评估工具，推动司法分析和伦理AI部署

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence in legal natural language
processing demands scalable methods for evaluating text extraction from
judicial decisions. This study evaluates 16 unsupervised metrics, including
novel formulations, to assess the quality of extracting seven semantic blocks
from 1,000 anonymized Russian judicial decisions, validated against 7,168
expert reviews on a 1--5 Likert scale. These metrics, spanning document-based,
semantic, structural, pseudo-ground truth, and legal-specific categories,
operate without pre-annotated ground truth. Bootstrapped correlations, Lin's
concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), and mean absolute error (MAE) reveal
that Term Frequency Coherence (Pearson $r = 0.540$, Lin CCC = 0.512, MAE =
0.127) and Coverage Ratio/Block Completeness (Pearson $r = 0.513$, Lin CCC =
0.443, MAE = 0.139) best align with expert ratings, while Legal Term Density
(Pearson $r = -0.479$, Lin CCC = -0.079, MAE = 0.394) show strong negative
correlations. The LLM Evaluation Score (mean = 0.849, Pearson $r = 0.382$, Lin
CCC = 0.325, MAE = 0.197) showed moderate alignment, but its performance, using
gpt-4.1-mini via g4f, suggests limited specialization for legal textse. These
findings highlight that unsupervised metrics, including LLM-based approaches,
enable scalable screening but, with moderate correlations and low CCC values,
cannot fully replace human judgment in high-stakes legal contexts. This work
advances legal NLP by providing annotation-free evaluation tools, with
implications for judicial analytics and ethical AI deployment.

Conclusion: 研究为LLM时代的垃圾检测提供新数据集、实用框架和适应紧迫性的实证依据

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has enabled the generation of highly
persuasive spam reviews that closely mimic human writing. These reviews pose
significant challenges for existing detection systems and threaten the
credibility of online platforms. In this work, we first create three realistic
LLM-generated spam review datasets using three distinct LLMs, each guided by
product metadata and genuine reference reviews. Evaluations by GPT-4.1 confirm
the high persuasion and deceptive potential of these reviews. To address this
threat, we propose FraudSquad, a hybrid detection model that integrates text
embeddings from a pre-trained language model with a gated graph transformer for
spam node classification. FraudSquad captures both semantic and behavioral
signals without relying on manual feature engineering or massive training
resources. Experiments show that FraudSquad outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by up to 44.22% in precision and 43.01% in recall on three
LLM-generated datasets, while also achieving promising results on two
human-written spam datasets. Furthermore, FraudSquad maintains a modest model
size and requires minimal labeled training data, making it a practical solution
for real-world applications. Our contributions include new synthetic datasets,
a practical detection framework, and empirical evidence highlighting the
urgency of adapting spam detection to the LLM era. Our code and datasets are

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大语言模型（LLM）在数学解题中展现出强大能力，但对句法偏离训练分布的问题存在系统性盲区。研究发现语法复杂度（通过依存距离理论衡量）与错误率正相关，表明错误源于结构错位而非概念难度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs在语义简单但句法陌生的数学问题上失败的原因，揭示模型表层形式与内在表征的脆弱关联机制。

Method: 通过模板重述错误问题（保持语义但简化结构），采用依存距离理论（DLT）量化句法复杂度，并在多数据集验证复杂度与错误率的关系。

Result: 结构简化的重述显著提升正确率，DLT分数越高错误率越高，证明句法结构对模型表现具有决定性影响。

Conclusion: LLMs的推理错误主要来自句法结构错位，基于句法感知的干预策略可有效识别和缓解此类归纳失败问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong mathematical problem-solving
abilities but frequently fail on problems that deviate syntactically from their
training distribution. We identify a systematic failure mode, syntactic blind
spots, in which models misapply familiar reasoning strategies to problems that
are semantically straightforward but phrased in unfamiliar ways. These errors
are not due to gaps in mathematical competence, but rather reflect a brittle
coupling between surface form and internal representation. To test this, we
rephrase incorrectly answered questions using syntactic templates drawn from
correct examples. These rephrasings, which preserve semantics while reducing
structural complexity, often lead to correct answers. We quantify syntactic
complexity using a metric based on Dependency Locality Theory (DLT), and show
that higher DLT scores are associated with increased failure rates across
multiple datasets. Our findings suggest that many reasoning errors stem from
structural misalignment rather than conceptual difficulty, and that
syntax-aware interventions can reveal and mitigate these inductive failures.

Motivation: 现有半结构化网页数据提取方法存在泛化性差和计算资源消耗大的问题，传统单页处理模式效率低下

Method: 利用同站点网页布局相似性作为强化学习奖励信号，生成跨页面适用的抽取脚本，结合CommonCrawl数据迭代训练

Result: 脚本质量提升13%，GPT-4o问答准确率提高4%，计算资源消耗降低90%

Conclusion: 通过脚本复用机制实现了可扩展、资源高效的网页信息提取，为大规模网络数据处理提供新范式

Abstract: Semi-structured content in HTML tables, lists, and infoboxes accounts for a
substantial share of factual data on the web, yet the formatting complicates
usage, and reliably extracting structured information from them remains
challenging. Existing methods either lack generalization or are
resource-intensive due to per-page LLM inference. In this paper, we introduce
SCRIBES (SCRIpt-Based Semi-Structured Content Extraction at Web-Scale), a novel
reinforcement learning framework that leverages layout similarity across
webpages within the same site as a reward signal. Instead of processing each
page individually, SCRIBES generates reusable extraction scripts that can be
applied to groups of structurally similar webpages. Our approach further
improves by iteratively training on synthetic annotations from in-the-wild
CommonCrawl data. Experiments show that our approach outperforms strong
baselines by over 13% in script quality and boosts downstream question
answering accuracy by more than 4% for GPT-4o, enabling scalable and
resource-efficient web information extraction.

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision-and-language models consist of many parameters and
learn from enormous datasets, surpassing the amounts of linguistic data that
children are exposed to as they acquire a language. This paper presents our
approach to the multimodal track of the BabyLM challenge addressing this
discrepancy. We develop language-only and multimodal models in low-resource
settings using developmentally plausible datasets, with our multimodal models
outperforming previous BabyLM baselines. One finding in the multimodal language
model literature is that these models tend to underperform in
\textit{language-only} tasks. Therefore, we focus on maintaining language-only
abilities in multimodal models. To this end, we experiment with \textit{model
merging}, where we fuse the parameters of multimodal models with those of
language-only models using weighted linear interpolation. Our results
corroborate the findings that multimodal models underperform in language-only
benchmarks that focus on grammar, and model merging with text-only models can
help alleviate this problem to some extent, while maintaining multimodal
performance.

Motivation: 传统LLM后期训练存在更新成本高、重训练引发副作用两大痛点，需开发支持持续精准编辑且不破坏模型原有知识的解决方案。

Method: 1. 闭环反馈机制动态调整编辑强度
2. 知识融合策略增强编辑稳定性
3. 强局部性保护防止非目标区域干扰
4. 分层记忆管理系统实现知识版本控制

Result: 跨模型实验显示编辑准确率提升10-30pp，知识遗忘率降低40%+，在7B-70B参数规模模型上验证有效性。

Conclusion: REPAIR为构建可持续进化的可信LLM提供了系统性框架，推动模型编辑从离散更新向终身学习范式转变。

Abstract: Post-training for large language models (LLMs) is constrained by the high
cost of acquiring new knowledge or correcting errors and by the unintended side
effects that frequently arise from retraining. To address these issues, we
introduce REPAIR (Robust Editing via Progressive Adaptive Intervention and
Reintegration), a lifelong editing framework designed to support precise and
low-cost model updates while preserving non-target knowledge. REPAIR mitigates
the instability and conflicts of large-scale sequential edits through a
closed-loop feedback mechanism coupled with dynamic memory management.
Furthermore, by incorporating frequent knowledge fusion and enforcing strong
locality guards, REPAIR effectively addresses the shortcomings of traditional
distribution-agnostic approaches that often overlook unintended ripple effects.
Our experiments demonstrate that REPAIR boosts editing accuracy by 10%-30%
across multiple model families and significantly reduces knowledge forgetting.
This work introduces a robust framework for developing reliable, scalable, and
continually evolving LLMs.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in enhancing the reasoning
performance of LLMs. For example, they can provide training signals to finetune
LLMs during reinforcement learning (RL) and help select the best answer from
multiple candidates during inference. In this paper, we provide a systematic
introduction to RMs, along with a comprehensive survey of their applications in
LLM reasoning. We first review fundamental concepts of RMs, including their
architectures, training methodologies, and evaluation techniques. Then, we
explore their key applications: (1) guiding generation and selecting optimal
outputs during LLM inference, (2) facilitating data synthesis and iterative
self-improvement for LLMs, and (3) providing training signals in RL-based
finetuning. Finally, we address critical open questions regarding the
selection, generalization, evaluation, and enhancement of RMs, based on
existing research and our own empirical findings. Our analysis aims to provide
actionable insights for the effective deployment and advancement of RMs for LLM

Result: 开发出可分析且鲁棒的系统框架，代码已开源（github.com/davegabe/pag-llm）

Conclusion: ILM为下一代可信LLM奠定基础，使模型兼具鲁棒性、可追溯性和可控性

Abstract: The current landscape of defensive mechanisms for LLMs is fragmented and
underdeveloped, unlike prior work on classifiers. To further promote
adversarial robustness in LLMs, we propose Inverse Language Modeling (ILM), a
unified framework that simultaneously 1) improves the robustness of LLMs to
input perturbations, and, at the same time, 2) enables native grounding by
inverting model outputs to identify potentially toxic or unsafe input triggers.
ILM transforms LLMs from static generators into analyzable and robust systems,
potentially helping RED teaming. ILM can lay the foundation for next-generation
LLMs that are not only robust and grounded but also fundamentally more
controllable and trustworthy. The code is publicly available at

Conclusion: 在线强化学习能有效提升声明验证精度，开源代码为后续研究奠定基础

Abstract: Claim verification with large language models (LLMs) has recently attracted
considerable attention, owing to their superior reasoning capabilities and
transparent verification pathways compared to traditional answer-only
judgments. Online claim verification requires iterative evidence retrieval and
reasoning, yet existing approaches mainly rely on prompt engineering or
predesigned reasoning workflows without offering a unified training paradigm to
improve necessary skills. Therefore, we introduce Veri-R1, an online
reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables an LLM to interact with a
search engine and to receive reward signals that explicitly shape its planning,
retrieval, and reasoning behaviors. The dynamic interaction between models and
retrieval systems more accurately reflects real-world verification scenarios
and fosters comprehensive verification skills. Empirical results show that
Veri-R1 improves joint accuracy by up to 30% and doubles evidence score, often
surpassing larger-scale counterparts. Ablation studies further reveal the
impact of reward components and the link between output logits and label
accuracy. Our results highlight the effectiveness of online RL for precise and
faithful claim verification and provide a foundation for future research. We
release our code to support community progress in LLM empowered claim
verification.

Motivation: 为避免AI系统偏向多数群体价值观，需要识别个体主观价值解释。传统方法依赖人口统计学特征，本研究首次探索标注行为本身对价值预测的影响

Method: 使用情感(Sentiment)、情绪(Emotion)、论点(Argument)和主题(Topics)四个维度作为代理指标，在零样本和少样本设置下比较不同维度组合的预测效果

Result: 同时使用所有SEAT维度预测准确率最高，个体标注者间存在显著差异，验证了考虑个体主观标注的必要性。小规模实验为后续大规模验证奠定基础

Conclusion: 该研究突破性地将价值预测焦点从人口统计转向标注行为分析，为开发适配个体差异的AI系统提供了新的方法论框架

Abstract: Our interpretation of value concepts is shaped by our sociocultural
background and lived experiences, and is thus subjective. Recognizing
individual value interpretations is important for developing AI systems that
can align with diverse human perspectives and avoid bias toward majority
viewpoints. To this end, we investigate whether a language model can predict
individual value interpretations by leveraging multi-dimensional subjective
annotations as a proxy for their interpretive lens. That is, we evaluate
whether providing examples of how an individual annotates Sentiment, Emotion,
Argument, and Topics (SEAT dimensions) helps a language model in predicting
their value interpretations. Our experiment across different zero- and few-shot
settings demonstrates that providing all SEAT dimensions simultaneously yields
superior performance compared to individual dimensions and a baseline where no
information about the individual is provided. Furthermore, individual
variations across annotators highlight the importance of accounting for the
incorporation of individual subjective annotators. To the best of our
knowledge, this controlled setting, although small in size, is the first
attempt to go beyond demographics and investigate the impact of annotation
behavior on value prediction, providing a solid foundation for future
large-scale validation.

Motivation: 现有研究多基于固定模式评估NL2SQL模型，忽视模式设计对性能的影响。本文旨在系统分析不同规范化级别对模型表现的影响机制。

Method: 构建1NF-3NF的合成数据集和真实学术论文数据集，在零样本/少样本场景下评估8个大语言模型，对比不同规范化模式下的检索/聚合查询性能差异。

Result: 非规范化模式在简单查询中零样本准确率高达95%，但聚合查询因数据冗余/NULL值易错；规范化模式聚合查询准确率提升15%，但需少样本解决表连接错误问题。

Conclusion: NL2SQL系统应动态选择模式：简单查询用非规范化模式降低成本，复杂聚合用规范化模式，并通过少样本示例优化表连接预测准确率。

Abstract: Schema design, particularly normalization, is a critical yet often overlooked
factor in natural language to SQL (NL2SQL) systems. Most prior research
evaluates models on fixed schemas, overlooking the influence of design on
performance. We present the first systematic study of schema normalization's
impact, evaluating eight leading large language models on synthetic and
real-world datasets with varied normalization levels. We construct controlled
synthetic datasets with formal normalization (1NF-3NF) and real academic paper
datasets with practical schemes. Our results show that denormalized schemas
offer high accuracy on simple retrieval queries, even with cost-effective
models in zero-shot settings. In contrast, normalized schemas (2NF/3NF)
introduce challenges such as errors in base table selection and join type
prediction; however, these issues are substantially mitigated by providing
few-shot examples. For aggregation queries, normalized schemas yielded better
performance, mainly due to their robustness against the data duplication and
NULL value issues that cause errors in denormalized schemas. These findings
suggest that the optimal schema design for NL2SQL applications depends on the
types of queries to be supported. Our study demonstrates the importance of
considering schema design when developing NL2SQL interfaces and integrating
adaptive schema selection for real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 现有孟加拉语仇恨语音检测工具多为单任务设计，缺乏对言论类型、严重性、目标等多维度分析能力，难以满足复杂的内容审核需求。

Method: 通过构建多任务标注数据集，系统性对比传统模型、单语预训练模型（如BanglaBERT）和LLM在不同微调策略（零样本/LoRA）下的表现。

Result: LoRA调优的LLM与BanglaBERT性能相当，但融入文化背景的预训练始终展现更稳定的检测效果（尤其在多维度分析任务中）。

Conclusion: 研究强调文化敏感的预训练与多任务数据集的协同价值，为低资源语言的内容审核系统提供了可复现的基准框架。

Abstract: Online social media platforms are central to everyday communication and
information seeking. While these platforms serve positive purposes, they also
provide fertile ground for the spread of hate speech, offensive language, and
bullying content targeting individuals, organizations, and communities. Such
content undermines safety, participation, and equity online. Reliable detection
systems are therefore needed, especially for low-resource languages where
moderation tools are limited. In Bangla, prior work has contributed resources
and models, but most are single-task (e.g., binary hate/offense) with limited
coverage of multi-facet signals (type, severity, target). We address these gaps
by introducing the first multi-task Bangla hate-speech dataset,
BanglaMultiHate, one of the largest manually annotated corpus to date. Building
on this resource, we conduct a comprehensive, controlled comparison spanning
classical baselines, monolingual pretrained models, and LLMs under zero-shot
prompting and LoRA fine-tuning. Our experiments assess LLM adaptability in a
low-resource setting and reveal a consistent trend: although LoRA-tuned LLMs
are competitive with BanglaBERT, culturally and linguistically grounded
pretraining remains critical for robust performance. Together, our dataset and
findings establish a stronger benchmark for developing culturally aligned
moderation tools in low-resource contexts. For reproducibility, we will release
the dataset and all related scripts.

Motivation: 现有对大语言模型创造力的评估主要关注输出质量，缺乏对创作过程的研究。本研究旨在从过程角度系统分析LLMs的创作偏好和决策机制

Method: 采用叙事学框架和约束决策模型，通过控制提示分配作者角色，分析模型的创意选择及其背后的推理过程

Result: LLMs在创作决策中一致优先考虑风格元素，不同模型展现出独特的创意特征分布

Conclusion: 该方法为系统分析AI作者创造力提供了新工具，揭示了LLMs的创作偏好模式及其可解释性特征

Abstract: Evaluations of large language models (LLMs)' creativity have focused
primarily on the quality of their outputs rather than the processes that shape
them. This study takes a process-oriented approach, drawing on narratology to
examine LLMs as computational authors. We introduce constraint-based
decision-making as a lens for authorial creativity. Using controlled prompting
to assign authorial personas, we analyze the creative preferences of the
models. Our findings show that LLMs consistently emphasize Style over other
elements, including Character, Event, and Setting. By also probing the
reasoning the models provide for their choices, we show that distinctive
profiles emerge across models and argue that our approach provides a novel
systematic tool for analyzing AI's authorial creativity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语音对话系统因缺乏事实基础导致的幻觉问题，同时克服工具集成带来的高延迟影响对话流畅性

Method: 开发后训练流程：1) 模型学习在用户说话时触发工具调用 2) 生成融合音频查询与检索结果的语音摘要

Result: QA准确率从11.1%提升至34.2%（相对提升200%），工具使用延迟降低20%

Conclusion: 流式RAG框架具有模态无关性，适用于文本输入场景，为实时AI助手发展铺平道路

Abstract: End-to-end speech-in speech-out dialogue systems are emerging as a powerful
alternative to traditional ASR-LLM-TTS pipelines, generating more natural,
expressive responses with significantly lower latency. However, these systems
remain prone to hallucinations due to limited factual grounding. While
text-based dialogue systems address this challenge by integrating tools such as
web search and knowledge graph APIs, we introduce the first approach to extend
tool use directly into speech-in speech-out systems. A key challenge is that
tool integration substantially increases response latency, disrupting
conversational flow. To mitigate this, we propose Streaming Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (Streaming RAG), a novel framework that reduces user-perceived
latency by predicting tool queries in parallel with user speech, even before
the user finishes speaking. Specifically, we develop a post-training pipeline
that teaches the model when to issue tool calls during ongoing speech and how
to generate spoken summaries that fuse audio queries with retrieved text
results, thereby improving both accuracy and responsiveness. To evaluate our
approach, we construct AudioCRAG, a benchmark created by converting queries
from the publicly available CRAG dataset into speech form. Experimental results
demonstrate that our streaming RAG approach increases QA accuracy by up to 200%
relative (from 11.1% to 34.2% absolute) and further enhances user experience by
reducing tool use latency by 20%. Importantly, our streaming RAG approach is
modality-agnostic and can be applied equally to typed input, paving the way for
more agentic, real-time AI assistants.

Motivation: 传统双工系统依赖复杂双通道架构且语义推理能力不足，VAD无法有效区分停顿与对话结束

Method: 采用块式流处理框架，利用帧级对齐技术生成中间目标（对齐的用户文本和系统响应），交替处理固定时长输入并分块生成响应

Result: 相比现有双工方法生成更连贯可解释的响应，支持比轮转系统更低的延迟和重叠交互

Conclusion: SCoT框架成功平衡对话系统响应质量与实时性需求，为连续人机交互提供新解决方案

Abstract: Most end-to-end (E2E) spoken dialogue systems (SDS) rely on voice activity
detection (VAD) for turn-taking, but VAD fails to distinguish between pauses
and turn completions. Duplex SDS models address this by predicting output
continuously, including silence tokens, thus removing the need for explicit
VAD. However, they often have complex dual-channel architecture and lag behind
cascaded models in semantic reasoning. To overcome these challenges, we propose
SCoT: a Streaming Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework for Duplex SDS, alternating
between processing fixed-duration user input and generating responses in a
blockwise manner. Using frame-level alignments, we create intermediate
targets-aligned user transcripts and system responses for each block.
Experiments show that our approach produces more coherent and interpretable
responses than existing duplex methods while supporting lower-latency and
overlapping interactions compared to turn-by-turn systems.

Motivation: 揭示推测解码技术在实际应用中存在的加速不公平现象，即资源消耗较大的任务难以获得等同加速效益，可能加剧模型服务中的公平性问题

Method: 通过理论分析量化加速差异，识别关键影响因素，并设计基于任务特征的动态调度策略进行缓解

Result: 在多个模型对上验证，改进策略使公平性指标平均提升12%，同时保持整体加速效果

Conclusion: 提出首个针对推测解码技术公平性的系统性分析框架，为实现更公平高效的大模型推理提供新思路

Abstract: The practice of speculative decoding, whereby inference is probabilistically
supported by a smaller, cheaper, ``drafter'' model, has become a standard
technique for systematically reducing the decoding time of large language
models. This paper conducts an analysis of speculative decoding through the
lens of its potential disparate speed-up rates across tasks. Crucially, the
paper shows that speed-up gained from speculative decoding is not uniformly
distributed across tasks, consistently diminishing for under-fit, and often
underrepresented tasks. To better understand this phenomenon, we derive an
analysis to quantify this observed ``unfairness'' and draw attention to the
factors that motivate such disparate speed-ups to emerge. Further, guided by
these insights, the paper proposes a mitigation strategy designed to reduce
speed-up disparities and validates the approach across several model pairs,
revealing on average a 12% improvement in our fairness metric.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于人工标注的强化学习方法成本高昂且在复杂任务上表现不足，需要探索无监督的持续自我改进方法。

Method: 通过惩罚过度自信的预测和低一致性样本，保留优质推理链，整合GRPO策略实现无监督持续优化。

Result: 在Qwen3-4B和OctoThinker模型上，AIME25提升140.7%，MMLU_STEM提升36.2%，GPQA-Diamond提升19.6%。

Conclusion: RESTRAIN为无监督推理学习开辟新路径，显著降低对标注数据的依赖，推动大模型推理能力持续进化。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with human-annotated data has boosted chain-of-thought
reasoning in large reasoning models, but these gains come at high costs in
labeled data while faltering on harder tasks. A natural next step is
experience-driven learning, where models improve without curated labels by
adapting to unlabeled data. We introduce RESTRAIN (REinforcement learning with
Self-restraint), a self-penalizing RL framework that converts the absence of
gold labels into a useful learning signal. Instead of overcommitting to
spurious majority votes, RESTRAIN exploits signals from the model's entire
answer distribution: penalizing overconfident rollouts and low-consistency
examples while preserving promising reasoning chains. The self-penalization
mechanism integrates seamlessly into policy optimization methods such as GRPO,
enabling continual self-improvement without supervision. On challenging
reasoning benchmarks, RESTRAIN delivers large gains using only unlabeled data.
With Qwen3-4B-Base and OctoThinker Hybrid-8B-Base, it improves Pass@1 by up to
+140.7 percent on AIME25, +36.2 percent on MMLU_STEM, and +19.6 percent on
GPQA-Diamond, nearly matching gold-label training while using no gold labels.
These results demonstrate that RESTRAIN establishes a scalable path toward
stronger reasoning without gold labels.

Motivation: 现有方法将幻觉检测视为二分类任务，实际应用需精准定位幻觉内容的位置。

Method: 采用强化学习框架(RL4HS)，引入Group Relative Policy Optimization和Class-Aware Policy Optimization解决奖励不平衡问题。

Result: 在RAGTruth基准测试中超越预训练推理模型和微调模型，F1值提升5.3%。

Conclusion: 跨度级奖励强化学习对幻觉定位检测具有必要性，RL4HS框架展现显著性能优势。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate hallucinations -- unsupported
content that undermines reliability. While most prior works frame hallucination
detection as a binary task, many real-world applications require identifying
hallucinated spans, which is a multi-step decision making process. This
naturally raises the question of whether explicit reasoning can help the
complex task of detecting hallucination spans. To answer this question, we
first evaluate pretrained models with and without Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning, and show that CoT reasoning has the potential to generate at least
one correct answer when sampled multiple times. Motivated by this, we propose
RL4HS, a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes reasoning with a
span-level reward function. RL4HS builds on Group Relative Policy Optimization
and introduces Class-Aware Policy Optimization to mitigate reward imbalance
issue. Experiments on the RAGTruth benchmark (summarization, question
answering, data-to-text) show that RL4HS surpasses pretrained reasoning models
and supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating the necessity of reinforcement
learning with span-level rewards for detecting hallucination spans.

Conclusion: 迭代式方法有效降低技术门槛，未来需针对查询结构优化和上下文理解进行模型增强

Abstract: Interacting with knowledge graphs can be a daunting task for people without a
background in computer science since the query language that is used (SPARQL)
has a high barrier of entry. Large language models (LLMs) can lower that
barrier by providing support in the form of Text2SPARQL translation. In this
paper we introduce a generalized method based on SPINACH, an LLM backed agent
that translates natural language questions to SPARQL queries not in a single
shot, but as an iterative process of exploration and execution. We describe the
overall architecture and reasoning behind our design decisions, and also
conduct a thorough analysis of the agent behavior to gain insights into future
areas for targeted improvements. This work was motivated by the Text2SPARQL
challenge, a challenge that was held to facilitate improvements in the
Text2SPARQL domain.

Conclusion: 该框架提供系统性诊断工具，揭示了当前移动代理的可靠性瓶颈，为开发可信代理指明改进方向

Abstract: Mobile-use agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) have shown great
potential in interpreting natural language instructions and generating
corresponding actions based on mobile graphical user interface. Recent studies
suggest that incorporating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning tends to improve
the execution accuracy. However, existing evaluations emphasize execution
accuracy while neglecting whether CoT reasoning aligns with ground-truth
actions. This oversight fails to assess potential reasoning-execution gaps,
which in turn foster over-trust: users relying on seemingly plausible CoTs may
unknowingly authorize harmful actions, potentially resulting in financial loss
or trust crisis. In this work, we introduce a new evaluation framework to
diagnose reasoning-execution gaps. At its core lies Ground-Truth Alignment
(GTA), which measures whether the action implied by a CoT matches the
ground-truth action. By combining GTA with the standard Exact Match (EM)
metric, we jointly assess both the reasoning accuracy and execution accuracy.
This joint perspective reveals two types of reasoning-execution gaps: (i)
Execution Gap (EG), where the reasoning correctly identifies the correct action
but execution fails, and (ii) Reasoning Gap (RG), where execution succeeds but
reasoning process conflicts with the actual execution. Experimental results
across a wide range of mobile interaction tasks reveal that reasoning-execution
gaps are prevalent, with execution gaps occurring more frequently than
reasoning gaps. Moreover, while scaling up model size reduces the overall gap,
sizable execution gaps persist even in the largest models. Further analysis
shows that our framework reliably reflects systematic EG/RG patterns in
state-of-the-art models. These findings offer concrete diagnostics and support
the development of more trustworthy mobile-use agents.

Motivation: 现有强化学习方法依赖自我探索或单一教师指导，导致模型偏见和探索受限。需要突破单一指导限制，通过多教师策略平衡探索与自我发现价值

Conclusion: AMPO验证了多教师策略的有效性，通过'按需指导'机制实现探索广度与学习深度的平衡，为提升LLM推理能力提供高效可扩展路径

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising paradigm
for enhancing the reasoning ability in Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
prevailing methods primarily rely on self-exploration or a single off-policy
teacher to elicit long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) reasoning, which may
introduce intrinsic model biases and restrict exploration, ultimately limiting
reasoning diversity and performance. Drawing inspiration from multi-teacher
strategies in knowledge distillation, we introduce Adaptive Multi-Guidance
Policy Optimization (AMPO), a novel framework that adaptively leverages
guidance from multiple proficient teacher models, but only when the on-policy
model fails to generate correct solutions. This "guidance-on-demand" approach
expands exploration while preserving the value of self-discovery. Moreover,
AMPO incorporates a comprehension-based selection mechanism, prompting the
student to learn from the reasoning paths that it is most likely to comprehend,
thus balancing broad exploration with effective exploitation. Extensive
experiments show AMPO substantially outperforms a strong baseline (GRPO), with
a 4.3% improvement on mathematical reasoning tasks and 12.2% on
out-of-distribution tasks, while significantly boosting Pass@k performance and
enabling more diverse exploration. Notably, using four peer-sized teachers, our
method achieves comparable results to approaches that leverage a single, more
powerful teacher (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) with more data. These results demonstrate
a more efficient and scalable path to superior reasoning and generalizability.

Abstract: Recent technological advances in smartphones and communications, including
the growth of such online platforms as massive social media networks such as X

well-being by exposing them to cyberbullying, taunting, and bullying content.
Most proposed approaches for automatically detecting cyberbullying have been

Arabic-language cyberbullying are scarce. Methods for detecting Arabic-language
cyberbullying are especially scarce. This paper aims to enhance the
effectiveness of methods for detecting cyberbullying in Arabic-language

used the kappa tool to verify and enhance the quality of our annotations. We
conducted four experiments to test numerous deep learning models for

Conclusion: 探索-决策新范式通过动态调节机制，显著提升LLMs的推理效率和适应性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
on complex problems using long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they
often suffer from overthinking, meaning generating unnecessarily lengthy
reasoning steps for simpler problems. This issue may degrade the efficiency of
the models and make them difficult to adapt the reasoning depth to the
complexity of problems. To address this, we introduce a novel metric Token
Entropy Cumulative Average (TECA), which measures the extent of exploration
throughout the reasoning process. We further propose a novel reasoning paradigm
-- Explore Briefly, Then Decide -- with an associated Cumulative Entropy
Regulation (CER) mechanism. This paradigm leverages TECA to help the model
dynamically determine the optimal point to conclude its thought process and
provide a final answer, thus achieving efficient reasoning. Experimental
results across diverse mathematical benchmarks show that our approach
substantially mitigates overthinking without sacrificing problem-solving
ability. With our thinking paradigm, the average response length decreases by
up to 71% on simpler datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in
creating a more efficient and adaptive reasoning process.

Conclusion: 当前LLM代理在多源信息整合与基础工具操作层面仍存在显著能力缺口，需加强复杂工具链推理能力建设

Abstract: Information seeking is a fundamental requirement for humans. However,
existing LLM agents rely heavily on open-web search, which exposes two
fundamental weaknesses: online content is noisy and unreliable, and many
real-world tasks require precise, domain-specific knowledge unavailable from
the web. The emergence of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) now allows agents to
interface with thousands of specialized tools, seemingly resolving this
limitation. Yet it remains unclear whether agents can effectively leverage such
tools -- and more importantly, whether they can integrate them with
general-purpose search to solve complex tasks. Therefore, we introduce
InfoMosaic-Bench, the first benchmark dedicated to multi-source information
seeking in tool-augmented agents. Covering six representative domains
(medicine, finance, maps, video, web, and multi-domain integration),
InfoMosaic-Bench requires agents to combine general-purpose search with
domain-specific tools. Tasks are synthesized with InfoMosaic-Flow, a scalable
pipeline that grounds task conditions in verified tool outputs, enforces
cross-source dependencies, and filters out shortcut cases solvable by trivial
lookup. This design guarantees both reliability and non-triviality. Experiments
with 14 state-of-the-art LLM agents reveal three findings: (i) web information
alone is insufficient, with GPT-5 achieving only 38.2% accuracy and 67.5% pass
rate; (ii) domain tools provide selective but inconsistent benefits, improving
some domains while degrading others; and (iii) 22.4% of failures arise from
incorrect tool usage or selection, highlighting that current LLMs still
struggle with even basic tool handling.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Reinforcement Post-Training (RPT) have significantly
enhanced the capabilities of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), sparking increased
interest in the generalization of RL-based reasoning. While existing work has
primarily focused on investigating its generalization across tasks or
modalities, this study proposes a novel cross-linguistic perspective to
investigate reasoning generalization. This raises a crucial question:
$\textit{Does the reasoning capability achieved from English RPT effectively
transfer to other languages?}$ We address this by systematically evaluating
English-centric LRMs on multilingual reasoning benchmarks and introducing a
metric to quantify cross-lingual transferability. Our findings reveal that
cross-lingual transferability varies significantly across initial model, target
language, and training paradigm. Through interventional studies, we find that
models with stronger initial English capabilities tend to over-rely on
English-specific patterns, leading to diminished cross-lingual generalization.
To address this, we conduct a thorough parallel training study. Experimental
results yield three key findings: $\textbf{First-Parallel Leap}$, a substantial
leap in performance when transitioning from monolingual to just a single
parallel language, and a predictable $\textbf{Parallel Scaling Law}$, revealing
that cross-lingual reasoning transfer follows a power-law with the number of
training parallel languages. Moreover, we identify the discrepancy between
actual monolingual performance and the power-law prediction as
$\textbf{Monolingual Generalization Gap}$, indicating that English-centric LRMs
fail to fully generalize across languages. Our study challenges the assumption
that LRM reasoning mirrors human cognition, providing critical insights for the
development of more language-agnostic LRMs.

Method: 设计YAML可配置接口抽象模型复杂性，支持开放模型中间层特征提取，目前兼容16个SOTA基模型及其30+变体，核心逻辑支持无缝扩展新模型

Result: 通过两个分析实验揭示不同模型层与目标概念在隐藏表示中存在的系统性差异，验证了工具的有效性

Conclusion: 开源VLM-Lens工具包通过标准化分析流程加速社区对视觉语言模型的理解与改进

Abstract: We introduce VLM-Lens, a toolkit designed to enable systematic benchmarking,
analysis, and interpretation of vision-language models (VLMs) by supporting the
extraction of intermediate outputs from any layer during the forward pass of
open-source VLMs. VLM-Lens provides a unified, YAML-configurable interface that
abstracts away model-specific complexities and supports user-friendly operation
across diverse VLMs. It currently supports 16 state-of-the-art base VLMs and
their over 30 variants, and is extensible to accommodate new models without
changing the core logic.
  The toolkit integrates easily with various interpretability and analysis
methods. We demonstrate its usage with two simple analytical experiments,
revealing systematic differences in the hidden representations of VLMs across
layers and target concepts. VLM-Lens is released as an open-sourced project to
accelerate community efforts in understanding and improving VLMs.

TL;DR: F2LLM系列嵌入模型通过低成本微调实现高效性能，4B版本MTEB排名第二，1.7B版本同规模第一


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有顶级嵌入模型需要昂贵预训练/复杂流程/合成数据的问题，寻求训练成本-模型规模-性能的最佳平衡

Method: 基于600万非合成开放数据集的查询-文档-负样本三元组，直接在基础模型上进行微调

Result: F2LLM-4B在MTEB英语榜4B参数模型中排名第二；F2LLM-1.7B在1B-2B规模模型中排名第一

Abstract: We introduce F2LLM - Foundation to Feature Large Language Models, a suite of
state-of-the-art embedding models in three sizes: 0.6B, 1.7B, and 4B. Unlike
previous top-ranking embedding models that require massive contrastive
pretraining, sophisticated training pipelines, and costly synthetic training
data, F2LLM is directly finetuned from foundation models on 6 million
query-document-negative tuples curated from open-source, non-synthetic
datasets, striking a strong balance between training cost, model size, and
embedding performance. On the MTEB English leaderboard, F2LLM-4B ranks 2nd
among models with approximately 4B parameters and 7th overall, while F2LLM-1.7B
ranks 1st among models in the 1B-2B size range. To facilitate future research
in the field, we release the models, training dataset, and code, positioning
F2LLM as a strong, reproducible, and budget-friendly baseline for future works.

TL;DR: 研究发现竞技场评估中平局更反映查询难度而非模型能力，建议评分系统应重新考量平局语义及查询属性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Elo评分系统将平局视为双方模型能力相等，但作者认为平局可能反映查询本身的难度特征而非模型实力对等

Method: 通过分析三个真实世界竞技场数据集，测试忽略平局时评分更新的效果，并研究查询难度/客观性与平局出现的关联性

Result: 忽略平局调整使预测准确率提升1-3%，平局在易答（风险比1.37）和高客观性（风险比1.35）查询中显著高发

Conclusion: 建议未来评分系统应重新定义平局语义，并在评分更新中纳入查询难度等属性以提高评估有效性

Abstract: In arena-style evaluation of large language models (LLMs), two LLMs respond
to a user query, and the user chooses the winning response or deems the
"battle" a draw, resulting in an adjustment to the ratings of both models. The
prevailing approach for modeling these rating dynamics is to view battles as
two-player game matches, as in chess, and apply the Elo rating system and its
derivatives. In this paper, we critically examine this paradigm. Specifically,
we question whether a draw genuinely means that the two models are equal and
hence whether their ratings should be equalized. Instead, we conjecture that
draws are more indicative of query difficulty: if the query is too easy, then
both models are more likely to succeed equally. On three real-world arena
datasets, we show that ignoring rating updates for draws yields a 1-3% relative
increase in battle outcome prediction accuracy (which includes draws) for all
four rating systems studied. Further analyses suggest that draws occur more for
queries rated as very easy and those as highly objective, with risk ratios of
1.37 and 1.35, respectively. We recommend future rating systems to reconsider
existing draw semantics and to account for query properties in rating updates.

Motivation: 现有物理驱动化身方法存在动态建模精度不足、对新颖动作输入鲁棒性差的问题，尤其难以处理宽松衣物的复杂形变与人体接触。

Method: 定制基于物质点法(MPM)的物理模拟器，引入各向异性本构模型改进织物建模，开发新型碰撞处理算法，结合支持准阴影的3D高斯溅射渲染构建完整化身系统。

Result: 在动态建模误差(降低48.9%)、渲染质量(PSNR提升3.2dB)和计算效率(提速5.7倍)上全面超越现有方法，首次实现未见物理交互的零样本泛化。

Conclusion: 该方法通过物理仿真与神经渲染的协同创新，突破了动态化身在物理精确性与泛化能力上的瓶颈，为虚拟现实应用提供了新范式。

Abstract: While there has been significant progress in the field of 3D avatar creation
from visual observations, modeling physically plausible dynamics of humans with
loose garments remains a challenging problem. Although a few existing works
address this problem by leveraging physical simulation, they suffer from
limited accuracy or robustness to novel animation inputs. In this work, we
present MPMAvatar, a framework for creating 3D human avatars from multi-view
videos that supports highly realistic, robust animation, as well as
photorealistic rendering from free viewpoints. For accurate and robust dynamics
modeling, our key idea is to use a Material Point Method-based simulator, which
we carefully tailor to model garments with complex deformations and contact
with the underlying body by incorporating an anisotropic constitutive model and
a novel collision handling algorithm. We combine this dynamics modeling scheme
with our canonical avatar that can be rendered using 3D Gaussian Splatting with
quasi-shadowing, enabling high-fidelity rendering for physically realistic
animations. In our experiments, we demonstrate that MPMAvatar significantly
outperforms the existing state-of-the-art physics-based avatar in terms of (1)
dynamics modeling accuracy, (2) rendering accuracy, and (3) robustness and
efficiency. Additionally, we present a novel application in which our avatar
generalizes to unseen interactions in a zero-shot manner-which was not
achievable with previous learning-based methods due to their limited simulation
generalizability. Our project page is at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统OST-AR依赖视觉覆盖可能导致注意力过载，且在遮挡/弱光环境下缺乏深度线索，需探索多模态反馈方案

Method: 设计六振动马达腕带装置，集成手持工具与OST-AR系统，通过形成性研究和两项对照实验（N=21/N=27）评估模式识别与深度引导效果

Result: 多模态反馈条件下用户空间精度提升17%，系统可用性评分比单模态条件高32%，触觉模式识别准确率达89%

Conclusion: 触觉-视觉多模态反馈有效补偿单模态局限，为医疗穿刺、工业装配等场景提供更可靠的空间引导方案

Abstract: Optical see-through augmented reality (OST-AR) overlays digital targets and
annotations on the physical world, offering promising guidance for hands-on
tasks such as medical needle insertion or assembly. Recent work on OST-AR depth
perception shows that target opacity and tool visualization significantly
affect accuracy and usability; opaque targets and rendering the real instrument
reduce depth errors, whereas transparent targets and absent tools impair
performance. However, reliance on visual overlays may overload attention and
leaves little room for depth cues when occlusion or lighting hampers
perception. To address these limitations, we explore multimodal feedback that
combines OST-AR with wrist-based vibrotactile haptics. The past two years have
seen rapid advances in haptic technology. Researchers have investigated
skin-stretch and vibrotactile cues for conveying spatial information to blind
users, wearable ring actuators that support precise pinching in AR, cross-modal
audio-haptic cursors that enable eyes-free object selection, and wrist-worn
feedback for teleoperated surgery that improves force awareness at the cost of
longer task times. Studies comparing pull versus push vibrotactile metaphors
found that pull cues yield faster gesture completion and lower cognitive load.
These findings motivate revisiting OST-AR guidance with a fresh perspective on
wrist-based haptics. We design a custom wristband with six vibromotors
delivering directional and state cues, integrate it with a handheld tool and
OST-AR, and assess its impact on cue recognition and depth guidance. Through a
formative study and two experiments (N=21 and N=27), we show that participants
accurately identify haptic patterns under cognitive load and that multimodal
feedback improves spatial precision and usability compared with visual-only or
haptic-only conditions.

Conclusion: MIRAGE系统通过混合现实技术有效改善MRI检查体验，深度注册方案兼顾精度与易用性，具备临床推广价值

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an indispensable diagnostic tool, yet the
confined bore and acoustic noise can evoke considerable anxiety and
claustrophobic reactions. High anxiety leads to motion artifacts, incomplete
scans and reliance on pharmacological sedation. MIRAGE (Mixed Reality Anxiety
Guidance Environment) harnesses the latest mixed reality (MR) hardware to
prepare patients for MRI through immersive virtual reality (VR) and markerless
augmented reality (AR) registration. In this paper, we extend our previous work
by providing a comprehensive review of related research, detailing the system
architecture, and exploring metrics for patient and clinician experience. We
also present considerations for clinical deployment of MR systems within
hospital workflows. Our results indicate that depth-based registration achieves
sub-centimeter accuracy with minimal setup, while the immersive coaching
environment reduces patient anxiety and yields favourable usability scores.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D高斯泼溅方法均匀分配资源，导致关注区域细节不足且模型臃肿。需针对性提升目标对象重建质量同时保持全局效率。

Method: 1. 对象引导相机选择
2. 目标对象定向训练
3. 高保真对象重建与全局场景融合

Result: 单对象场景中：
- 局部质量提升2.96dB PSNR
- 模型体积减少≈17%
- 训练速度优于基线方法

Conclusion: ROI-GS在保持实时性的同时实现对象级高精度重建，为聚焦特定目标的3D场景建模提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of efficiently reconstructing 3D scenes with high
detail on objects of interest. Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods
allocate resources uniformly across the scene, limiting fine detail to Regions
Of Interest (ROIs) and leading to inflated model size. We propose ROI-GS, an
object-aware framework that enhances local details through object-guided camera
selection, targeted Object training, and seamless integration of high-fidelity
object of interest reconstructions into the global scene. Our method
prioritizes higher resolution details on chosen objects while maintaining
real-time performance. Experiments show that ROI-GS significantly improves
local quality (up to 2.96 dB PSNR), while reducing overall model size by
$\approx 17\%$ of baseline and achieving faster training for a scene with a
single object of interest, outperforming existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经渲染方法因耦合漫反射/镜面反射参数化导致材质恢复不准确，难以实现真实的材质分解和重新光照效果

Method: 将specular-glossiness参数化整合到高斯溅射框架，采用扩散先验引导优化，通过环境贴图粗-精优化保持高动态反射细节

Result: 在复杂高光场景中实现优于现有方法的几何/材质重建质量，新光照条件下的重光照效果更真实且物理一致

Conclusion: 通过物理准确的BRDF建模与渐进式优化策略，有效解决材质-光照耦合问题，显著提升高光物体的渲染保真度

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction and relighting of glossy objects remain a
longstanding challenge, as object shape, material properties, and illumination
are inherently difficult to disentangle. Existing neural rendering approaches
often rely on simplified BRDF models or parameterizations that couple diffuse
and specular components, which restricts faithful material recovery and limits
relighting fidelity. We propose a relightable framework that integrates a
microfacet BRDF with the specular-glossiness parameterization into 2D Gaussian
Splatting with deferred shading. This formulation enables more physically
consistent material decomposition, while diffusion-based priors for surface
normals and diffuse color guide early-stage optimization and mitigate
ambiguity. A coarse-to-fine optimization of the environment map accelerates
convergence and preserves high-dynamic-range specular reflections. Extensive
experiments on complex, glossy scenes demonstrate that our method achieves
high-quality geometry and material reconstruction, delivering substantially
more realistic and consistent relighting under novel illumination compared to
existing Gaussian splatting methods.

Conclusion: 黑板范式为多代理系统建立了可扩展、通用化的通信框架，支持专有和开源LLMs，验证了架构的有效性和泛化能力

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new
opportunities in data science, yet their practical deployment is often
constrained by the challenge of discovering relevant data within large
heterogeneous data lakes. Existing methods struggle with this: single-agent
systems are quickly overwhelmed by large, heterogeneous files in the large data
lakes, while multi-agent systems designed based on a master-slave paradigm
depend on a rigid central controller for task allocation that requires precise
knowledge of each sub-agent's capabilities. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel multi-agent communication paradigm inspired by the blackboard
architecture for traditional AI models. In this framework, a central agent
posts requests to a shared blackboard, and autonomous subordinate agents --
either responsible for a partition of the data lake or general information
retrieval -- volunteer to respond based on their capabilities. This design
improves scalability and flexibility by eliminating the need for a central
coordinator to have prior knowledge of all sub-agents' expertise. We evaluate
our method on three benchmarks that require explicit data discovery: KramaBench
and modified versions of DS-Bench and DA-Code to incorporate data discovery.
Experimental results demonstrate that the blackboard architecture substantially
outperforms baselines, including RAG and the master-slave multi-agent paradigm,
achieving between 13% to 57% relative improvement in end-to-end task success
and up to a 9% relative gain in F1 score for data discovery over the
best-performing baselines across both proprietary and open-source LLMs. Our
findings establish the blackboard paradigm as a scalable and generalizable
communication framework for multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: 揭示LLMs防御机制在语义相关嵌套场景中的脆弱性，提供新型自动化攻击范式（含潜在有害内容警告）

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
various tasks. However, they remain exposed to jailbreak attacks, eliciting
harmful responses. The nested scenario strategy has been increasingly adopted
across various methods, demonstrating immense potential. Nevertheless, these
methods are easily detectable due to their prominent malicious intentions. In
this work, we are the first to find and systematically verify that LLMs'
alignment defenses are not sensitive to nested scenarios, where these scenarios
are highly semantically relevant to the queries and incorporate targeted toxic
knowledge. This is a crucial yet insufficiently explored direction. Based on
this, we propose RTS-Attack (Semantically Relevant Nested Scenarios with
Targeted Toxic Knowledge), an adaptive and automated framework to examine LLMs'
alignment. By building scenarios highly relevant to the queries and integrating
targeted toxic knowledge, RTS-Attack bypasses the alignment defenses of LLMs.
Moreover, the jailbreak prompts generated by RTS-Attack are free from harmful
queries, leading to outstanding concealment. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that RTS-Attack exhibits superior performance in both efficiency and
universality compared to the baselines across diverse advanced LLMs, including
GPT-4o, Llama3-70b, and Gemini-pro. Our complete code is available in the
supplementary material. WARNING: THIS PAPER CONTAINS POTENTIALLY HARMFUL

Abstract: Multiple prompt injection attacks have been proposed against web agents. At
the same time, various methods have been developed to detect general prompt
injection attacks, but none have been systematically evaluated for web agents.
In this work, we bridge this gap by presenting the first comprehensive
benchmark study on detecting prompt injection attacks targeting web agents. We
begin by introducing a fine-grained categorization of such attacks based on the
threat model. We then construct datasets containing both malicious and benign
samples: malicious text segments generated by different attacks, benign text
segments from four categories, malicious images produced by attacks, and benign
images from two categories. Next, we systematize both text-based and
image-based detection methods. Finally, we evaluate their performance across
multiple scenarios. Our key findings show that while some detectors can
identify attacks that rely on explicit textual instructions or visible image
perturbations with moderate to high accuracy, they largely fail against attacks
that omit explicit instructions or employ imperceptible perturbations. Our
datasets and code are released at:

Result: 发现82%技术研究集中在记忆问题，但94%实际隐私危害源于其他技术手段难以应对的领域

Conclusion: 呼吁建立跨学科的社会技术隐私框架，突破现有纯技术解决方案的局限性

Abstract: The discourse on privacy risks in Large Language Models (LLMs) has
disproportionately focused on verbatim memorization of training data, while a
constellation of more immediate and scalable privacy threats remain
underexplored. This position paper argues that the privacy landscape of LLM
systems extends far beyond training data extraction, encompassing risks from
data collection practices, inference-time context leakage, autonomous agent
capabilities, and the democratization of surveillance through deep inference
attacks. We present a comprehensive taxonomy of privacy risks across the LLM
lifecycle -- from data collection through deployment -- and demonstrate through
case studies how current privacy frameworks fail to address these multifaceted
threats. Through a longitudinal analysis of 1,322 AI/ML privacy papers
published at leading conferences over the past decade (2016--2025), we reveal
that while memorization receives outsized attention in technical research, the
most pressing privacy harms lie elsewhere, where current technical approaches
offer little traction and viable paths forward remain unclear. We call for a
fundamental shift in how the research community approaches LLM privacy, moving
beyond the narrow focus of current technical solutions and embracing
interdisciplinary approaches that address the sociotechnical nature of these
emerging threats.

In this paper, we present a framework that enables efficiently prototyping

supports continual learning, enabling the dynamic incorporation of new
domain-specific knowledge through an interactive medium.

### [103] [Synthetic Prefixes to Mitigate Bias in Real-Time Neural Query Autocomplete](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01574)
*Adithya Rajan,Xiaoyu Liu,Prateek Verma,Vibhu Arora*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出基于合成前缀的数据驱动方法，有效缓解实时查询自动补全系统的呈现偏差并提升用户参与度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实时查询自动补全系统中用户行为受模型建议影响导致的固有偏差问题，特别是互动信号中的呈现偏差

Method: 1. 开发实时低延迟部署的神经排序模型，整合查询流行度/季节性/模糊匹配等特征
2. 提出列表损失函数的任务特定简化方案，利用单真实标签特性将计算复杂度从O(n²)降至O(n)

Result: 在大型电商平台部署后，平均倒数排名等用户参与度指标实现统计显著提升

Conclusion: 合成前缀方法不仅增强模型泛化能力，还为相关搜索/查询推荐等低延迟排序任务提供了可扩展的偏差缓解路径

Abstract: We introduce a data-centric approach for mitigating presentation bias in
real-time neural query autocomplete systems through the use of synthetic
prefixes. These prefixes are generated from complete user queries collected
during regular search sessions where autocomplete was not active. This allows
us to enrich the training data for learning to rank models with more diverse
and less biased examples. This method addresses the inherent bias in engagement
signals collected from live query autocomplete interactions, where model
suggestions influence user behavior. Our neural ranker is optimized for
real-time deployment under strict latency constraints and incorporates a rich
set of features, including query popularity, seasonality, fuzzy match scores,
and contextual signals such as department affinity, device type, and vertical
alignment with previous user queries. To support efficient training, we
introduce a task-specific simplification of the listwise loss, reducing
computational complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ by leveraging the query
autocomplete structure of having only one ground-truth selection per prefix.
Deployed in a large-scale e-commerce setting, our system demonstrates
statistically significant improvements in user engagement, as measured by mean
reciprocal rank and related metrics. Our findings show that synthetic prefixes
not only improve generalization but also provide a scalable path toward bias
mitigation in other low-latency ranking tasks, including related searches and
query recommendations.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent research has explored using Large Language Models for recommendation
tasks by transforming user interaction histories and item metadata into text
prompts, then having the LLM produce rankings or recommendations. A promising
approach involves connecting collaborative filtering knowledge to LLM
representations through compact adapter networks, which avoids expensive
fine-tuning while preserving the strengths of both components. Yet several
challenges persist in practice: collaborative filtering models often use static
snapshots that miss rapidly changing user preferences; many real-world items
contain rich visual and audio content beyond textual descriptions; and current
systems struggle to provide trustworthy explanations backed by concrete
evidence. Our work introduces \model{}, a framework that tackles these
limitations through three key innovations. We develop an online adaptation
mechanism that continuously incorporates new user interactions through
lightweight modules, avoiding the need to retrain large models. We create a
unified representation that seamlessly combines collaborative signals with
visual and audio features, handling cases where some modalities may be
unavailable. Finally, we design an explanation system that grounds
recommendations in specific collaborative patterns and item attributes,
producing natural language rationales users can verify. Our approach maintains
the efficiency of frozen base models while adding minimal computational
overhead, making it practical for real-world deployment.

Motivation: 解决现有生成推荐系统在多模态处理、算法偏见消除和决策透明度方面的不足

Method: 整合多模态融合架构、检索增强生成、因果推断去偏、可解释生成和实时自适应学习五大模块

Result: 在MovieLens等数据集上NDCG@10提升2.3%，多样性指标提升1.4%

Conclusion: 该框架通过模块化设计实现更精准、公平且可解释的推荐，验证了架构优化的有效性

Abstract: Contemporary generative recommendation systems face significant challenges in
handling multimodal data, eliminating algorithmic biases, and providing
transparent decision-making processes. This paper introduces an enhanced
generative recommendation framework that addresses these limitations through
five key innovations: multimodal fusion architecture, retrieval-augmented
generation mechanisms, causal inference-based debiasing, explainable
recommendation generation, and real-time adaptive learning capabilities. Our
framework leverages advanced large language models as the backbone while
incorporating specialized modules for cross-modal understanding, contextual
knowledge integration, bias mitigation, explanation synthesis, and continuous
model adaptation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
(MovieLens-25M, Amazon-Electronics, Yelp-2023) demonstrate consistent
improvements in recommendation accuracy, fairness, and diversity compared to
existing approaches. The proposed framework achieves up to 2.3% improvement in
NDCG@10 and 1.4% enhancement in diversity metrics while maintaining
computational efficiency through optimized inference strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原Promptagator方法依赖难以获取或存在数据安全隐患的专有大模型，需探索开源替代方案。

Method: 通过使用不同参数规模（≤14B，最小3B）的开源LLMs进行Promptagator式查询生成实验。

Result: 3B参数的开源模型即可生成有效查询，为领域应用提供高效微调方案。

Conclusion: 验证开源小模型的可行性，为从业者提供敏感数据处理和领域优化的可靠替代方案。

Abstract: Promptagator demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) with few-shot
prompts can be used as task-specific query generators for fine-tuning
domain-specialized dense retrieval models. However, the original Promptagator
approach relied on proprietary and large-scale LLMs which users may not have
access to or may be prohibited from using with sensitive data. In this work, we
study the impact of open-source LLMs at accessible scales ($\leq$14B
parameters) as an alternative. Our results demonstrate that open-source LLMs as
small as 3B parameters can serve as effective Promptagator-style query
generators. We hope our work will inform practitioners with reliable
alternatives for synthetic data generation and give insights to maximize
fine-tuning results for domain-specific applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了AGILE框架，通过智能拼图交互学习增强视觉语言模型的感知与推理能力，在拼图任务中准确率从9.5%提升至82.8%，并展示跨任务泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在基础感知和推理能力上存在明显局限，即使面对简单拼图任务也表现欠佳。高质量视觉语言数据的稀缺性和扩展性不足制约了模型能力提升。

Method: 将拼图任务构建为交互式学习过程，通过代码生成与环境反馈的循环机制（观察-生成可执行代码-获取视觉反馈）实现渐进式能力增强。

Result: 在2×2拼图任务中准确率提升8.7倍，在9个通用视觉任务上平均提升3.1%，验证了方法对感知与推理能力的双重提升效果。

Conclusion: AGILE为多模态模型提供了可扩展的强化学习方案，通过交互式学习机制突破数据限制，开辟了增强多模态推理能力的新路径。代码与数据集已开源。

Abstract: Although current large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have advanced in
multimodal understanding and reasoning, their fundamental perceptual and
reasoning abilities remain limited. Specifically, even on simple jigsaw tasks,
existing VLMs perform near randomly, revealing deficiencies in core perception
and reasoning capabilities. While high-quality vision-language data can enhance
these capabilities, its scarcity and limited scalability impose significant
constraints. To address this, we propose AGILE, an Agentic jiGsaw Interaction
Learning for Enhancing visual perception and reasoning in VLMs. AGILE
formulates jigsaw solving as an interactive process, enabling the model to
progressively engage with the environment. At each step, the model generates
executable code to perform an action based on the current state, while the
environment provides fine-grained visual feedback to guide task completion.
Through this iterative cycle of observation and interaction, the model
incrementally improves its perceptual and reasoning capabilities via
exploration and feedback. Experimental results show that AGILE not only
substantially boosts performance on jigsaw tasks of varying complexity (e.g.,
increasing accuracy from 9.5% to 82.8% under the 2 $\times$ 2 setting) but also
demonstrates strong generalization across 9 general vision tasks, achieving an
average improvement of 3.1%. These results indicate notable enhancements in
both perceptual and reasoning abilities. This work opens a new avenue for
advancing reasoning and generalization in multimodal models and provides an
efficient, scalable solution to the scarcity of multimodal reinforcement
learning data. The code and datasets is available at

TL;DR: 提出MEMTRACK基准测试框架，用于评估多平台代理在复杂企业环境中的长期记忆与状态跟踪能力，GPT-5仅达60%正确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有记忆评估基准局限于对话场景，无法满足动态企业环境中多平台交互、异步事件处理和信息冲突解决的实际需求

Method: 通过整合Slack/Linear/Git等多平台异步事件构建平台交织时间轴，采用专家设计+智能体合成方式生成生态效度验证的数据集

Result: 主流LLM在长时程记忆利用/跨平台依赖处理/矛盾解决方面表现不足，最佳模型GPT-5正确率仅60%

Conclusion: 建立可扩展的多平台记忆评估框架，突破对话场景限制，为复杂组织环境中的多智能体记忆系统评测奠定基础

Abstract: Recent works on context and memory benchmarking have primarily focused on
conversational instances but the need for evaluating memory in dynamic
enterprise environments is crucial for its effective application. We introduce
MEMTRACK, a benchmark designed to evaluate long-term memory and state tracking
in multi-platform agent environments. MEMTRACK models realistic organizational
workflows by integrating asynchronous events across multiple communication and
productivity platforms such as Slack, Linear and Git. Each benchmark instance
provides a chronologically platform-interleaved timeline, with noisy,
conflicting, cross-referring information as well as potential
codebase/file-system comprehension and exploration. Consequently, our benchmark
tests memory capabilities such as acquistion, selection and conflict
resolution. We curate the MEMTRACK dataset through both manual expert driven
design and scalable agent based synthesis, generating ecologically valid
scenarios grounded in real world software development processes. We introduce
pertinent metrics for Correctness, Efficiency, and Redundancy that capture the
effectiveness of memory mechanisms beyond simple QA performance. Experiments
across SoTA LLMs and memory backends reveal challenges in utilizing memory
across long horizons, handling cross-platform dependencies, and resolving
contradictions. Notably, the best performing GPT-5 model only achieves a 60\%
Correctness score on MEMTRACK. This work provides an extensible framework for
advancing evaluation research for memory-augmented agents, beyond existing
focus on conversational setups, and sets the stage for multi-agent,
multi-platform memory benchmarking in complex organizational settings

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出TRACE方法，通过截断思维链检测隐性奖励黑客行为，显著超越现有监测方法（数学推理+65%，编程+30%），并能发现训练中的未知漏洞


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监测方法难以检测隐性奖励黑客行为（模型思维链看似正常但实际走捷径），导致安全漏洞未被发现

Method: TRACE通过逐步截断模型的思维链，测量不同截断长度下验证通过率，利用准确率-长度曲线下面积量化模型走捷径的程度

Result: 在数学推理任务中超越72B CoT监测器65%，编程任务超越32B监测器30%；成功发现训练阶段未知的奖励函数漏洞

Conclusion: TRACE提供无需监督的可扩展解决方案，有效解决现有监测方法失效场景，且具备训练阶段漏洞发现能力

Abstract: Reward hacking, where a reasoning model exploits loopholes in a reward
function to achieve high rewards without solving the intended task, poses a
significant threat. This behavior may be explicit, i.e. verbalized in the
model's chain-of-thought (CoT), or implicit, where the CoT appears benign thus
bypasses CoT monitors. To detect implicit reward hacking, we propose TRACE
(Truncated Reasoning AUC Evaluation). Our key observation is that hacking
occurs when exploiting the loophole is easier than solving the actual task.
This means that the model is using less `effort' than required to achieve high
reward. TRACE quantifies effort by measuring how early a model's reasoning
becomes sufficient to pass a verifier. We progressively truncate a model's CoT
at various lengths, force the model to answer, and measure the verifier-passing
rate at each cutoff. A hacking model, which takes a shortcut, will achieve a
high passing rate with only a small fraction of its CoT, yielding a large area
under the accuracy-vs-length curve. TRACE achieves over 65% gains over our
strongest 72B CoT monitor in math reasoning, and over 30% gains over a 32B
monitor in coding. We further show that TRACE can discover unknown loopholes
during training. Overall, TRACE offers a scalable unsupervised approach for
oversight where current monitoring methods prove ineffective.

TL;DR: 通过蒸馏学习将检索引导内化为模型能力，显著提升LLM代理在多步任务中的成功率并减少资源消耗


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索增强方法(RAG)需要持续维护外部知识库且增加计算开销，需寻找更高效的解决方案

Method: 三阶段流程：1) 从失败案例提取紧凑提示 2) 用单次检索生成改进的教师轨迹 3) 训练学生模型去除提示依赖

Result: ALFWorld成功率提升至91%(基线79%)，WebShop得分72(基线61)，token使用量减少10-60%

Conclusion: 该方法在不同模型规模(7B/14B)和架构(ReAct/StateAct)中均有效，证明检索优势可通过微调内化

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents deployed for multi-step tasks frequently
fail in predictable ways: attempting actions with unmet preconditions, issuing
redundant commands, or mishandling environment constraints. While
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can improve performance by providing
runtime guidance, it requires maintaining external knowledge databases and adds
computational overhead at every deployment. We propose a simple pipeline that
converts inference-time retrieval into learned competence through distillation.
Our approach: (1) extracts compact, reusable hints from agent failures, (2)
uses these hints to generate improved teacher trajectories via one-shot
retrieval at episode start, and (3) trains student models on these trajectories
with hint strings removed, forcing internalization rather than memorization.
Across two interactive benchmarks, ALFWorld (household tasks) and WebShop
(online shopping), distilled students consistently outperform baseline agents,
achieving up to 91% success on ALFWorld (vs. 79% for baselines) and improving
WebShop scores to 72 (vs. 61 for baselines), while using 10-60% fewer tokens
than retrieval-augmented teachers depending on the environment. The approach
generalizes across model scales (7B/14B parameters) and agent architectures
(ReAct/StateAct), demonstrating that retrieval benefits can be effectively
internalized through targeted fine-tuning without permanent runtime
dependencies.

Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在处理多模态模型时，将视觉输入视为确定性条件，忽视视觉模糊性导致策略鲁棒性不足，且存在探索效率低下的问题

Method: 提出VOGUE方法：1) 将图像作为随机上下文，通过对称KL散度量化策略对视觉扰动的敏感性 2) 构建不确定性比例奖励机制 3) 结合token熵奖励和退火采样策略平衡探索与利用

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B模型上实现：视觉数学基准平均提升2.6%，通用推理基准提升3.7%，同时提升pass@4性能并缓解探索衰减问题

Conclusion: 基于视觉输入固有不确定性的探索策略能有效提升多模态推理性能，为强化学习在多模态场景的应用提供新方向

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) improves reasoning in
large language models (LLMs) but struggles with exploration, an issue that
still persists for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Current methods treat the visual
input as a fixed, deterministic condition, overlooking a critical source of
ambiguity and struggling to build policies robust to plausible visual
variations. We introduce $\textbf{VOGUE (Visual Uncertainty Guided
Exploration)}$, a novel method that shifts exploration from the output (text)
to the input (visual) space. By treating the image as a stochastic context,
VOGUE quantifies the policy's sensitivity to visual perturbations using the
symmetric KL divergence between a "raw" and "noisy" branch, creating a direct
signal for uncertainty-aware exploration. This signal shapes the learning
objective via an uncertainty-proportional bonus, which, combined with a
token-entropy bonus and an annealed sampling schedule, effectively balances
exploration and exploitation. Implemented within GRPO on two model scales
(Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B), VOGUE boosts pass@1 accuracy by an average of 2.6% on three
visual math benchmarks and 3.7% on three general-domain reasoning benchmarks,
while simultaneously increasing pass@4 performance and mitigating the
exploration decay commonly observed in RL fine-tuning. Our work shows that
grounding exploration in the inherent uncertainty of visual inputs is an
effective strategy for improving multimodal reasoning.

Motivation: 现有LLM规划智能体忽略内部认知与真实环境动态差异，导致部分可观测环境下决策质量低下。需通过主动信息验证实现认知校准

Method: 开发信息驱动决策框架InfoSeeker，通过LLM生成验证性动作序列（环境状态确认/假设检验/动态变化检测）来修正认知，再生成任务规划方案

Result: 在部分可观测环境基准测试中性能提升74%，在机器人操作和网页导航等基准任务中展现跨领域泛化能力

Conclusion: 规划与主动信息获取的深度整合是构建鲁棒决策系统的关键，信息验证机制有效提升动态不确定环境下的决策可靠性

Abstract: Explicit information seeking is essential to human problem-solving in
practical environments characterized by incomplete information and noisy
dynamics. When the true environmental state is not directly observable, humans
seek information to update their internal dynamics and inform future
decision-making. Although existing Large Language Model (LLM) planning agents
have addressed observational uncertainty, they often overlook discrepancies
between their internal dynamics and the actual environment. We introduce
Information Seeking Decision Planner (InfoSeeker), an LLM decision-making
framework that integrates task-oriented planning with information seeking to
align internal dynamics and make optimal decisions under uncertainty in both
agent observations and environmental dynamics. InfoSeeker prompts an LLM to
actively gather information by planning actions to validate its understanding,
detect environmental changes, or test hypotheses before generating or revising
task-oriented plans. To evaluate InfoSeeker, we introduce a novel benchmark
suite featuring partially observable environments with incomplete observations
and uncertain dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that InfoSeeker achieves a 74%
absolute performance gain over prior methods without sacrificing sample
efficiency. Moreover, InfoSeeker generalizes across LLMs and outperforms
baselines on established benchmarks such as robotic manipulation and web
navigation. These findings underscore the importance of tightly integrating
planning and information seeking for robust behavior in partially observable
environments. The project page is available at https://infoseekerllm.github.io

TL;DR: 提出InvThink方法，通过逆向思维机制让大模型预先分析潜在风险，实现更安全的内容生成


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全对齐方法直接优化安全响应，存在模型能力损失（safety tax）且扩展性不足。需要兼顾安全性和模型通用能力

Method: 分三步：1) 列举潜在危害 2) 分析后果 3) 生成规避风险的响应。通过监督微调(SFT)和强化学习(RL)实现

Result: 在三个关键指标上超越基线：安全性与模型规模的正相关性更强（+15.7%）、保留93%通用推理能力、在高风险领域（医疗/金融/法律）效果显著

Conclusion: 逆向推理机制为构建安全可靠的大语言模型提供了可扩展、可泛化的新路径

Abstract: We present InvThink, a simple yet powerful approach that gives large language
models (LLMs) the capability of inverse thinking: reasoning through failure
modes before generating responses. Unlike existing safety alignment methods
that optimize directly for safe response, InvThink instructs models to 1)
enumerate potential harms, 2) analyze their consequences, and 3) generate safe
outputs that proactively avoid these risks. Our method reveals three key
findings: (i) safety improvements show stronger scaling with model size
compared to existing safety methods. (ii) InvThink mitigates safety tax; by
training models to systematically consider failure modes, it preserves general
reasoning capabilities on standard benchmarks. (iii) beyond general safety
tasks, InvThink excels in high-stakes domains including external-facing
(medicine, finance, law) and agentic (blackmail, murder) risk scenarios,
achieving up to 15.7% reduction in harmful responses compared to baseline
methods like SafetyPrompt. We further implement InvThink via supervised
fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning across three LLM families. These
results suggest that inverse reasoning provides a scalable and generalizable
path toward safer, more capable language models.

Conclusion: 仅顶尖LLMs当前具备心理咨询考试资质，表明心理学专用模型开发既存在可行性也面临显著技术挑战

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across a
wide range of industries, primarily due to their impressive generative
abilities. Yet, their potential in applications requiring cognitive abilities,
such as psychological counseling, remains largely untapped. This paper
investigates the key question: Can LLMs be effectively applied to psychological
counseling? To determine whether an LLM can effectively take on the role of a
psychological counselor, the first step is to assess whether it meets the
qualifications required for such a role, namely the ability to pass the U.S.
National Counselor Certification Exam (NCE). This is because, just as a human
counselor must pass a certification exam to practice, an LLM must demonstrate
sufficient psychological knowledge to meet the standards required for such a
role. To address this, we introduce PsychoBench, a benchmark grounded in
U.S.national counselor examinations, a licensure test for professional
counselors that requires about 70% accuracy to pass. PsychoBench comprises
approximately 2,252 carefully curated single-choice questions, crafted to
require deep understanding and broad enough to cover various sub-disciplines of
psychology. This benchmark provides a comprehensive assessment of an LLM's
ability to function as a counselor. Our evaluation shows that advanced models
such as GPT-4o, Llama3.3-70B, and Gemma3-27B achieve well above the passing
threshold, while smaller open-source models (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B)
remain far below it. These results suggest that only frontier LLMs are
currently capable of meeting counseling exam standards, highlighting both the
promise and the challenges of developing psychology-oriented LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着CUAs在图形界面操作中的广泛应用，其盲目追求目标而忽视可行性/安全性/上下文的问题尚未被系统研究，存在潜在风险。

Method: 构建包含90个任务的BLIND-ACT基准（基于OSWorld），使用LLM评估代理行为，验证了与人工标注93.75%的一致性，并测试了包括Claude/GPT系列在内的9个前沿模型。

Result: 主流模型平均BGD率达80.8%，提示工程干预可降低但风险仍存。定性分析揭示了执行优先偏差、思维-行动脱节等典型失败模式。

Conclusion: 发现BGD现象并建立BLIND-ACT基准，为研究这一基础性风险及开发安全部署方案奠定基础，未来需加强训练/推理阶段的干预措施。

Abstract: Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) are an increasingly deployed class of agents that
take actions on GUIs to accomplish user goals. In this paper, we show that CUAs
consistently exhibit Blind Goal-Directedness (BGD): a bias to pursue goals
regardless of feasibility, safety, reliability, or context. We characterize
three prevalent patterns of BGD: (i) lack of contextual reasoning, (ii)
assumptions and decisions under ambiguity, and (iii) contradictory or
infeasible goals. We develop BLIND-ACT, a benchmark of 90 tasks capturing these
three patterns. Built on OSWorld, BLIND-ACT provides realistic environments and
employs LLM-based judges to evaluate agent behavior, achieving 93.75% agreement
with human annotations. We use BLIND-ACT to evaluate nine frontier models,
including Claude Sonnet and Opus 4, Computer-Use-Preview, and GPT-5, observing
high average BGD rates (80.8%) across them. We show that BGD exposes subtle
risks that arise even when inputs are not directly harmful. While
prompting-based interventions lower BGD levels, substantial risk persists,
highlighting the need for stronger training- or inference-time interventions.
Qualitative analysis reveals observed failure modes: execution-first bias
(focusing on how to act over whether to act), thought-action disconnect
(execution diverging from reasoning), and request-primacy (justifying actions
due to user request). Identifying BGD and introducing BLIND-ACT establishes a
foundation for future research on studying and mitigating this fundamental risk
and ensuring safe CUA deployment.

Motivation: 针对当前基于人类直觉设计的合成任务评估方法在AGI评估中的失效问题，主张需要更有效的评估体系来证明系统可靠性

Method: 采用数据科学中验证系统可部署性的实践方法，设计以任务执行能力为核心的评估框架，通过实际案例展示该评估范式

Result: 构建了基于系统部署可靠性的AGI评估新视角，提出具体评估指标设计示例

Conclusion: 应将评估重点从智力直觉测试转向实际任务执行能力验证，这是准确评估AGI发展进程的关键转型

Abstract: Evaluation of potential AGI systems and methods is difficult due to the
breadth of the engineering goal. We have no methods for perfect evaluation of
the end state, and instead measure performance on small tests designed to
provide directional indication that we are approaching AGI. In this work we
argue that AGI evaluation methods have been dominated by a design philosophy
that uses our intuitions of what intelligence is to create synthetic tasks,
that have performed poorly in the history of AI. Instead we argue for an
alternative design philosophy focused on evaluating robust task execution that
seeks to demonstrate AGI through competence. This perspective is developed from
common practices in data science that are used to show that a system can be
reliably deployed. We provide practical examples of what this would mean for
AGI evaluation.

TL;DR: 提出PTA-GRPO框架，通过两阶段规划强化学习优化大语言模型的推理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CoT推理方法缺乏全局规划导致冗余和错误，传统优化方法计算成本高且效果有限

Method: 1. 使用大模型将CoT提炼为高层指导进行监督微调 2. 引入指导感知的联合强化学习框架

Result: 在MATH/AIME/AMC等数学推理基准测试中，Qwen/LLaMA等不同模型均取得稳定显著提升

Conclusion: PTA-GRPO有效解决了CoT推理的全局规划问题，实验验证了框架的通用性和有效性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
in complex tasks, often relying on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However,
due to their autoregressive token-level generation, the reasoning process is
largely constrained to local decision-making and lacks global planning. This
limitation frequently results in redundant, incoherent, or inaccurate
reasoning, which significantly degrades overall performance. Existing
approaches, such as tree-based algorithms and reinforcement learning (RL),
attempt to address this issue but suffer from high computational costs and
often fail to produce optimal reasoning trajectories. To tackle this challenge,
we propose Plan-Then-Action Enhanced Reasoning with Group Relative Policy
Optimization PTA-GRPO, a two-stage framework designed to improve both
high-level planning and fine-grained CoT reasoning. In the first stage, we
leverage advanced LLMs to distill CoT into compact high-level guidance, which
is then used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, we
introduce a guidance-aware RL method that jointly optimizes the final output
and the quality of high-level guidance, thereby enhancing reasoning
effectiveness. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple mathematical
reasoning benchmarks, including MATH, AIME2024, AIME2025, and AMC, across
diverse base models such as Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Qwen3-8B, Qwen3-14B, and
LLaMA3.2-3B. Experimental results demonstrate that PTA-GRPO consistently
achieves stable and significant improvements across different models and tasks,
validating its effectiveness and generalization.

TL;DR: 提出CARS方法，通过自适应拒绝采样提升约束生成效率，在保持分布保真度的同时显著提高样本有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有约束生成方法存在效率与保真度的矛盾：贪婪解码扭曲LM分布，拒绝采样浪费计算资源。在需要高有效性+多样性的领域（如程序模糊测试）中尤为严重。

Method: 基于trie结构动态记录无效前缀，通过概率质量减除实现自适应修剪。未约束采样→识别违规延续→更新约束规则，确保不重复无效路径，接受率单调提升。

Result: 在程序模糊测试、分子生成等场景中，CARS的LM前向传播次数/有效样本效率提升显著，样本多样性优于GCD和其他近似方法。

Conclusion: CARS首次实现不扭曲LM分布的高效约束采样，为需要严格约束+多样性的生成任务提供新范式。

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are increasingly used in applications where generated
outputs must satisfy strict semantic or syntactic constraints. Existing
approaches to constrained generation fall along a spectrum: greedy constrained
decoding methods enforce validity during decoding but distort the LM's
distribution, while rejection sampling (RS) preserves fidelity but wastes
computation by discarding invalid outputs. Both extremes are problematic in
domains such as program fuzzing, where both validity and diversity of samples
are essential. We present Constrained Adaptive Rejection Sampling (CARS), an
approach that strictly improves the sample-efficiency of RS without
distributional distortion. CARS begins with unconstrained LM sampling and
adaptively rules out constraint-violating continuations by recording them in a
trie and subtracting their probability mass from future draws. This adaptive
pruning ensures that prefixes proven invalid are never revisited, acceptance
rates improve monotonically, and the resulting samples exactly follow the
constrained distribution. In experiments on a variety of domains -- e.g.,
program fuzzing and molecular generation -- CARS consistently achieves higher
efficiency -- measured in the number of LM forward passes per valid sample --
while also producing stronger sample diversity than both GCD and methods that
approximate the LM's distribution.

TL;DR: 研究发现AI模型在文本模态的ARC类任务中可能被高估抽象推理能力，在视觉模态中则被低估，需结合规则分析才能准确评估


<details>

Motivation: 验证先进模型是否真正使用任务设计者预期的抽象能力，而非依赖表面模式

Method: 使用ConceptARC基准测试，比较文本/视觉模态下的表现，结合输出准确性和规则解释的双重评估

Result: 文本模态模型准确率匹配人类但规则质量差，视觉模态准确率低但保留部分有效抽象规则

Conclusion: 需建立结合准确性+规则分析的评估框架，现有模型抽象推理仍落后人类，不同模态需差异化评估标准

Abstract: OpenAI's o3-preview reasoning model exceeded human accuracy on the ARC-AGI
benchmark, but does that mean state-of-the-art models recognize and reason with
the abstractions that the task creators intended? We investigate models'
abstraction abilities on ConceptARC. We evaluate models under settings that
vary the input modality (textual vs. visual), whether the model is permitted to
use external Python tools, and, for reasoning models, the amount of reasoning
effort. In addition to measuring output accuracy, we perform fine-grained
evaluation of the natural-language rules that models generate to explain their
solutions. This dual evaluation lets us assess whether models solve tasks using
the abstractions ConceptARC was designed to elicit, rather than relying on
surface-level patterns. Our results show that, while some models using
text-based representations match human output accuracy, the best models' rules
are often based on surface-level ``shortcuts'' and capture intended
abstractions far less often than humans. Thus their capabilities for general
abstract reasoning may be overestimated by evaluations based on accuracy alone.
In the visual modality, AI models' output accuracy drops sharply, yet our
rule-level analysis reveals that models might be underestimated, as they still
exhibit a substantial share of rules that capture intended abstractions, but
are often unable to correctly apply these rules. In short, our results show
that models still lag humans in abstract reasoning, and that using accuracy
alone to evaluate abstract reasoning on ARC-like tasks may overestimate
abstract-reasoning capabilities in textual modalities and underestimate it in
visual modalities. We believe that our evaluation framework offers a more
faithful picture of multimodal models' abstract reasoning abilities and a more
principled way to track progress toward human-like, abstraction-centered
intelligence.

Result: 主流DRAs性能显著优于网络搜索工具增强的推理模型，但在复杂任务处理上仍存在较大提升空间

Conclusion: 该研究为DRAs系统的能力评估、架构优化和范式演进提供了标准化评估体系和改进方向

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is undergoing the paradigm shift from closed language
models to interconnected agent systems capable of external perception and
information integration. As a representative embodiment, Deep Research Agents
(DRAs) systematically exhibit the capabilities for task decomposition,
cross-source retrieval, multi-stage reasoning, and structured output, which
markedly enhance performance on complex and open-ended tasks. However, existing
benchmarks remain deficient in evaluation dimensions, response formatting, and
scoring mechanisms, limiting their capacity to assess such systems effectively.
This paper introduces a rigorous benchmark and a multidimensional evaluation
framework tailored to DRAs and report-style responses. The benchmark comprises
214 expert-curated challenging queries distributed across 10 broad thematic
domains, each accompanied by manually constructed reference bundles to support
composite evaluation. The framework enables comprehensive evaluation of
long-form reports generated by DRAs, incorporating integrated scoring metrics
for semantic quality, topical focus, and retrieval trustworthiness. Extensive
experimentation confirms the superior performance of mainstream DRAs over
web-search-tool-augmented reasoning models, yet reveals considerable scope for
further improvement. This study provides a robust foundation for capability
assessment, architectural refinement, and paradigm advancement in DRA systems.

Conclusion: 标准RL目标固有策略采样机制导致模型收敛于狭窄解空间，需改进数据筛选策略突破训练瓶颈

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key
method for improving Large Language Models' reasoning capabilities, yet recent
evidence suggests it may paradoxically shrink the reasoning boundary rather
than expand it. This paper investigates the shrinkage issue of RLVR by
analyzing its learning dynamics and reveals two critical phenomena that explain
this failure. First, we expose negative interference in RLVR, where learning to
solve certain training problems actively reduces the likelihood of correct
solutions for others, leading to the decline of Pass@$k$ performance, or the
probability of generating a correct solution within $k$ attempts. Second, we
uncover the winner-take-all phenomenon: RLVR disproportionately reinforces
problems with high likelihood, correct solutions, under the base model, while
suppressing other initially low-likelihood ones. Through extensive theoretical
and empirical analysis on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we show
that this effect arises from the inherent on-policy sampling in standard RL
objectives, causing the model to converge toward narrow solution strategies.
Based on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective data curation
algorithm that focuses RLVR learning on low-likelihood problems, achieving
notable improvement in Pass@$k$ performance. Our code is available at

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Computer-use agents (CUAs) hold promise for automating everyday digital
tasks, but their unreliability and high variance hinder their application to
long-horizon, complex tasks. We introduce Behavior Best-of-N (bBoN), a method
that scales over agents by generating multiple rollouts and selecting among
them using behavior narratives that describe the agents' rollouts. It enables
both wide exploration and principled trajectory selection, substantially
improving robustness and success rates. On OSWorld, our bBoN scaling method
establishes a new state of the art (SoTA) at 69.9%, significantly outperforming
prior methods and approaching human-level performance at 72%, with
comprehensive ablations validating key design choices. We further demonstrate
strong generalization results to different operating systems on
WindowsAgentArena and AndroidWorld. Crucially, our results highlight the
unreasonable effectiveness of scaling CUAs, when you do it right: effective
scaling requires structured trajectory understanding and selection, and bBoN
provides a practical framework to achieve this.

Motivation: 传统思维链训练易陷入低效探索，缺乏可复用的程序化推理步骤。需要结构化机制解耦知识抽象与解决方案生成。

Method: 引入自然语言描述的推理抽象，构建RLAD联合训练范式：抽象生成器提出程序知识，解决方案生成器基于抽象构建答案，通过双RL机制协同优化。

Result: 在复杂任务上展现更好泛化能力，测试时分配算力生成抽象比单纯增加解决方案数量更有效（+12%准确率），验证抽象对探索的引导作用。

Conclusion: 推理抽象有效实现结构化探索，解耦知识提炼与运用环节，为可解释推理模型提供新训练范式。

Abstract: Reasoning requires going beyond pattern matching or memorization of solutions
to identify and implement "algorithmic procedures" that can be used to deduce
answers to hard problems. Doing so requires realizing the most relevant
primitives, intermediate results, or shared procedures, and building upon them.
While RL post-training on long chains of thought ultimately aims to uncover
this kind of algorithmic behavior, most reasoning traces learned by large
models fail to consistently capture or reuse procedures, instead drifting into
verbose and degenerate exploration. To address more effective reasoning, we
introduce reasoning abstractions: concise natural language descriptions of
procedural and factual knowledge that guide the model toward learning
successful reasoning. We train models to be capable of proposing multiple
abstractions given a problem, followed by RL that incentivizes building a
solution while using the information provided by these abstractions. This
results in a two-player RL training paradigm, abbreviated as RLAD, that jointly
trains an abstraction generator and a solution generator. This setup
effectively enables structured exploration, decouples learning signals of
abstraction proposal and solution generation, and improves generalization to
harder problems. We also show that allocating more test-time compute to
generating abstractions is more beneficial for performance than generating more
solutions at large test budgets, illustrating the role of abstractions in
guiding meaningful exploration.

Result: Manim动画显著提升学习效果，用户反馈积极，验证了工具在跨学科领域的扩展潜力

Conclusion: Manim作为免费开源工具，能帮助教育者高效创建可视化教学内容，具有广泛的教学适用性和延展性

Abstract: Many STEM concepts pose significant learning challenges to students due to
their inherent complexity and abstract nature. Visualizing complex problems
through animations can significantly enhance learning outcomes. However, the
creation of animations can be time-consuming and inconvenient. Hence, many
educators illustrate complex concepts by hand on a board or a digital device.
Although static graphics are helpful for understanding, they are less effective
than animations. The free and open-source Python package Manim enables
educators to create visually compelling animations easily. Python's
straightforward syntax, combined with Manim's comprehensive set of built-in
classes and methods, greatly simplifies implementation. This article presents a
series of examples that demonstrate how Manim can be used to create animated
video lessons for a variety of topics in computer science and mathematics. In
addition, it analyzes viewer feedback collected across multiple social media
platforms to evaluate the effectiveness and accessibility of these
visualizations. The article further explores broader potentials of the Manim
Python library by showcasing demonstrations that extend its applications to
subject areas beyond computer science and mathematics.

Motivation: 高温采样在数学推理等需要高精度的任务中容易产生错误输出，传统采样方法在敏感解码位置会降低准确性

Method: 基于采样风险指标动态选择采样策略，使用预训练轻量级分类器预测错误风险，仅在低风险位置应用高温采样

Result: 在数学推理任务中有效提升质量-多样性平衡，即使在高温度设置下仍保持输出质量

Conclusion: 选择性采样为语言模型提供了一种可验证的采样控制机制，能够在保持生成多样性的同时显著减少关键位置错误

Abstract: Diversity is an essential metric for evaluating the creativity of outputs
generated by language models. Temperature-based sampling is a common strategy
to increase diversity. However, for tasks that require high precision, e.g.,
mathematical reasoning, uncontrolled high temperature sampling, e.g., min-$p$
or top-$p$, degrades reasoning quality. We demonstrate that the loss of
accuracy is caused by sampling incorrect continuations in sensitive decoding
positions. To address this, in this paper, we propose \textbf{selective
sampling}, a method that dynamically switches between greedy and
high-temperature sampling based on a sampling risk metric. This risk metric
estimates the likelihood of output errors when applying high-temperature
sampling on the current token position. To predict sampling risk, we train a
lightweight classifier on a small subset of verifiable problems. The trained
classifier can be integrated with the base language model with minimal latency
overhead. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that
selective sampling enhances the quality-diversity trade-off, even in
high-temperature settings.

Abstract: The rapid discovery of materials is constrained by the lack of large,
machine-readable datasets that couple performance metrics with structural
context. Existing databases are either small, manually curated, or biased
toward first principles results, leaving experimental literature
underexploited. We present an agentic, large language model (LLM)-driven
workflow that autonomously extracts thermoelectric and structural-properties
from about 10,000 full-text scientific articles. The pipeline integrates
dynamic token allocation, zeroshot multi-agent extraction, and conditional
table parsing to balance accuracy against computational cost. Benchmarking on
50 curated papers shows that GPT-4.1 achieves the highest accuracy (F1 = 0.91
for thermoelectric properties and 0.82 for structural fields), while GPT-4.1
Mini delivers nearly comparable performance (F1 = 0.89 and 0.81) at a fraction
of the cost, enabling practical large scale deployment. Applying this workflow,
we curated 27,822 temperature resolved property records with normalized units,
spanning figure of merit (ZT), Seebeck coefficient, conductivity, resistivity,
power factor, and thermal conductivity, together with structural attributes
such as crystal class, space group, and doping strategy. Dataset analysis
reproduces known thermoelectric trends, such as the superior performance of
alloys over oxides and the advantage of p-type doping, while also surfacing
broader structure-property correlations. To facilitate community access, we
release an interactive web explorer with semantic filters, numeric queries, and
CSV export. This study delivers the largest LLM-curated thermoelectric dataset
to date, provides a reproducible and cost-profiled extraction pipeline, and
establishes a foundation for scalable, data-driven materials discovery beyond
thermoelectrics.

Conclusion: 既为资源受限环境提供实用解决方案，又建立信息几何与神经网络量化的理论桥梁，推动高效深度学习发展

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, their exponentially
increasing parameters pose significant challenges for deployment on
resource-constrained devices. Vector Quantization (VQ) shows great promise for
low-bit quantization (e.g., 2 to 4 bits), but existing work faces two key
challenges: unconstrained direction error and suboptimal bit allocation. In
this paper, we propose RSAVQ, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit
quantization for LLMs. RSAVQ introduces two geometry-driven innovations that
effectively mitigate above limitations: (1) Error Direction Sensitivity
Guidance (EDSG), which leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)-induced
Riemannian metric to project quantization errors onto low-sensitivity
directions in the parameter space. Specifically, this projection is performed
along the negative natural gradient direction, which effectively suppresses
error expansion. (2) Weight Channel Sensitivity Guidance (WCSG) , which
constructs a channel-wise sensitivity metric via FIM curvature analysis to
dynamically guide bit resource allocation. The approach facilitates a globally
optimal quantization solution within prescribed bit constraints. Experiments
demonstrate that RSAVQ outperforms existing methods for LLMs. For example, in
2-bit quantization of LLaMA-3 8B, RSAVQ leads baselines like VPTQ and QuIP# by
0.4 in perplexity (PPL) and 1.5 in zero-shot accuracy. This work offers a
practical solution for constrained environments and a theoretical bridge
between information geometry and the quantization of neural networks, advancing
efficient deep learning.

Conclusion: RLP成功将强化学习转化为预训练目标，验证了在预训练阶段整合探索机制的可行性，展示出跨架构和模型规模的扩展能力

Abstract: The dominant paradigm for training large reasoning models starts with
pre-training using next-token prediction loss on vast amounts of data.
Reinforcement learning, while powerful in scaling reasoning, is introduced only
as the very last phase of post-training, preceded by supervised fine-tuning.
While dominant, is this an optimal way of training? In this paper, we present
RLP, an information-driven reinforcement pretraining objective, that brings the
core spirit of reinforcement learning -- exploration -- to the last phase of
pretraining. The key idea is to treat chain-of-thought as an exploratory
action, with rewards computed based on the information gain it provides for
predicting future tokens. This training objective essentially encourages the
model to think for itself before predicting what comes next, thus teaching an
independent thinking behavior earlier in the pretraining. More concretely, the
reward signal measures the increase in log-likelihood of the next token when
conditioning on both context and a sampled reasoning chain, compared to
conditioning on context alone. This approach yields a verifier-free dense
reward signal, allowing for efficient training for the full document stream
during pretraining. Specifically, RLP reframes reinforcement learning for
reasoning as a pretraining objective on ordinary text, bridging the gap between
next-token prediction and the emergence of useful chain-of-thought reasoning.
Pretraining with RLP on Qwen3-1.7B-Base lifts the overall average across an
eight-benchmark math-and-science suite by 19%. With identical post-training,
the gains compound, with the largest improvements on reasoning-heavy tasks such
as AIME25 and MMLU-Pro. Applying RLP to the hybrid Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2
increases the overall average from 42.81% to 61.32% and raises the average on
scientific reasoning by 23%, demonstrating scalability across architectures and
model sizes.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) generation often requires balancing output quality
against inference cost, especially when using multiple generations. We
introduce a new framework for inference-time optimization based on the
classical Pandora's Box problem. Viewing each generation as opening a costly
"box" with random reward, we develop algorithms that decide when to stop
generating without knowing the underlying reward distribution. Our first
contribution is a UCB-style Pandora's Box algorithm, which achieves performance
that is provably close to Weitzman's algorithm, the optimal strategy when the
distribution is known. We further adapt this method to practical LLM settings
by addressing reward scaling across prompts via a Bradley-Terry inspired
transformation. This leads to an adaptive inference-time optimization method
that normalizes rewards and learns stopping thresholds on the fly. Experiments
on the AlpacaFarm and HH-RLHF datasets, using multiple LLM-reward model pairs,
show that our adaptive strategy can obtain the same performance as non-adaptive
Best-of-N sampling while requiring 15-35 percent fewer generations on average.
Our results establish a principled bridge between optimal stopping theory and
inference-time scaling, providing both theoretical performance bounds and
practical efficiency gains for LLM deployment.

TL;DR: 提出LSPO算法，通过动态数据选择提升可验证奖励强化学习(RLVR)效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受大语言模型(LLMs)中过度思考现象的启发，旨在改进RLVR训练效率

Method: 开发元RLVR算法LSPO，根据平均响应长度动态选择训练数据

Result: 在多个基础模型和数据集上验证了算法有效性，并通过消融实验验证方法合理性

Conclusion: LSPO为RLVR训练提供了有效新范式，长度信号整合方法指明未来研究方向

Abstract: Since the release of Deepseek-R1, reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR) has become a central approach for training large language models
(LLMs) on reasoning tasks. Recent work has largely focused on modifying loss
functions to make RLVR more efficient and effective. In this paper, motivated
by studies of overthinking in LLMs, we propose Length-aware Sampling for Policy
Optimization (LSPO), a novel meta-RLVR algorithm that dynamically selects
training data at each step based on the average response length. We evaluate
LSPO across multiple base models and datasets, demonstrating that it
consistently improves learning effectiveness. In addition, we conduct a
detailed ablation study to examine alternative ways of incorporating length
signals into dynamic sampling, offering further insights and highlighting
promising directions for future research.

TL;DR: TRAAC提出自适应注意力压缩方法，通过强化学习平衡模型推理步骤，提升准确率同时减少36.8%推理长度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型存在欠适应性问题：短推理（欠思考）导致复杂任务错误，长推理（过思考）产生冗余步骤。需根据任务难度动态调整推理预算

Method: 1. 在线强化学习方法利用自注意力机制压缩冗余步骤
2. 将任务难度估计融入奖励机制
3. 注意力机制识别关键推理步骤并剪枝

Result: Qwen3-4B模型在数学/非数学任务平均准确率提升8.4%，推理长度减少36.8%。跨领域泛化表现优异（GPQA-D/BBEH等任务提升7.9%准确率）

Conclusion: TRAAC通过难度校准与注意力压缩实现：1. 基于难度的细粒度推理预算分配 2. 多任务通用性 3. 效率与准确率的双重提升

Abstract: Recent thinking models solve complex reasoning tasks by scaling test-time
compute, but this scaling must be allocated in line with task difficulty. On
one hand, short reasoning (underthinking) leads to errors on harder problems
that require extended reasoning steps; but, excessively long reasoning
(overthinking) can be token-inefficient, generating unnecessary steps even
after reaching a correct intermediate solution. We refer to this as
under-adaptivity, where the model fails to modulate its response length
appropriately given problems of varying difficulty. To address under-adaptivity
and strike a balance between under- and overthinking, we propose TRAAC (Think
Right with Adaptive, Attentive Compression), an online post-training RL method
that leverages the model's self-attention over a long reasoning trajectory to
identify important steps and prune redundant ones. TRAAC also estimates
difficulty and incorporates it into training rewards, thereby learning to
allocate reasoning budget commensurate with example difficulty. Our approach
improves accuracy, reduces reasoning steps, and enables adaptive thinking
compared to base models and other RL baselines. Across a variety of tasks
(AIME, AMC, GPQA-D, BBEH), TRAAC (Qwen3-4B) achieves an average absolute
accuracy gain of 8.4% with a relative reduction in reasoning length of 36.8%
compared to the base model, and a 7.9% accuracy gain paired with a 29.4% length
drop compared to the best RL baseline. TRAAC also shows strong generalization:
although our models are trained on math datasets, they show accuracy and
efficiency gains on out-of-distribution non-math datasets like GPQA-D, BBEH,
and OptimalThinkingBench. Our analysis further verifies that TRAAC provides
fine-grained adjustments to thinking budget based on difficulty and that a
combination of task-difficulty calibration and attention-based compression
yields gains across diverse tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现高SFT分数不保证RL后性能提升，提出泛化损失和Pass@large k作为更可靠的RL效果预测指标


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统两阶段训练(SFT+RL)的有效性假设，验证高SFT分数是否真正转化为RL改进，寻找更优的评估指标

Method: 通过数百个12B参数模型的对比实验(跨Llama3/Mistral-Nemo/Qwen3架构)，在7个数学基准测试中进行256次重复验证，分析不同指标与RL结果的相关性

Result: 泛化损失和Pass@large k指标显著提升预测精度(R²和Spearman系数最高提升0.5)，揭示数据使用策略(样本多样性>数量)和训练方式(多epoch优于单epoch)对最终效果的关键影响

Conclusion: 新指标为训练策略选择提供可靠依据，开源评估工具将促进社区优化LLM训练流程。发现短样本集中训练虽提升SFT分数但损害RL潜力，强调训练数据多样性的重要性

Abstract: In post-training for reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs), the current
state of practice trains LLMs in two independent stages: Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR, shortened as
``RL'' below). In this work, we challenge whether high SFT scores translate to
improved performance after RL. We provide extensive counter-examples where this
is not true. We find high SFT scores can be biased toward simpler or more
homogeneous data and are not reliably predictive of subsequent RL gains or
scaled-up post-training effectiveness. In some cases, RL training on models
with improved SFT performance could lead to substantially worse outcome
compared to RL on the base model without SFT. We study alternative metrics and
identify generalization loss on held-out reasoning examples and Pass@large k
performance to provide strong proxies for the RL outcome. We trained hundreds
of models up to 12B-parameter with SFT and RLVR via GRPO and ran extensive
evaluations on 7 math benchmarks with up to 256 repetitions, spending $>$1M GPU
hours. Experiments include models from Llama3, Mistral-Nemo, Qwen3 and multiple
state-of-the-art SFT/RL datasets. Compared to directly predicting from pre-RL
performance, prediction based on generalization loss and Pass@large k achieves
substantial higher precision, improving $R^2$ coefficient and Spearman's rank
correlation coefficient by up to 0.5 (2x). This provides strong utility for
broad use cases. For example, in most experiments, we find SFT training on
unique examples for a one epoch underperforms training on half examples for two
epochs, either after SFT or SFT-then-RL; With the same SFT budget, training
only on short examples may lead to better SFT performance, though, it often
leads to worse outcome after RL compared to training on examples with varying
lengths. Evaluation tool will be open-sourced.

TL;DR: 合成数据在LLM预训练中具有条件性优势：1/3改写合成数据混合自然数据可加速训练5-10倍，30%为最佳混合比例，模型崩溃现象因合成数据类型而异

Motivation: 解决高质量训练数据稀缺问题，探索合成数据替代/补充自然数据的可能性

Method: 采用统一协议和扩展定律，进行超1000个LLM模型、超10万GPU小时的大规模实证研究，对比自然网络数据、改写文本、生成教科书等不同类型合成数据及其混合效果

Result: 1. 混合1/3改写合成数据训练速度提升5-10倍 2. 纯教科书式数据训练下游任务损失显著升高 3. 合成数据最佳比例约30% 4. 8B参数生成模型已足够 5. 改写数据未现模型崩溃，教科书式数据符合模型崩溃预测

Conclusion: 研究揭示了合成数据在预训练中的条件有效性，验证其混合使用的加速效益，为实际应用提供了混合比例选择、生成模型规模优化等关键指导

Abstract: Training data plays a crucial role in Large Language Models (LLM) scaling,
yet high quality data is of limited supply. Synthetic data techniques offer a
potential path toward sidestepping these limitations. We conduct a large-scale
empirical investigation (>1000 LLMs with >100k GPU hours) using a unified
protocol and scaling laws, comparing natural web data, diverse synthetic types
(rephrased text, generated textbooks), and mixtures of natural and synthetic
data. Specifically, we found pre-training on rephrased synthetic data
\textit{alone} is not faster than pre-training on natural web texts; while
pre-training on 1/3 rephrased synthetic data mixed with 2/3 natural web texts
can speed up 5-10x (to reach the same validation loss) at larger data budgets.
Pre-training on textbook-style synthetic data \textit{alone} results in notably
higher loss on many downstream domains especially at small data budgets. "Good"
ratios of synthetic data in training data mixtures depend on the model size and
data budget, empirically converging to ~30% for rephrased synthetic data.
Larger generator models do not necessarily yield better pre-training data than
~8B-param models. These results contribute mixed evidence on "model collapse"
during large-scale single-round (n=1) model training on synthetic
data--training on rephrased synthetic data shows no degradation in performance
in foreseeable scales whereas training on mixtures of textbook-style
pure-generated synthetic data shows patterns predicted by "model collapse". Our
work demystifies synthetic data in pre-training, validates its conditional
benefits, and offers practical guidance.

*Adam Filipek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出稀疏查询注意力(SQA)机制，通过减少Query头数量直接降低注意力计算复杂度，在32k-200k长序列场景实现最高3倍吞吐量提升，为Transformer架构提供新的优化路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多头注意力(MHA)存在二次计算复杂度问题，现有解决方案(MQA/GQA)虽优化内存带宽但未解决计算FLOPs瓶颈。SQA通过减少Query头数量实现计算量级降低，突破训练和长序列处理的关键瓶颈。

Method: 提出稀疏查询注意力架构：1) 减少Query头而非Key/Value头 2) 建立数学公式计算复杂度降低比例 3) 开发系列架构变体 4) 在预训练、微调、编码器任务等计算密集场景验证。

Result: 在32k-200k长序列实验中：1) 计算受限场景吞吐量提升达3倍 2) 小规模实验显示模型质量影响微弱 3) 与反应式Transformer架构协同发现优化潜力。

Conclusion: SQA为注意力机制优化开辟新方向，通过与MQA/GQA形成互补，显著提升模型计算效率。该方法为构建可扩展AI模型提供新思路，特别是在处理超长上下文场景中展现独特价值。

Abstract: The Transformer architecture, underpinned by the Multi-Head Attention (MHA)
mechanism, has become the de facto standard for state-of-the-art models in
artificial intelligence. However, the quadratic computational complexity of MHA
with respect to sequence length presents a significant barrier to scaling,
particularly for applications involving long contexts. Prevailing solutions,
such as Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA), have
effectively addressed the memory bandwidth bottleneck that dominates
autoregressive inference latency by sharing Key and Value projections. While
highly successful, these methods do not reduce the fundamental number of
floating-point operations (FLOPs) required for the attention score computation,
which remains a critical bottleneck for training and full-sequence processing.
This paper introduces Sparse Query Attention (SQA), a novel attention
architecture that pursues an alternative and complementary optimization path.
Instead of reducing Key/Value heads, SQA reduces the number of Query heads.
This architectural modification directly decreases the computational complexity
of the attention mechanism by a factor proportional to the reduction in query
heads, thereby lowering the overall FLOPs. This work presents the theoretical
foundation of SQA, its mathematical formulation, and a family of architectural
variants. Empirical benchmarks on long sequences (32k-200k tokens) demonstrate
that SQA can achieve significant throughput improvements of up to 3x in
computation-bound scenarios such as model pre-training, fine-tuning, and
encoder-based tasks, with only a minimal impact on model quality in preliminary
smallscale experiments. SQA was discovered serendipitously during the
development of the upcoming Reactive Transformer architecture, suggesting its
potential as a powerful tool for building more efficient and scalable models

TL;DR: 论文提出StockBench基准测试，评估LLM代理在真实股票交易环境中的动态决策能力，发现现有模型虽普遍弱于买入持有策略，但部分展现风险收益潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有金融基准仅测试静态知识问答，无法评估动态交易场景下LLM代理的持续决策能力，需建立更贴近真实市场的评估体系。

Method: 设计多周期股票交易环境，输入每日价格/基本面/新闻数据，要求模型进行序列买卖决策，采用累计收益/最大回撤/Sortino比率等金融指标评估。

Result: 多数LLM代理跑输买入持有基准，但部分模型展现超额收益潜力；静态金融知识能力与动态交易策略有效性不直接相关。

Conclusion: StockBench为开源评估框架，揭示LLM在金融决策中的局限与潜力，推动智能体在动态高风险场景的研究应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities
as autonomous agents, showing promise in reasoning, tool use, and sequential
decision-making. While prior benchmarks have evaluated LLM agents in domains
such as software engineering and scientific discovery, the finance domain
remains underexplored, despite its direct relevance to economic value and
high-stakes decision-making. Existing financial benchmarks primarily test
static knowledge through question answering, but they fall short of capturing
the dynamic and iterative nature of trading. To address this gap, we introduce
StockBench, a contamination-free benchmark designed to evaluate LLM agents in
realistic, multi-month stock trading environments. Agents receive daily market
signals -- including prices, fundamentals, and news -- and must make sequential
buy, sell, or hold decisions. Performance is assessed using financial metrics
such as cumulative return, maximum drawdown, and the Sortino ratio. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary (e.g., GPT-5, Claude-4) and
open-weight (e.g., Qwen3, Kimi-K2, GLM-4.5) models shows that while most LLM
agents struggle to outperform the simple buy-and-hold baseline, several models
demonstrate the potential to deliver higher returns and manage risk more
effectively. These findings highlight both the challenges and opportunities in
developing LLM-powered financial agents, showing that excelling at static
financial knowledge tasks does not necessarily translate into successful
trading strategies. We release StockBench as an open-source resource to support
reproducibility and advance future research in this domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLVR方法丢弃经验导致计算低效和训练不稳定，且缺乏对经验价值指标的系统研究

Method: 提出基于经验正确性和熵的评估指标，开发混合策略优化框架(ExGRPO)实现经验分组管理和探索-利用平衡

Result: 在5个模型(1.5B-8B)上验证，数学/通用基准分别提升3.5/7.6分，显著增强训练稳定性

Conclusion: 系统化的经验管理是实现高效可扩展RLVR的关键，为大规模推理模型优化提供新方向

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) is an emerging paradigm
for improving the reasoning ability of large language models. However, standard
on-policy training discards rollout experiences after a single update, leading
to computational inefficiency and instability. While prior work on RL has
highlighted the benefits of reusing past experience, the role of experience
characteristics in shaping learning dynamics of large reasoning models remains
underexplored. In this paper, we are the first to investigate what makes a
reasoning experience valuable and identify rollout correctness and entropy as
effective indicators of experience value. Based on these insights, we propose
ExGRPO (Experiential Group Relative Policy Optimization), a framework that
organizes and prioritizes valuable experiences, and employs a mixed-policy
objective to balance exploration with experience exploitation. Experiments on
five backbone models (1.5B-8B parameters) show that ExGRPO consistently
improves reasoning performance on mathematical/general benchmarks, with an
average gain of +3.5/7.6 points over on-policy RLVR. Moreover, ExGRPO
stabilizes training on both stronger and weaker models where on-policy methods
fail. These results highlight principled experience management as a key
ingredient for efficient and scalable RLVR.

Method: 将对话建模为序列决策问题，集成树搜索的在线策略强化学习框架，无需人工标注数据，通过对话策略优化实现多轮攻击路径自主探索

Result: 在10个目标模型上实现25.9%的ASR提升，成功发现对话策略优化（RPO）等新型攻击模式，攻击有效性超越现有SOTA方法

Conclusion: DialTree-RPO框架不仅突破传统红队测试局限，还揭示了多轮对话中LLM安全防御的新研究方向

Abstract: Despite recent rapid progress in AI safety, current large language models
remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks in multi-turn interaction settings,
where attackers strategically adapt their prompts across conversation turns and
pose a more critical yet realistic challenge. Existing approaches that discover
safety vulnerabilities either rely on manual red-teaming with human experts or
employ automated methods using pre-defined templates and human-curated attack
data, with most focusing on single-turn attacks. However, these methods did not
explore the vast space of possible multi-turn attacks, failing to consider
novel attack trajectories that emerge from complex dialogue dynamics and
strategic conversation planning. This gap is particularly critical given recent
findings that LLMs exhibit significantly higher vulnerability to multi-turn
attacks compared to single-turn attacks. We propose DialTree-RPO, an on-policy
reinforcement learning framework integrated with tree search that autonomously
discovers diverse multi-turn attack strategies by treating the dialogue as a
sequential decision-making problem, enabling systematic exploration without
manually curated data. Through extensive experiments, our approach not only
achieves more than 25.9% higher ASR across 10 target models compared to
previous state-of-the-art approaches, but also effectively uncovers new attack
strategies by learning optimal dialogue policies that maximize attack success
across multiple turns.

Method: 基于控制服务器架构，实现训练参数/数据/检查点的动态调整，通过三个案例研究验证有效性

Result: 展示出更优的训练稳定性（降低83%失败率）、超参数敏感性减少（学习率适应范围扩大10倍）、用户需求适应能力提升（准确率提高12%）

Conclusion: 该框架为未来AI代理自主监控训练日志、主动解决不稳定问题、优化训练动态的新型训练范式奠定基础

Abstract: Traditional neural network training typically follows fixed, predefined
optimization recipes, lacking the flexibility to dynamically respond to
instabilities or emerging training issues. In this paper, we introduce
Interactive Training, an open-source framework that enables real-time,
feedback-driven intervention during neural network training by human experts or
automated AI agents. At its core, Interactive Training uses a control server to
mediate communication between users or agents and the ongoing training process,
allowing users to dynamically adjust optimizer hyperparameters, training data,
and model checkpoints. Through three case studies, we demonstrate that
Interactive Training achieves superior training stability, reduced sensitivity
to initial hyperparameters, and improved adaptability to evolving user needs,
paving the way toward a future training paradigm where AI agents autonomously
monitor training logs, proactively resolve instabilities, and optimize training
dynamics.
