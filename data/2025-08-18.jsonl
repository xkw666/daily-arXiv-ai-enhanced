However, these methods often create layouts with flaws, such as\nmisalignment, unwanted overlaps, and unsatisfied containment. To tackle this\nissue, we propose an optimization-based method called LayoutRectifier, which\ngracefully rectifies auto-generated graphic design layouts to reduce these\nflaws while minimizing deviation from the generated layout. The core of our\nmethod is a two-stage optimization. First, we utilize grid systems, which\nprofessional designers commonly use to organize elements, to mitigate\nmisalignments through discrete search. Second, we introduce a novel box\ncontainment function designed to adjust the positions and sizes of the layout\nelements, preventing unwanted overlapping and promoting desired containment. We\nevaluate our method on content-agnostic and content-aware layout generation\ntasks and achieve better-quality layouts that are more suitable for downstream\ngraphic design tasks. Our method complements learning-based layout generation\nmethods and does not require additional training."}

However, such distractors often fail to\ncapture the diverse reasoning errors of individual students, limiting their\ndiagnostic effectiveness. To address this limitation, we introduce the task of\npersonalized distractor generation, which aims to generate tailored distractors\nbased on individual misconceptions inferred from each student's past\nquestion-answering (QA) records, ensuring every student receives options that\neffectively exposes their specific reasoning errors.

We systematically examine this issue across three paradigms: (1)\nSpeciesismBench, a 1,003-item benchmark assessing recognition and moral\nevaluation of speciesist statements; (2) established psychological measures\ncomparing model responses with those of human participants; (3) text-generation\ntasks probing elaboration on, or resistance to, speciesist rationalizations. In\nour benchmark, LLMs reliably detected speciesist statements but rarely\ncondemned them, often treating speciesist attitudes as morally acceptable. On\npsychological measures, results were mixed: LLMs expressed slightly lower\nexplicit speciesism than people, yet in direct trade-offs they more often chose\nto save one human over multiple animals. A tentative interpretation is that\nLLMs may weight cognitive capacity rather than species per se: when capacities\nwere equal, they showed no species preference, and when an animal was described\nas more capable, they tended to prioritize it over a less capable human. In\nopen-ended text generation tasks, LLMs frequently normalized or rationalized\nharm toward farmed animals while refusing to do so for non-farmed animals.\nThese findings suggest that while LLMs reflect a mixture of progressive and\nmainstream human views, they nonetheless reproduce entrenched cultural norms\naround animal exploitation.

To address these issues, this paper presents a novel\ncross-modal rumor detection scheme based on contrastive learning, namely the\nMulti-scale Image and Context Correlation exploration algorithm (MICC).\nSpecifically, we design an SCLIP encoder to generate unified semantic\nembeddings for text and multi-scale image patches through contrastive\npretraining, enabling their relevance to be measured via dot-product\nsimilarity. Building upon this, a Cross-Modal Multi-Scale Alignment module is\nintroduced to identify image regions most relevant to the textual semantics,\nguided by mutual information maximization and the information bottleneck\nprinciple, through a Top-K selection strategy based on a cross-modal relevance\nmatrix constructed between the text and multi-scale image patches. Moreover, a\nscale-aware fusion network is designed to integrate the highly correlated\nmulti-scale image features with global text features by assigning adaptive\nweights to image regions based on their semantic importance and cross-modal\nrelevance. The proposed methodology has been extensively evaluated on two\nreal-world datasets.
