First, we extend the treemap layout pipeline\nto consider similarity during data preprocessing. We then use a Kuhn-Munkres\nmatching of similarities to centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT) cells to\ncreate initial Voronoi diagrams with equal cell sizes for each level. Greedy\nswapping is used to improve the neighborhoods of cells to match the data's\nsimilarity further.

For example, when interacting with a\nchatbot, malicious users can input specially crafted prompts to cause the LLM\nto generate undesirable content or perform a completely different task from its\nintended purpose. Existing mitigations for such attacks typically rely on\nhardening the LLM's system prompt or using a content classifier trained to\ndetect undesirable content or off-topic conversations. However, these\nprobabilistic approaches are relatively easy to bypass due to the very large\nspace of possible inputs and undesirable outputs. In this paper, we present and\nevaluate Highlight & Summarize (H&S), a new design pattern for\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that prevents these attacks by\ndesign. The core idea is to perform the same task as a standard RAG pipeline\n(i.e., to provide natural language answers to questions, based on relevant\nsources) without ever revealing the user's question to the generative LLM. This\nis achieved by splitting the pipeline into two components: a highlighter, which\ntakes the user's question and extracts relevant passages (\"highlights\") from\nthe retrieved documents, and a summarizer, which takes the highlighted passages\nand summarizes them into a cohesive answer. We describe several possible\ninstantiations of H&S and evaluate their generated responses in terms of\ncorrectness, relevance, and response quality. Surprisingly, when using an\nLLM-based highlighter, the majority of H&S responses are judged to be better\nthan those of a standard RAG pipeline."}

Our\nframework introduces two key innovations: (1) a knowledge construction module\nthat employs multi-source line graphs to efficiently aggregate logical\nrelationships across different knowledge sources, effectively addressing the\nsparse data distribution issue; and (2) a sophisticated retrieval module that\nimplements a multi-level confidence calculation mechanism, performing both\ngraph-level and node-level assessments to identify and eliminate unreliable\ninformation nodes, thereby reducing hallucinations caused by inter-source\ninconsistencies. Extensive experiments on four multi-domain query datasets and\ntwo multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that MultiRAG significantly enhances the\nreliability and efficiency of knowledge retrieval in complex multi-source\nscenarios. \\textcolor{blue}{Our code is available in\nhttps://github.com/wuwenlong123/MultiRAG."}

This\ncompression leads to notable performance degradation in out-of-domain,\nlong-context, and reasoning-intensive retrieval tasks. Multi-vector approaches\npioneered by ColBERT aim to address these limitations by preserving individual\ntoken embeddings and computing similarity via the MaxSim operator. This\narchitecture has demonstrated superior empirical advantages, including enhanced\nout-of-domain generalization, long-context handling, and performance in complex\nretrieval scenarios. Despite these compelling empirical results and clear\ntheoretical advantages, the practical adoption and public availability of late\ninteraction models remain low compared to their single-vector counterparts,\nprimarily due to a lack of accessible and modular tools for training and\nexperimenting with such models. To bridge this gap, we introduce PyLate, a\nstreamlined library built on top of Sentence Transformers to support\nmulti-vector architectures natively, inheriting its efficient training,\nadvanced logging, and automated model card generation while requiring minimal\ncode changes to code templates users are already familiar with. By offering\nmulti-vector-specific features such as efficient indexes, PyLate aims to\naccelerate research and real-world application of late interaction models,\nthereby unlocking their full potential in modern IR systems. Finally, PyLate\nhas already enabled the development of state-of-the-art models, including\nGTE-ModernColBERT and Reason-ModernColBERT, demonstrating its practical utility\nfor both research and production environments."}

These engaging user-generated\ncontent are characterised by their reuse of visual elements also found in other\nmemes. Matching instances of memes via these shared visual elements, called\nMeme Matching, is the basis of a wealth of meme analysis approaches. However,\nmost existing methods assume that every meme consists of a shared visual\nbackground, called a Template, with some overlaid text, thereby limiting meme\nmatching to comparing the background image alone. Current approaches exclude\nthe many memes that are not template-based and limit the effectiveness of\nautomated meme analysis and would not be effective at linking memes to\ncontemporary web-based meme dictionaries. In this work, we introduce a broader\nformulation of meme matching that extends beyond template matching. We show\nthat conventional similarity measures, including a novel segment-wise\ncomputation of the similarity measures, excel at matching template-based memes\nbut fall short when applied to non-template-based meme formats. However, the\nsegment-wise approach was found to consistently outperform the whole-image\nmeasures on matching non-template-based memes. Finally, we explore a\nprompting-based approach using a pretrained Multimodal Large Language Model for\nmeme matching. Our results highlight that accurately matching memes via shared\nvisual elements, not just background templates, remains an open challenge that\nrequires more sophisticated matching techniques."}

Significant\nfindings reveal a predominant negative sentiment influenced by war events, a\nnuanced distribution of pro-Ukrainian and pro-Russian partisanship, and the\npotential strategic manipulation of information. Additionally, we apply\ncommunity detection techniques, which are able to identify distinct clusters\npartisanship, topics, and misinformation, highlighting the complex dynamics of\ninformation spread on social media.

Homan"], "title": "Forest vs Tree: The $(N, K)$ Trade-off in Reproducible ML Evaluation", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "comment": null, "summary": "Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific validation and of the\nauthority it confers on its results. Reproducibility in machine learning\nevaluations leads to greater trust, confidence, and value. However, the ground\ntruth responses used in machine learning often necessarily come from humans,\namong whom disagreement is prevalent, and surprisingly little research has\nstudied the impact of effectively ignoring disagreement in these responses, as\nis typically the case. One reason for the lack of research is that budgets for\ncollecting human-annotated evaluation data are limited, and obtaining more\nsamples from multiple annotators for each example greatly increases the\nper-item annotation costs. We investigate the trade-off between the number of\nitems ($N$) and the number of responses per item ($K$) needed for reliable\nmachine learning evaluation. We analyze a diverse collection of categorical\ndatasets for which multiple annotations per item exist, and simulated\ndistributions fit to these datasets, to determine the optimal $(N, K)$\nconfiguration, given a fixed budget ($N \\times K$), for collecting evaluation\ndata and reliably comparing the performance of machine learning models. Our\nfindings show, first, that accounting for human disagreement may come with $N\n\\times K$ at no more than 1000 (and often much lower) for every dataset tested\non at least one metric. Moreover, this minimal $N \\times K$ almost always\noccurred for $K > 10$. Furthermore, the nature of the tradeoff between $K$ and\n$N$ -- or if one even existed -- depends on the evaluation metric, with metrics\nthat are more sensitive to the full distribution of responses performing better\nat higher levels of $K$. Our methods can be used to help ML practitioners get\nmore effective test data by finding the optimal metrics and number of items and\nannotations per item to collect to get the most reliability for their budget."}
