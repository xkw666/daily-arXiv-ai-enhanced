Although\nnumerous automatic evaluation methods exist, current research lacks a\nsystematic framework that comprehensively organizes these methods across text,\nvisual, and audio modalities. To address this issue, we present a comprehensive\nreview and a unified taxonomy of automatic evaluation methods for generated\ncontent across all three modalities; We identify five fundamental paradigms\nthat characterize existing evaluation approaches across these domains. Our\nanalysis begins by examining evaluation methods for text generation, where\ntechniques are most mature.

In recent decades, DEM has found widespread applications in fields\nsuch as data visualization, geometry processing, and medical imaging.\nTraditional approaches to DEM primarily rely on iterative numerical solvers for\ndiffusion equations or optimization-based methods that minimize handcrafted\nenergy functionals. However, these conventional techniques often face several\nchallenges: they may suffer from limited accuracy, produce overlapping\nartifacts in extreme cases, and require substantial algorithmic redesign when\nextended from 2D to 3D, due to the derivative-dependent nature of their energy\nformulations. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based\ndensity-equalizing mapping framework (LDEM) using deep neural networks.\nSpecifically, we introduce a loss function that enforces density uniformity and\ngeometric regularity, and utilize a hierarchical approach to predict the\ntransformations at both the coarse and dense levels. Our method demonstrates\nsuperior density-equalizing and bijectivity properties compared to prior\nmethods for a wide range of simple and complex density distributions, and can\nbe easily applied to surface remeshing with different effects.

Large Language Models (LLMs) and other modern NLP systems face\ninherent limitations precisely because they operate within natural language\nitself, making them subject to the same interpretive constraints imposed by\nsemantic degeneracy. In this work, we argue using Kolmogorov complexity that as\nan expression's complexity grows, the likelihood of any interpreting agent\n(human or LLM-powered AI) recovering the single intended meaning vanishes. This\ncomputational intractability suggests the classical view that linguistic forms\npossess meaning in and of themselves is flawed. We alternatively posit that\nmeaning is instead actualized through an observer-dependent interpretive act.\nTo test this, we conducted a semantic Bell inequality test using diverse LLM\nagents as ``computational cognitive systems'' to interpret ambiguous word pairs\nunder varied contextual settings. Across several independent experiments, we\nfound average CHSH expectation values ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, with several\nruns yielding values (e.g., 2.3-2.4) that significantly violate the classical\nboundary ($|S|\\leq2$). This demonstrates that linguistic interpretation under\nambiguity can exhibit non-classical contextuality, consistent with results from\nhuman cognition experiments.

Our\ntheoretical analysis shows that the OCR capability can be attributed to the\nimplicit bias of gradient descent, which favors solutions that minimize the\nnuclear norm of the combined output-value matrix.

A key question is how to find directions that\ncapture interpretable features in an unsupervised manner. Current methods rely\non dictionary learning with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), commonly trained over\nresidual stream activations to learn directions from scratch.

We\nconceptualize effective audio-LLM interaction as the LLM's ability to\nproficiently probe the audio encoder representations to satisfy textual\nqueries.

Beginning with a standard Pengi/LLaVA-style\naudio-LLM architecture, we propose and evaluate several modifications guided by\nhypotheses derived from mechanistic interpretability studies and LLM\noperational principles. Our experiments demonstrate that: (1) delaying audio\nintegration until the LLM's initial layers establish textual context that\nenhances its ability to probe the audio representations for relevant\ninformation; (2) the LLM can proficiently probe audio representations\nexclusively through LLM layer's attention submodule, without requiring\npropagation to its Feed-Forward Network (FFN) submodule; (3) an efficiently\nintegrated ensemble of diverse audio encoders provides richer, complementary\nrepresentations, thereby broadening the LLM's capacity to probe a wider\nspectrum of audio information.

We construct a standardized dataset covering 11\nprimary tasks and 560 representative toxic molecules spanning diverse\nmechanisms and granularities. We design a prompt annotation pipeline with\nmechanism-aware and task-adaptive capabilities, informed by expert\ntoxicological knowledge. In parallel, we propose an automated evaluation\nframework, ToxiEval, which integrates toxicity endpoint prediction, synthetic\naccessibility, drug-likeness, and structural similarity into a high-throughput\nevaluation chain for repair success. We systematically assess nearly 30\nmainstream general-purpose MLLMs and design multiple ablation studies to\nanalyze key factors such as evaluation criteria, candidate diversity, and\nfailure attribution.

We address these failures\nthrough internal bias mitigation: by identifying and neutralizing sensitive\nattribute directions within model activations, we achieve robust bias reduction\nacross all tested scenarios. Across leading commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 4\nSonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash) and open-source models (Gemma-2 27B, Gemma-3,\nMistral-24B), we find that adding realistic context such as company names,\nculture descriptions from public careers pages, and selective hiring\nconstraints (e.g.,``only accept candidates in the top 10\\%\") induces\nsignificant racial and gender biases (up to 12\\% differences in interview\nrates). When these biases emerge, they consistently favor Black over White\ncandidates and female over male candidates across all tested models and\nscenarios. Moreover, models can infer demographics and become biased from\nsubtle cues like college affiliations, with these biases remaining invisible\neven when inspecting the model's chain-of-thought reasoning. To address these\nlimitations, our internal bias mitigation identifies race and gender-correlated\ndirections and applies affine concept editing at inference time. Despite using\ndirections from a simple synthetic dataset, the intervention generalizes\nrobustly, consistently reducing bias to very low levels (typically under 1\\%,\nalways below 2.5\\%) while largely maintaining model performance. Our findings\nsuggest that practitioners deploying LLMs for hiring should adopt more\nrealistic evaluation methodologies and consider internal mitigation strategies\nfor equitable outcomes."}

While prior work has primarily\nfocused on architectural innovations, the influence of data-level factors on\nunlearning performance remains underexplored. As a result, existing methods\noften suffer from degraded retention when forgetting high-impact data. To\naddress this, we propose GUARD-a novel framework for Guided Unlearning And\nRetention via Data attribution. At its core, GUARD introduces a lightweight\nproxy data attribution metric tailored for LLM unlearning, which quantifies the\n\"alignment\" between the forget and retain sets while remaining computationally\nefficient. Building on this, we design a novel unlearning objective that\nassigns adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weights to samples, inversely\nproportional to their proxy attribution scores. Through such a reallocation of\nunlearning power, GUARD mitigates unintended losses in retention. We provide\nrigorous theoretical guarantees that GUARD significantly enhances retention\nwhile maintaining forgetting metrics comparable to prior methods. Extensive\nexperiments on the TOFU benchmark across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate\nthat GUARD substantially improves utility preservation while ensuring effective\nunlearning. Notably, GUARD reduces utility sacrifice on the Retain Set by up to\n194.92% in terms of Truth Ratio when forgetting 10% of the training data."}
