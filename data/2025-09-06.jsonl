These\nsystems aim to create immersive user experiences through consistent persona\nadoption. However, current RPCA research faces dual limitations. First,\nexisting work predominantly focuses on the textual modality, entirely\noverlooking critical paralinguistic features including intonation, prosody, and\nrhythm in speech, which are essential for conveying character emotions and\nshaping vivid identities. Second, the speech-based role-playing domain suffers\nfrom a long-standing lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. Most current\nspoken dialogue datasets target only fundamental capability assessments,\nfeaturing thinly sketched or ill-defined character profiles. Consequently, they\nfail to effectively quantify model performance on core competencies like\nlong-term persona consistency. To address this critical gap, we introduce\nVoxRole, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for the\nevaluation of speech-based RPCAs. The benchmark comprises 13335 multi-turn\ndialogues, totaling 65.6 hours of speech from 1228 unique characters across 261\nmovies. To construct this resource, we propose a novel two-stage automated\npipeline that first aligns movie audio with scripts and subsequently employs an\nLLM to systematically build multi-dimensional profiles for each character.\nLeveraging VoxRole, we conduct a multi-dimensional evaluation of contemporary\nspoken dialogue models, revealing crucial insights into their respective\nstrengths and limitations in maintaining persona consistency."}

Existing evaluations consider\nthese capabilities in isolation: FID and GenEval for T2I, and benchmarks such\nas MME, MMBench for I2T. These single-pass metrics do not reveal whether a\nmodel that understands a concept can also render it, nor whether meaning is\npreserved when cycling between image and text modalities. To address this, we\nintroduce the Unified Consistency Framework for Unified Models (UCF-UM), a\ncyclic evaluation protocol that alternates I2T and T2I over multiple\ngenerations to quantify semantic drift. UCF formulates 3 metrics: (i) Mean\nCumulative Drift (MCD), an embedding-based measure of overall semantic loss;\n(ii) Semantic Drift Rate (SDR), that summarizes semantic decay rate; and (iii)\nMulti-Generation GenEval (MGG), an object-level compliance score extending\nGenEval. To assess generalization beyond COCO, which is widely used in\ntraining; we create a new benchmark ND400, sampled from NoCaps and DOCCI and\nevaluate on seven recent models. UCF-UM reveals substantial variation in\ncross-modal stability: some models like BAGEL maintain semantics over many\nalternations, whereas others like Vila-u drift quickly despite strong\nsingle-pass scores. Our results highlight cyclic consistency as a necessary\ncomplement to standard I2T and T2I evaluations, and provide practical metrics\nto consistently assess unified model's cross-modal stability and strength of\ntheir shared representations.

External memory is a natural way to persist these discoveries, and\nrecent work has shown clear benefits for reasoning-intensive tasks. We see an\nopportunity to make such memories more broadly reusable and scalable by moving\nbeyond instance-based memory entries (e.g. exact query/response pairs, or\nsummaries tightly coupled with the original problem context) toward\nconcept-level memory: reusable, modular abstractions distilled from solution\ntraces and stored in natural language. For future queries, relevant concepts\nare selectively retrieved and integrated into the prompt, enabling test-time\ncontinual learning without weight updates. Our design introduces new strategies\nfor abstracting takeaways from rollouts and retrieving entries for new queries,\npromoting reuse and allowing memory to expand with additional experiences. On\nthe challenging ARC-AGI benchmark, our method yields a 7.5% relative gain over\na strong no-memory baseline with performance continuing to scale with inference\ncompute. We find abstract concepts to be the most consistent memory design,\noutscoring the baseline at all tested inference compute scales. Moreover, we\nconfirm that dynamically updating memory during test-time outperforms an\notherwise identical fixed memory setting with additional attempts, supporting\nthe hypothesis that solving more problems and abstracting more patterns to\nmemory enables further solutions in a form of self-improvement.

However, navigating and understanding these models\nremains challenging due to inconsistent metadata and unstructured repositories.\nWe introduce Delta Activations, a method to represent finetuned models as\nvector embeddings by measuring shifts in their internal activations relative to\na base model. This representation allows for effective clustering by domain and\ntask, revealing structure in the model landscape. Delta Activations also\ndemonstrate desirable properties: it is robust across finetuning settings and\nexhibits an additive property when finetuning datasets are mixed. In addition,\nwe show that Delta Activations can embed tasks via few-shot finetuning, and\nfurther explore its use for model selection and merging. We hope Delta\nActivations can facilitate the practice of reusing publicly available models.\nCode is available at https://github.com/OscarXZQ/delta_activations."}
