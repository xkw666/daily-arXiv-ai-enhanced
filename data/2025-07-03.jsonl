However, scaling to larger environments has so far relied on\npartitioning the scene into chunks -- a strategy that introduces artifacts at\nchunk boundaries, complicates training across varying scales, and is poorly\nsuited to unstructured scenarios such as city-scale flyovers combined with\nstreet-level views. Moreover, rendering remains fundamentally limited by GPU\nmemory, as all visible chunks must reside in VRAM simultaneously. We introduce\nA LoD of Gaussians, a framework for training and rendering ultra-large-scale\nGaussian scenes on a single consumer-grade GPU -- without partitioning. Our\nmethod stores the full scene out-of-core (e.g., in CPU memory) and trains a\nLevel-of-Detail (LoD) representation directly, dynamically streaming only the\nrelevant Gaussians. A hybrid data structure combining Gaussian hierarchies with\nSequential Point Trees enables efficient, view-dependent LoD selection, while a\nlightweight caching and view scheduling system exploits temporal coherence to\nsupport real-time streaming and rendering. Together, these innovations enable\nseamless multi-scale reconstruction and interactive visualization of complex\nscenes -- from broad aerial views to fine-grained ground-level details."}

While conceptually simple,\nthe task remains challenging because diffusion models often insert incorrect or\ninconsistent content and cannot readily generate chrome balls in HDR format.\nOur analysis reveals that the inpainting process is highly sensitive to the\ninitial noise in the diffusion process, occasionally resulting in unrealistic\noutputs. To address this, we first introduce DiffusionLight, which uses\niterative inpainting to compute a median chrome ball from multiple outputs to\nserve as a stable, low-frequency lighting prior that guides the generation of a\nhigh-quality final result.

Many\nendeavors to improve SD are to eliminate the need for a draft model and\ngenerate draft tokens in a retrieval-based manner in order to further alleviate\nthe drafting overhead and significantly reduce the difficulty in deployment and\napplications. However, retrieval-based SD relies on a matching paradigm to\nretrieval the most relevant reference as the draft tokens, where these methods\noften fail to find matched and accurate draft tokens. To address this\nchallenge, we propose LogitSpec to effectively expand the retrieval range and\nfind the most relevant reference as drafts. Our LogitSpec is motivated by the\nobservation that the logit of the last token can not only predict the next\ntoken, but also speculate the next next token. Specifically, LogitSpec\ngenerates draft tokens in two steps: (1) utilizing the last logit to speculate\nthe next next token; (2) retrieving relevant reference for both the next token\nand the next next token. LogitSpec is training-free and plug-and-play, which\ncan be easily integrated into existing LLM inference frameworks. Extensive\nexperiments on a wide range of text generation benchmarks demonstrate that\nLogitSpec can achieve up to 2.61 $\\times$ speedup and 3.28 mean accepted tokens\nper decoding step.

Yet, small language models (SLMs) often struggle to learn long-form\nCoT reasoning due to their limited capacity, a phenomenon we refer to as the\n\"SLMs Learnability Gap\". To address this, we introduce\n\\textbf{Mi}d-\\textbf{Co}T \\textbf{T}eacher \\textbf{A}ssistant Distillation\n(MiCoTAl), a framework for improving long CoT distillation for SLMs. MiCoTA\nemploys intermediate-sized models as teacher assistants and utilizes\nintermediate-length CoT sequences to bridge both the capacity and reasoning\nlength gaps. Our experiments on downstream tasks demonstrate that although SLMs\ndistilled from large teachers can perform poorly, by applying MiCoTA, they\nachieve significant improvements in reasoning performance. Specifically,\nQwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct achieve an improvement of 3.47 and\n3.93 respectively on average score on AIME2024, AMC, Olympiad, MATH-500 and\nGSM8K benchmarks. To better understand the mechanism behind MiCoTA, we perform\na quantitative experiment demonstrating that our method produces data more\nclosely aligned with base SLM distributions. Our insights pave the way for\nfuture research into long-CoT data distillation for SLMs."}

Each paradigm presents a distinct trade-off: SFT excels at mimicking\ndemonstration data but can lead to problematic generalization as a form of\nbehavior cloning. Conversely, RFT can significantly enhance a model's\nperformance but is prone to learn unexpected behaviors, and its performance is\nhighly sensitive to the initial policy. In this paper, we propose a unified\nview of these methods and introduce Prefix-RFT, a hybrid approach that\nsynergizes learning from both demonstration and exploration. Using mathematical\nreasoning problems as a testbed, we empirically demonstrate that Prefix-RFT is\nboth simple and effective. It not only surpasses the performance of standalone\nSFT and RFT but also outperforms parallel mixed-policy RFT methods. A key\nadvantage is its seamless integration into existing open-source frameworks,\nrequiring only minimal modifications to the standard RFT pipeline. Our analysis\nhighlights the complementary nature of SFT and RFT, and validates that\nPrefix-RFT effectively harmonizes these two learning paradigms. Furthermore,\nablation studies confirm the method's robustness to variations in the quality\nand quantity of demonstration data. We hope this work offers a new perspective\non LLM post-training, suggesting that a unified paradigm that judiciously\nintegrates demonstration and exploration could be a promising direction for\nfuture research."}

However, its reliance on\nlarge volumes of labeled data raises privacy and security concerns such as\nsusceptibility to data poisoning attacks and the risk of overfitting. In\ncontrast, black box optimization methods, which treat the model as an opaque\nfunction, relying solely on function evaluations to guide optimization, offer a\npromising alternative in scenarios where data access is restricted, adversarial\nrisks are high, or overfitting is a concern. However, black box methods also\npose significant challenges, including poor scalability to high-dimensional\nparameter spaces, as prevalent in large language models (LLMs), and high\ncomputational costs due to reliance on numerous model evaluations. This paper\nintroduces BBoxER, an evolutionary black-box method for LLM post-training that\ninduces an information bottleneck via implicit compression of the training\ndata. Leveraging the tractability of information flow, we provide strong\ntheoretical bounds on generalization, differential privacy, susceptibility to\ndata poisoning attacks, and robustness to extraction attacks. BBoxER operates\non top of pre-trained LLMs, offering a lightweight and modular enhancement\nsuitable for deployment in restricted or privacy-sensitive environments, in\naddition to non-vacuous generalization guarantees. In experiments with LLMs, we\ndemonstrate empirically that Retrofitting methods are able to learn, showing\nhow a few iterations of BBoxER improve performance and generalize well on a\nbenchmark of reasoning datasets. This positions BBoxER as an attractive add-on\non top of gradient-based optimization."}

However, their\nwidespread adoption remains limited by the reliance on GPU-based training. In\nthis work, we propose a theoretically grounded approach to LoRA fine-tuning\ndesigned specifically for users with limited computational resources,\nparticularly those restricted to standard laptop CPUs. Our method learns a\nmeta-operator that maps any input dataset, represented as a probability\ndistribution, to a set of LoRA weights by leveraging a large bank of\npre-trained adapters for the Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 model. Instead of\nperforming new gradient-based updates, our pipeline constructs adapters via\nlightweight combinations of existing LoRAs directly on CPU.
