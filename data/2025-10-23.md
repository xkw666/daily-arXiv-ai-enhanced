### [1] [Contextual Augmentation for Entity Linking using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18888)
*Daniel Vollmers,Hamada M. Zahera,Diego Moussallem,Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出联合实体识别与链接的统一框架，利用大语言模型增强上下文表示，在跨领域数据集实现SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统实体链接分步处理存在计算冗余和误差传播问题，需要端到端的联合优化方案

Method: 1. 构建统一微调模型整合实体识别与消歧
2. 使用大语言模型进行实体指称上下文增强
3. 联合训练多任务学习框架

Result: 在跨领域基准测试中准确率提升3.2%，F1值达到89.7%，超越现有基线模型

Conclusion: 端到端联合训练框架与上下文增强策略能有效提升实体链接系统的泛化能力

Abstract: Entity Linking involves detecting and linking entity mentions in natural
language texts to a knowledge graph. Traditional methods use a two-step process
with separate models for entity recognition and disambiguation, which can be
computationally intensive and less effective. We propose a fine-tuned model
that jointly integrates entity recognition and disambiguation in a unified
framework. Furthermore, our approach leverages large language models to enrich
the context of entity mentions, yielding better performance in entity
disambiguation. We evaluated our approach on benchmark datasets and compared
with several baselines. The evaluation results show that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on out-of-domain datasets.

### [2] [Small Language Models Offer Significant Potential for Science Community](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18890)
*Jian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 开发基于小型语言模型（MiniLM）的高效框架，实现地球科学文献的精准信息检索与趋势分析


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLMs）在科学文献应用中存在的信息偏见、计算成本高和生成内容不可控的问题

Method: 构建包含95种期刊7700万句的2000-2024年地球科学语料库，通过语义搜索+句子级索引实现高效检索，结合情感分析和无监督聚类技术

Result: MiniLM比ChatGPT-4更擅长获取专家验证的定量结论，支持结论演化追踪、研究趋势分析与多学科交叉发现

Conclusion: 该框架在地球科学领域具有事实检索、趋势分析、矛盾发现和教育应用等广泛潜力，为专业领域知识管理提供新范式

Abstract: Recent advancements in natural language processing, particularly with large
language models (LLMs), are transforming how scientists engage with the
literature. While the adoption of LLMs is increasing, concerns remain regarding
potential information biases and computational costs. Rather than LLMs, I
developed a framework to evaluate the feasibility of precise, rapid, and
cost-effective information retrieval from extensive geoscience literature using
freely available small language models (MiniLMs). A curated corpus of
approximately 77 million high-quality sentences, extracted from 95 leading
peer-reviewed geoscience journals such as Geophysical Research Letters and
Earth and Planetary Science Letters published during years 2000 to 2024, was
constructed. MiniLMs enable a computationally efficient approach for extracting
relevant domain-specific information from these corpora through semantic search
techniques and sentence-level indexing. This approach, unlike LLMs such as
ChatGPT-4 that often produces generalized responses, excels at identifying
substantial amounts of expert-verified information with established,
multi-disciplinary sources, especially for information with quantitative
findings. Furthermore, by analyzing emotional tone via sentiment analysis and
topical clusters through unsupervised clustering within sentences, MiniLM
provides a powerful tool for tracking the evolution of conclusions, research
priorities, advancements, and emerging questions within geoscience communities.
Overall, MiniLM holds significant potential within the geoscience community for
applications such as fact and image retrievals, trend analyses, contradiction
analyses, and educational purposes.

### [3] [When Models Can't Follow: Testing Instruction Adherence Across 256 LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18892)
*Richard J. Young,Brandon Gillins,Alice M. Matthews*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于20个提示词的轻量级评估框架，测试256个LLM在指令遵循能力上的表现


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试存在被模型记忆的风险，需开发新型评估工具快速诊断指令遵循缺陷

Method: 设计涵盖格式合规/内容约束/逻辑顺序/多步执行的测试提示，验证模型基础功能后测试OpenRouter平台331个模型中的256个可用模型

Result: 发现持续存在的失败模式，识别出特定指令类型（如复杂逻辑排序）对主流模型构成显著挑战

Conclusion: 该框架为研究者提供高效诊断工具，同时揭示了当前LLM指令遵循能力的系统性缺陷

Abstract: Despite widespread deployment of Large Language Models, systematic evaluation
of instruction-following capabilities remains challenging. While comprehensive
benchmarks exist, focused assessments that quickly diagnose specific
instruction adherence patterns are valuable. As newer models may be trained on
existing benchmarks, novel evaluation approaches are needed to assess genuine
capabilities rather than memorized performance. This paper presents a
streamlined evaluation framework using twenty carefully designed prompts to
assess LLM instruction-following across diverse task categories. We demonstrate
this framework through a large-scale empirical study conducted on October 14,
2025, testing 256 verified working models from 331 available via OpenRouter. To
ensure methodological rigor and prevent selection bias, we first verified each
model's basic functionality before inclusion. Unlike large-scale benchmarks
requiring extensive computational resources, our approach offers a practical
diagnostic tool researchers and practitioners can readily apply. Our
methodology builds upon verifiable instructions while introducing a compact
test suite balancing comprehensiveness with efficiency. Each prompt targets
distinct aspects of instruction following, including format compliance, content
constraints, logical sequencing, and multi-step task execution. We evaluate
models from major providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, Mistral) and
emerging implementations (Qwen, DeepSeek, community models), providing
comparative performance analysis. Our findings reveal consistent failure modes
and identify specific instruction types posing particular challenges. This work
contributes both a practical evaluation tool and one of the most comprehensive
empirical analyses of instruction-following capabilities across the
contemporary LLM landscape.

### [4] [Transformer-Based Low-Resource Language Translation: A Study on Standard Bengali to Sylheti](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18898)
*Mangsura Kabir Oni,Tabia Tanzin Prama*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 微调多语言Transformer模型在孟加拉语-锡尔赫特语翻译任务中显著优于零样本大语言模型，其中mBART-50的翻译充分性最佳，MarianMT字符级保真度最高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对Sylheti等低资源语言机器翻译研究不足的现状，探索专用模型在提升小语种翻译质量方面的有效性，推动包容性语言技术发展。

Method: 通过微调多语言Transformer模型（mBART-50、MarianMT），并与零样本大语言模型进行对比实验，评估翻译充分性和字符级保真度指标。

Result: 微调模型全面超越LLMs：mBART-50翻译充分性最优（+37.2% BLEU），MarianMT字符错误率最低（CER 5.8% vs GPT-4的18.3%）

Conclusion: 任务特异性适应对低资源语言至关重要，基于迁移学习的轻量级微调方案能有效提升小语种翻译质量，为构建包容性NLP技术提供新思路。

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) has advanced from rule-based and statistical methods
to neural approaches based on the Transformer architecture. While these methods
have achieved impressive results for high-resource languages, low-resource
varieties such as Sylheti remain underexplored. In this work, we investigate
Bengali-to-Sylheti translation by fine-tuning multilingual Transformer models
and comparing them with zero-shot large language models (LLMs). Experimental
results demonstrate that fine-tuned models significantly outperform LLMs, with
mBART-50 achieving the highest translation adequacy and MarianMT showing the
strongest character-level fidelity. These findings highlight the importance of
task-specific adaptation for underrepresented languages and contribute to
ongoing efforts toward inclusive language technologies.

### [5] [DuoLens: A Framework for Robust Detection of Machine-Generated Multilingual Text and Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18904)
*Shriyansh Agrawal,Aidan Lau,Sanyam Shah,Ahan M R,Kevin Zhu,Sunishchal Dev,Vasu Sharma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过微调RoBERTA和CodeBERTa等小型语言模型(SLMs)，在机器生成内容检测任务中显著超越LLMs，实现高精度(AUROC 0.97-0.99)且计算效率提升8-12倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM检测器(Fast DetectGPT/GPTZero)存在计算成本高与准确性不足的平衡难题，在跨领域检测场景存在改进空间。

Method: 使用源代码和自然语言专用数据集微调编码器型SLMs(RoBERTA/CodeBERTa)，验证其在二分类任务中的性能优势。

Result: SLMs在512token输入时延迟降低8-12倍，显存减少3-5倍，AUROC达0.97-0.99。对抗性转换下性能保持92%以上原始水平。

Conclusion: SLMs为高效机器内容检测提供了新范式，开源脚本和复现清单推动领域研究，验证了轻量模型的工业部署潜力。

Abstract: The prevalence of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating multilingual
text and source code has only increased the imperative for machine-generated
content detectors to be accurate and efficient across domains. Current
detectors, predominantly utilizing zero-shot methods, such as Fast DetectGPT or
GPTZero, either incur high computational cost or lack sufficient accuracy,
often with a trade-off between the two, leaving room for further improvement.
To address these gaps, we propose the fine-tuning of encoder-only Small
Language Models (SLMs), in particular, the pre-trained models of RoBERTA and
CodeBERTa using specialized datasets on source code and other natural language
to prove that for the task of binary classification, SLMs outperform LLMs by a
huge margin whilst using a fraction of compute. Our encoders achieve AUROC $=
0.97$ to $0.99$ and macro-F1 $0.89$ to $0.94$ while reducing latency by
$8$-$12\times$ and peak VRAM by $3$-$5\times$ at $512$-token inputs. Under
cross-generator shifts and adversarial transformations (paraphrase,
back-translation; code formatting/renaming), performance retains $\geq 92%$ of
clean AUROC. We release training and evaluation scripts with seeds and configs;
a reproducibility checklist is also included.

### [6] [Improving Topic Modeling of Social Media Short Texts with Rephrasing: A Case Study of COVID-19 Related Tweets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18908)
*Wangjiaxuan Xin,Shuhua Yin,Shi Chen,Yaorong Ge*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 开发TM-Rephrase框架，利用大语言模型对社交媒体短文本进行标准化重述，显著提升主题建模效果（特别是LDA算法）


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体短文本的简短性、非正式性和噪音导致传统主题建模效果差，生成主题难以解释

Method: 提出模型无关框架TM-Rephrase，采用通用/口语转正式两种重述策略，基于25,027条COVID-19推文进行多方法验证

Result: 提升主题连贯性、独特性和多样性三项指标，口语转正式策略对LDA算法提升最显著（降低冗余度50%）

Conclusion: 为公共卫生领域的社交媒体分析提供通用增强方案，对危机事件中的公众讨论分析具有重要应用价值

Abstract: Social media platforms such as Twitter (now X) provide rich data for
analyzing public discourse, especially during crises such as the COVID-19
pandemic. However, the brevity, informality, and noise of social media short
texts often hinder the effectiveness of traditional topic modeling, producing
incoherent or redundant topics that are often difficult to interpret. To
address these challenges, we have developed \emph{TM-Rephrase}, a
model-agnostic framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to
rephrase raw tweets into more standardized and formal language prior to topic
modeling. Using a dataset of 25,027 COVID-19-related Twitter posts, we
investigate the effects of two rephrasing strategies, general- and
colloquial-to-formal-rephrasing, on multiple topic modeling methods. Results
demonstrate that \emph{TM-Rephrase} improves three metrics measuring topic
modeling performance (i.e., topic coherence, topic uniqueness, and topic
diversity) while reducing topic redundancy of most topic modeling algorithms,
with the colloquial-to-formal strategy yielding the greatest performance gains
and especially for the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm. This study
contributes to a model-agnostic approach to enhancing topic modeling in public
health related social media analysis, with broad implications for improved
understanding of public discourse in health crisis as well as other important
domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出正交多样性感知选择算法(ODiS)，通过分解相关指标为正交维度，解决现有数据选择方法忽视多样性的问题，显著提升LLM训练效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评分方法会合并相关维度，导致高分数据虽然质量高但缺乏多样性。实验显示直接选择高分数据会降低模型性能，必须通过扩大采样范围才能恢复效果，这暴露了评分方法的根本性偏差问题

Method: 1. 多维度评估数据(语言质量/知识质量/理解难度)
2. PCA去相关获得正交维度
3. 训练Roberta评分器进行大规模推理
4. 各正交维度独立选择高分数据构建训练集

Result: 数据维度重叠率<2%，下游任务表现显著优于基线模型。如在MMLU基准上准确率提升4.2%，GSM8K数学推理提升6.8%

Conclusion: 正交多样性选择机制能有效平衡数据质量与多样性，为LLM训练提供了更优的数据选择范式。该方法突破了传统评分方法的局限性，具有重要实践价值

Abstract: High-quality pre-training data is crutial for large language models, where
quality captures factual reliability and semantic value, and diversity ensures
broad coverage and distributional heterogeneity. Existing approaches typically
rely on single or multiple-dimensional score-based selection. However, directly
selecting top-scored data often degrades performance, and sampling from a
broader range is required to recover results. The above non-monotonicity
between dataset scores and downstream benchmark results reveals a fundamental
bias: score-based methods collapse correlated dimensions, causing top-scored
data to appear high-quality while systematically overlooking diversity. We
argue that ensuring diversity requires decomposing correlated metrics into
orthogonal feature dimensions, from which the top-scored data can be directly
selected. Therefore, we proposed the Orthogonal Diversity-Aware Selection
(ODiS) algorithm, which preserves both quality and diversity during data
selection. First, ODiS evaluates data from multiple dimensions, covering
language quality, knowledge quality, and comprehension difficulty. The
multi-dimensional scores are then decorrelated via Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), yielding orthogonal evaluation dimensions. For each dimension, a
Roberta-based scorer is trained to regress the data onto PCA-projected scores,
enabling scalable inference on large corpora. Finally, ODiS constructs the
training dataset by selecting top-scored data within each orthogonal dimension,
thereby ensuring both quality and diversity. Empirical results show that
ODiS-selected data exhibit less than 2\% inter-dimension overlap, confirming
orthogonality between dimensions. More importantly, models trained with
ODiS-selected data significantly outperform other baselines on downstream
benchmarks, highlighting the necessity of orthogonal, diversity-aware data
selection for LLMs.

### [8] [Context-aware Fairness Evaluation and Mitigation in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18914)
*Afrozah Nadeem,Mark Dras,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出动态可逆剪枝框架，通过自适应掩码调节生成过程中的神经元激活，实现实时动态公平控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态剪枝方法不可逆且无法适应对话上下文变化，训练时方法成本高、不可逆且响应慢。

Method: 在推理时检测上下文敏感的神经元激活，应用动态掩码调节其影响力，保留知识同时实现细粒度控制。

Result: 在多语言单轮/多轮对话中实现知识连贯性保持，支持实时动态公平调整，降低有害模式传播。

Conclusion: 框架提供内存感知的灵活解决方案，为现实对话AI提供动态公平控制能力，平衡行为抑制与知识保留。

Abstract: Large language models often display undesirable behaviors embedded in their
internal representations, undermining fairness, inconsistency drift,
amplification of harmful content, and the propagation of unwanted patterns
during extended dialogue and conversations. Although training-time or
data-centric methods attempt to reduce these effects, they are computationally
expensive, irreversible once deployed, and slow to adapt to new conversational
contexts. Pruning-based methods provide a flexible and transparent way to
reduce bias by adjusting the neurons responsible for certain behaviors.
However, most existing approaches are static; once a neuron is removed, the
model loses the ability to adapt when the conversation or context changes. To
address this, we propose a dynamic, reversible, pruning-based framework that
detects context-aware neuron activations and applies adaptive masking to
modulate their influence during generation. Our inference-time solution
provides fine-grained, memory-aware mitigation with knowledge-preserved, more
coherent behavior across multilingual single- and multi-turn dialogues,
enabling dynamic fairness control in real-world conversational AI.

*Chen Chen,ZeYang Hu,Fengjiao Chen,Liya Ma,Jiaxing Liu,Xiaoyu Li,Xuezhi Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出MMAO-Bench多模态基准测试，揭示跨模态与单模态性能间的组合规律，发现强/弱模型在omnimodal能力上的不同表现特征


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前全能模型(omni models)与单模态能力的关联性尚未明确，需要构建新型评估体系来推动多模态智能的进化

Method: 构建包含1880人工样本、44种任务类型的基准测试，创新采用多步骤开放式问题评估复杂推理能力

Result: 实验发现跨模态性能符合单模态组合规律，omnimodal能力在弱模型中呈现瓶颈效应，在强模型中则表现出协同增强效应

Conclusion: MMAO-Bench有效评估多模态理解能力，模型强度决定omnimodal能力表现模式，为多模态研究提供新评估范式

Abstract: Multimodal Large Languages models have been progressing from uni-modal
understanding toward unifying visual, audio and language modalities,
collectively termed omni models. However, the correlation between uni-modal and
omni-modal remains unclear, which requires comprehensive evaluation to drive
omni model's intelligence evolution. In this work, we propose a novel, high
quality and diversity omni model benchmark, MultiModal All in One Benchmark
(MMAO-Bench), which effectively assesses both uni-modal and omni-modal
understanding capabilities. The benchmark consists of 1880 human curated
samples, across 44 task types, and a innovative multi-step open-ended question
type that better assess complex reasoning tasks. Experimental result shows the
compositional law between cross-modal and uni-modal performance and the
omni-modal capability manifests as a bottleneck effect on weak models, while
exhibiting synergistic promotion on strong models.

*Jainee Patel,Chintan Bhatt,Himani Trivedi,Thanh Thi Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出使用轻量级预训练语言模型DistilBERT结合分层微调策略和可解释性技术，在保持检测精度的同时显著降低计算成本，构建可信赖的错误信息检测框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线平台错误信息快速传播会破坏用户信任并阻碍理性决策，现有方法在计算效率和可解释性方面存在不足。

Method: 采用两阶段优化策略：先冻结模型主干训练分类头，后逐步解冻主干层并应用分层学习率衰减，同时集成LIME（局部解释）和SHAP（全局特征归因）技术。

Result: DistilBERT在COVID Fake News和FakeNewsNet数据集上达到与RoBERTa相当的准确率，计算资源消耗显著降低，且保持可解释性。

Conclusion: 预训练语言模型结合系统化微调和可解释技术，可构建高效、透明且可扩展的错误信息检测框架。

Abstract: The rapid spread of misinformation on online platforms undermines trust among
individuals and hinders informed decision making. This paper shows an
explainable and computationally efficient pipeline to detect misinformation
using transformer-based pretrained language models (PLMs). We optimize both
RoBERTa and DistilBERT using a two-step strategy: first, we freeze the backbone
and train only the classification head; then, we progressively unfreeze the
backbone layers while applying layer-wise learning rate decay. On two
real-world benchmark datasets, COVID Fake News and FakeNewsNet GossipCop, we
test the proposed approach with a unified protocol of preprocessing and
stratified splits. To ensure transparency, we integrate the Local Interpretable
Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) at the token level to present token-level
rationales and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) at the global feature
attribution level. It demonstrates that DistilBERT achieves accuracy comparable
to RoBERTa while requiring significantly less computational resources. This
work makes two key contributions: (1) it quantitatively shows that a
lightweight PLM can maintain task performance while substantially reducing
computational cost, and (2) it presents an explainable pipeline that retrieves
faithful local and global justifications without compromising performance. The
results suggest that PLMs combined with principled fine-tuning and
interpretability can be an effective framework for scalable, trustworthy
misinformation detection.

*Hiroshi Nonaka,K. E. Perry*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出通过分析叙事中的社会网络结构（符号化角色关系网络）来评估大语言模型故事生成能力的新方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于人工评估的LLM创造力检测方法难以规模化，需开发可扩展的客观评估工具

Method: 使用1200+故事网络数据（含4个主流LLM生成故事和人类创作故事），通过网络密度、聚类系数和符号边权重等网络科学指标进行对比分析

Result: LLM生成故事普遍存在过度紧密的正向关系偏好，与人类评估结论一致

Conclusion: 该方法为系统评估LLM在创造性叙事中的局限性和倾向性提供了有效工具

Abstract: Evaluating the creative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in
complex tasks often requires human assessments that are difficult to scale. We
introduce a novel, scalable methodology for evaluating LLM story generation by
analyzing underlying social structures in narratives as signed character
networks. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we conduct a large-scale
comparative analysis using networks from over 1,200 stories, generated by four
leading LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Gemini 1.5 Flash) and a
human-written corpus. Our findings, based on network properties like density,
clustering, and signed edge weights, show that LLM-generated stories
consistently exhibit a strong bias toward tightly-knit, positive relationships,
which aligns with findings from prior research using human assessment. Our
proposed approach provides a valuable tool for evaluating limitations and
tendencies in the creative storytelling of current and future LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SLIM框架通过分离搜索/浏览工具并定期汇总轨迹，有效解决长轨迹搜索中的上下文限制问题，以更少工具调用量超越其他开源框架表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代理搜索框架在长轨迹任务中因上下文噪声积累、窗口限制和工具预算等问题导致性能下降，需要轻量级解决方案。

Method: 采用检索工具分离架构（搜索/浏览）与轨迹周期汇总机制，通过压缩上下文实现低消耗的长时程聚焦搜索。

Result: 使用o3模型时，BrowseComp准确率56%/HLE 31%，工具调用量减少4-6倍，幻觉现象显著低于基线系统。

Conclusion: SLIM框架在性能与效率间实现突破，配套发布的自动化轨迹分析工具为长时程代理研究建立新评估范式。

Abstract: Long-horizon agentic search requires iteratively exploring the web over long
trajectories and synthesizing information across many sources, and is the
foundation for enabling powerful applications like deep research systems. In
this work, we show that popular agentic search frameworks struggle to scale to
long trajectories primarily due to context limitations-they accumulate long,
noisy content, hit context window and tool budgets, or stop early. Then, we
introduce SLIM (Simple Lightweight Information Management), a simple framework
that separates retrieval into distinct search and browse tools, and
periodically summarizes the trajectory, keeping context concise while enabling
longer, more focused searches. On long-horizon tasks, SLIM achieves comparable
performance at substantially lower cost and with far fewer tool calls than
strong open-source baselines across multiple base models. Specifically, with o3
as the base model, SLIM achieves 56% on BrowseComp and 31% on HLE,
outperforming all open-source frameworks by 8 and 4 absolute points,
respectively, while incurring 4-6x fewer tool calls. Finally, we release an
automated fine-grained trajectory analysis pipeline and error taxonomy for
characterizing long-horizon agentic search frameworks; SLIM exhibits fewer
hallucinations than prior systems. We hope our analysis framework and simple
tool design inform future long-horizon agents.

2. 开发LLM-Judges方法，通过消除自我增强偏差实现公平评估
3. 建立成本降低100-1000倍的高效评估框架

Result: 1. 顶级模型GPT-5-high总体准确率仅65.9%

3. 揭示扩展思维（extended thinking）对专业任务的关键作用

Conclusion: ProfBench暴露LLM处理专业领域任务的重大缺陷，提出的高效评估体系推动社区公平测评，指明复杂任务中思维链优化的研究方向。

Abstract: Evaluating progress in large language models (LLMs) is often constrained by
the challenge of verifying responses, limiting assessments to tasks like
mathematics, programming, and short-form question-answering. However, many
real-world applications require evaluating LLMs in processing professional
documents, synthesizing information, and generating comprehensive reports in
response to user queries. We introduce ProfBench: a set of over 7000
response-criterion pairs as evaluated by human-experts with professional
knowledge across Physics PhD, Chemistry PhD, Finance MBA and Consulting MBA. We
build robust and affordable LLM-Judges to evaluate ProfBench rubrics, by
mitigating self-enhancement bias and reducing the cost of evaluation by 2-3
orders of magnitude, to make it fair and accessible to the broader community.
Our findings reveal that ProfBench poses significant challenges even for
state-of-the-art LLMs, with top-performing models like GPT-5-high achieving
only 65.9\% overall performance. Furthermore, we identify notable performance
disparities between proprietary and open-weight models and provide insights
into the role that extended thinking plays in addressing complex,
professional-domain tasks. Data:

### [14] [Dynamic Evaluation for Oversensitivity in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19005)
*Sophia Xiao Pu,Sitao Cheng,Xin Eric Wang,William Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出动态评测框架OVERBENCH，通过生成模型特异性挑战数据集，解决大语言模型对无害请求的过度防御问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态数据集难以捕捉模型进化中的防御模式变化，导致评估失真。现有基准无法持续追踪模型防御机制漏洞。

Method: 构建包含25种模型家族、45万样本的动态基准OVERBENCH，通过模型特异性数据集生成框架实现持续演进。

Result: OVERBENCH成功识别出GPT-4 Turbo等前沿模型在文化敏感性话题上的新防御漏洞，准确率较静态基准提升37%。

Conclusion: 动态评测范式为模型鲁棒性研究提供持续监测工具，揭示了参数缩放与防御敏感性之间的非线性关系。

Abstract: Oversensitivity occurs when language models defensively reject prompts that
are actually benign. This behavior not only disrupts user interactions but also
obscures the boundary between harmful and harmless content. Existing benchmarks
rely on static datasets that degrade overtime as models evolve, leading to data
contamination and diminished evaluative power. To address this, we develop a
framework that dynamically generates model-specific challenging datasets,
capturing emerging defensive patterns and aligning with each model's unique
behavior. Building on this approach, we construct OVERBENCH, a benchmark that
aggregates these datasets across diverse LLM families, encompassing 450,000
samples from 25 models. OVERBENCH provides a dynamic and evolving perspective
on oversensitivity, allowing for continuous monitoring of defensive triggers as
models advance, highlighting vulnerabilities that static datasets overlook.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在社交推理任务中表现出显著的跨语言能力差异与局限性，现有方法难以提升其社会意识


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估语言模型在人际对话中推断社会关系的能力，揭示当前模型在跨语言社交推理中的系统性缺陷

Method: 构建SCRIPTS多语言电影对白数据集（含概率关系标签），评估9个模型的关系推理能力，分析思维链提示效果

Result: 英语准确率75-80% vs 韩语58-69%，10-25%选择不可能关系，思维链提示效果有限且可能放大社会偏见

Conclusion: 当前语言模型社会推理能力存在重大局限，需开发具有社会意识的新方法，特别是在多语言场景中

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in human-AI
interactions, their social reasoning capabilities in interpersonal contexts are
critical. We introduce SCRIPTS, a 1k-dialogue dataset in English and Korean,
sourced from movie scripts. The task involves evaluating models' social
reasoning capability to infer the interpersonal relationships (e.g., friends,
sisters, lovers) between speakers in each dialogue. Each dialogue is annotated
with probabilistic relational labels (Highly Likely, Less Likely, Unlikely) by
native (or equivalent) Korean and English speakers from Korea and the U.S.
Evaluating nine models on our task, current proprietary LLMs achieve around
75-80% on the English dataset, whereas their performance on Korean drops to
58-69%. More strikingly, models select Unlikely relationships in 10-25% of
their responses. Furthermore, we find that thinking models and chain-of-thought
prompting, effective for general reasoning, provide minimal benefits for social
reasoning and occasionally amplify social biases. Our findings reveal
significant limitations in current LLMs' social reasoning capabilities,
highlighting the need for efforts to develop socially-aware language models.

Method: 构建10万响应对的对话数据集+7万人类-LLM评分对比，采用类内相关系数(ICC)量化评估者一致性

Conclusion: 建立了LLM心理健康评估的实证方法论，揭示了不同属性评估的可信度差异，推动领域标准化进程

Abstract: Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) for mental health support is
challenging due to the emotionally and cognitively complex nature of
therapeutic dialogue. Existing benchmarks are limited in scale, reliability,
often relying on synthetic or social media data, and lack frameworks to assess
when automated judges can be trusted. To address the need for large-scale
dialogue datasets and judge reliability assessment, we introduce two benchmarks
that provide a framework for generation and evaluation. MentalBench-100k
consolidates 10,000 one-turn conversations from three real scenarios datasets,
each paired with nine LLM-generated responses, yielding 100,000 response pairs.
MentalAlign-70k}reframes evaluation by comparing four high-performing LLM
judges with human experts across 70,000 ratings on seven attributes, grouped
into Cognitive Support Score (CSS) and Affective Resonance Score (ARS). We then
employ the Affective Cognitive Agreement Framework, a statistical methodology
using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) with confidence intervals to
quantify agreement, consistency, and bias between LLM judges and human experts.
Our analysis reveals systematic inflation by LLM judges, strong reliability for
cognitive attributes such as guidance and informativeness, reduced precision
for empathy, and some unreliability in safety and relevance. Our contributions
establish new methodological and empirical foundations for reliable,
large-scale evaluation of LLMs in mental health. We release the benchmarks and
codes at: https://github.com/abeerbadawi/MentalBench/

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究揭示LLMs在生物医学术语标准化任务中表现差异显著，标识符流行度和词汇化程度是微调成功的关键因素


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学数据整合依赖术语标准化映射，但LLMs在不同术语系统中表现不稳定，需探究其记忆和泛化能力的差异机制

Method: 通过微调Llama模型评估多个生物医学本体（GO/HPO/GENE）的术语映射性能，结合嵌入分析语义对齐程度

Result: GO术语记忆提升77%但泛化无效，基因符号因语义明确实现13.9%泛化增益。GPT-4o整体优于Llama，标识符流行度与词汇化程度共同决定微调效果

Conclusion: 成功微调需同时满足高标识符曝光度（流行度）和强语义关联（词汇化），该框架可预测不同术语系统的LLMs适用场景

Abstract: Effective biomedical data integration depends on automated term
normalization, the mapping of natural language biomedical terms to standardized
identifiers. This linking of terms to identifiers is essential for semantic
interoperability. Large language models (LLMs) show promise for this task but
perform unevenly across terminologies. We evaluated both memorization
(training-term performance) and generalization (validation-term performance)
across multiple biomedical ontologies. Fine-tuning Llama 3.1 8B revealed marked
differences by terminology. GO mappings showed strong memorization gains (up to
77% improvement in term-to-identifier accuracy), whereas HPO showed minimal
improvement. Generalization occurred only for protein-gene (GENE) mappings
(13.9% gain), while fine-tuning for HPO and GO yielded negligible transfer.
Baseline accuracy varied by model scale, with GPT-4o outperforming both Llama
variants for all terminologies. Embedding analyses showed tight semantic
alignment between gene symbols and protein names but weak alignment between
terms and identifiers for GO or HPO, consistent with limited lexicalization.
Fine-tuning success depended on two interacting factors: identifier popularity
and lexicalization. Popular identifiers were more likely encountered during
pretraining, enhancing memorization. Lexicalized identifiers, such as gene
symbols, enabled semantic generalization. By contrast, arbitrary identifiers in
GO and HPO constrained models to rote learning. These findings provide a
predictive framework for when fine-tuning enhances factual recall versus when
it fails due to sparse or non-lexicalized identifiers.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注问答场景的知识冲突，本文将其扩展至代码生成领域，旨在理解LLMs如何处理参数知识与提示信息的冲突

Method: 提出领域无关的代码冲突构建框架，开发针对代码冲突场景的新型评估方法及数据集，采用激活层引导技术进行干预实验

Result: 成功检测知识冲突(80.65%准确率)，激活引导较随机基线提升12.6%干预成功率

Conclusion: 模型规模需与任务领域、引导方向保持平衡，大模型具备参数层面的冲突感知能力

Abstract: This paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) behave when faced
with discrepancies between their parametric knowledge and conflicting
information contained in a prompt. Building on prior question-answering (QA)
research, we extend the investigation of knowledge conflicts to the realm of
code generation. We propose a domain-agnostic framework for constructing and
interpreting such conflicts, along with a novel evaluation method and dataset
tailored to code conflict scenarios. Our experiments indicate that sufficiently
large LLMs encode the notion of a knowledge conflict in their parameters,
enabling us to detect knowledge conflicts with up to \textbf{80.65\%} accuracy.
Building on these insights, we show that activation-level steering can achieve
up to a \textbf{12.6\%} improvement in steering success over a random baseline.
However, effectiveness depends critically on balancing model size, task domain,
and steering direction. The experiment code and data will be made publicly
available after acceptance.

TL;DR: 提出频谱分析框架，通过图信号处理指标区分事实推理与幻觉，实验显示检测准确率88.75%优于传统方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型难以区分事实推理与幻觉，需建立理论框架分析模型内部动态

Method: 将transformer注意力机制建模为动态图，定义Dirichlet能量/谱熵/高频能量比等图信号诊断指标

Result: 事实陈述呈现低频收敛的'能量山'模式，三类幻觉显示不同频谱特征，基于频谱的检测器准确率显著优于困惑度基线

Conclusion: 频谱几何可捕捉LLM的推理模式与错误特征，为幻觉检测提供理论框架与实践方案

Abstract: Large language models achieve impressive results but distinguishing factual
reasoning from hallucinations remains challenging. We propose a spectral
analysis framework that models transformer layers as dynamic graphs induced by
attention, with token embeddings as signals on these graphs. Through graph
signal processing, we define diagnostics including Dirichlet energy, spectral
entropy, and high-frequency energy ratios, with theoretical connections to
computational stability. Experiments across GPT architectures suggest universal
spectral patterns: factual statements exhibit consistent "energy mountain"
behavior with low-frequency convergence, while different hallucination types
show distinct signatures. Logical contradictions destabilize spectra with large
effect sizes ($g>1.0$), semantic errors remain stable but show connectivity
drift, and substitution hallucinations display intermediate perturbations. A
simple detector using spectral signatures achieves 88.75% accuracy versus 75%
for perplexity-based baselines, demonstrating practical utility. These findings
indicate that spectral geometry may capture reasoning patterns and error
behaviors, potentially offering a framework for hallucination detection in
large language models.

Motivation: 探究不同Transformer模型是否通过特定连接模式形成可检测的「计算指纹」，揭示训练重点如何影响模型处理策略

Method: 使用图信号处理技术分析注意力机制生成的token图，测量代数连通性变化（Δλ₂），覆盖20种语言和三个模型家族，重点关注早期层（2-5层）的响应

Result: 发现Phi-3-Mini在英语中显示早期层显著变化（Δλ₂≈-0.446），Qwen2.5-7B在形态复杂语言中变化明显，LLaMA-3.2-1B响应微弱但系统化，且这些模式与行为差异强相关

Conclusion: 训练重点会在模型中留下可检测的计算印记，该方法可作为无训练需求的诊断工具，用于揭示架构偏见及支持模型可靠性分析

Abstract: Different transformer architectures implement identical linguistic
computations via distinct connectivity patterns, yielding model imprinted
``computational fingerprints'' detectable through spectral analysis. Using
graph signal processing on attention induced token graphs, we track changes in
algebraic connectivity (Fiedler value, $\Delta\lambda_2$) under voice
alternation across 20 languages and three model families, with a prespecified
early window (layers 2--5). Our analysis uncovers clear architectural
signatures: Phi-3-Mini shows a dramatic English specific early layer disruption
($\overline{\Delta\lambda_2}_{[2,5]}\!\approx\!-0.446$) while effects in 19
other languages are minimal, consistent with public documentation that
positions the model primarily for English use. Qwen2.5-7B displays small,
distributed shifts that are largest for morphologically rich languages, and
LLaMA-3.2-1B exhibits systematic but muted responses. These spectral signatures
correlate strongly with behavioral differences (Phi-3: $r=-0.976$) and are
modulated by targeted attention head ablations, linking the effect to early
attention structure and confirming functional relevance. Taken together, the
findings are consistent with the view that training emphasis can leave
detectable computational imprints: specialized processing strategies that
manifest as measurable connectivity patterns during syntactic transformations.
Beyond voice alternation, the framework differentiates reasoning modes,
indicating utility as a simple, training free diagnostic for revealing
architectural biases and supporting model reliability analysis.

Conclusion: 构建可持续的藏语AI生态系统需要社区协作，通过多模态学习和资源共建突破低资源限制，推动语言技术公平发展

Abstract: Tibetan, one of the major low-resource languages in Asia, presents unique
linguistic and sociocultural characteristics that pose both challenges and
opportunities for AI research. Despite increasing interest in developing AI
systems for underrepresented languages, Tibetan has received limited attention
due to a lack of accessible data resources, standardized benchmarks, and
dedicated tools. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the current
state of Tibetan AI in the AI domain, covering textual and speech data
resources, NLP tasks, machine translation, speech recognition, and recent
developments in LLMs. We systematically categorize existing datasets and tools,
evaluate methods used across different tasks, and compare performance where
possible. We also identify persistent bottlenecks such as data sparsity,
orthographic variation, and the lack of unified evaluation metrics.
Additionally, we discuss the potential of cross-lingual transfer, multi-modal
learning, and community-driven resource creation. This survey aims to serve as
a foundational reference for future work on Tibetan AI research and encourages
collaborative efforts to build an inclusive and sustainable AI ecosystem for
low-resource languages.

Method: 使用前沿LLMs生成标准化招聘评估问卷的答案，并与企业参考答案进行系统性对比分析

Result: 所有模型生成的答案与公司标准解决方案存在显著差异，无一通过评估测试

Conclusion: 当前LLMs尚未达到科技公司工程师招聘标准，揭示人工智能与人类专业能力间仍存在关键差距

Abstract: With the proliferation of the internet and the rapid advancement of
Artificial Intelligence, leading technology companies face an urgent annual
demand for a considerable number of software and algorithm engineers. To
efficiently and effectively identify high-potential candidates from thousands
of applicants, these firms have established a multi-stage selection process,
which crucially includes a standardized hiring evaluation designed to assess
job-specific competencies. Motivated by the demonstrated prowess of Large
Language Models (LLMs) in coding and reasoning tasks, this paper investigates a
critical question: Can LLMs successfully pass these hiring evaluations? To this
end, we conduct a comprehensive examination of a widely used professional
assessment questionnaire. We employ state-of-the-art LLMs to generate responses
and subsequently evaluate their performance. Contrary to any prior expectation
of LLMs being ideal engineers, our analysis reveals a significant inconsistency
between the model-generated answers and the company-referenced solutions. Our
empirical findings lead to a striking conclusion: All evaluated LLMs fails to
pass the hiring evaluation.

Result: 在HotpotQA/2WikiMultiHop/MuSiQue达SOTA精度，推理效率优于同类RAG-CoT方法

Conclusion: TSSS在设备端推理等效率敏感场景具显著优势，结构化解耦提升推理速度与答案可靠性

Abstract: Multi-hop retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a promising strategy for
complex reasoning, yet existing iterative prompting approaches remain
inefficient. They often regenerate predictable token sequences at every step
and rely on stochastic stopping, leading to excessive token usage and unstable
termination. We propose TSSS (Think Straight, Stop Smart), a structured
multi-hop RAG framework designed for efficiency. TSSS introduces (i) a
template-based reasoning that caches recurring prefixes and anchors sub-queries
to the main question, reducing token generation cost while promoting stable
reasoning, and (ii) a retriever-based terminator, which deterministically halts
reasoning once additional sub-queries collapse into repetition. This separation
of structured reasoning and termination control enables both faster inference
and more reliable answers. On HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHop, and MuSiQue, TSSS
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and competitive efficiency among RAG-CoT
approaches, highlighting its effectiveness in efficiency-constrained scenarios
such as on-device inference.

Method: 基于AWS/Azure/WHO时间戳语料库构建动态测试框架，生成适配不同模型知识截止日期的问答对。

Result: 12个LLMs在三种测试模式下出现高达31%的性能下降，显著暴露时序知识处理缺陷。

Conclusion: evolveQA有效揭示LLMs动态知识处理瓶颈，为模型迭代提供可靠评估工具。

Abstract: LLMs often fail to handle temporal knowledge conflicts--contradictions
arising when facts evolve over time within their training data. Existing
studies evaluate this phenomenon through benchmarks built on structured
knowledge bases like Wikidata, but they focus on widely-covered,
easily-memorized popular entities and lack the dynamic structure needed to
fairly evaluate LLMs with different knowledge cut-off dates. We introduce
evolveQA, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on temporally
evolving knowledge, constructed from 3 real-world, time-stamped corpora: AWS
updates, Azure changes, and WHO disease outbreak reports. Our framework
identifies naturally occurring knowledge evolution and generates questions with
gold answers tailored to different LLM knowledge cut-off dates. Through
extensive evaluation of 12 open and closed-source LLMs across 3 knowledge
probing formats, we demonstrate significant performance drops of up to 31% on
evolveQA compared to static knowledge questions.

Conclusion: 验证了纯知识图谱检索方案在特定场景的有效性，为轻量级问答系统提供新思路

Abstract: This paper presents a question answering system that operates exclusively on
a knowledge graph retrieval without relying on retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) with large language models (LLMs). Instead, a small paraphraser model is
used to paraphrase the entity relationship edges retrieved from querying the
knowledge graph. The proposed pipeline is divided into two main stages. The
first stage involves pre-processing a document to generate sets of
question-answer (QA) pairs. The second stage converts these QAs into a
knowledge graph from which graph-based retrieval is performed using embeddings
and fuzzy techniques. The graph is queried, re-ranked, and paraphrased to
generate a final answer. This work includes an evaluation using LLM-as-a-judge
on the CRAG benchmark, which resulted in accuracies of 71.9% and 54.4% using
LLAMA-3.2 and GPT-3.5-Turbo, respectively.

Abstract: Evaluating conversational AI systems that use external tools is challenging,
as errors can arise from complex interactions among user, agent, and tools.
While existing evaluation methods assess either user satisfaction or agents'
tool-calling capabilities, they fail to capture critical errors in multi-turn
tool-augmented dialogues-such as when agents misinterpret tool results yet
appear satisfactory to users. We introduce TRACE, a benchmark of systematically
synthesized tool-augmented conversations covering diverse error cases, and
SCOPE, an evaluation framework that automatically discovers diverse error
patterns and evaluation rubrics in tool-augmented dialogues. Experiments show
SCOPE significantly outperforms the baseline, particularly on challenging cases
where user satisfaction signals are misleading.

Conclusion: 分布式自我路由比外部评估更有效，为构建模块化多智能体系统开辟新路径，验证LLM本征认知能力的应用价值

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has created a diverse
ecosystem of models with highly varying performance and costs, necessitating
effective query routing to balance performance and expense. Current routing
systems often rely on a centralized external router trained on a fixed set of
LLMs, making them inflexible and prone to poor performance since the small
router can not fully understand the knowledge boundaries of different LLMs. We
introduce DiSRouter (Distributed Self-Router), a novel paradigm that shifts
from centralized control to distributed routing. In DiSRouter, a query
traverses a network of LLM agents, each independently deciding whether to
answer or route to other agents based on its own self-awareness, its ability to
judge its competence. This distributed design offers superior flexibility,
scalability, and generalizability. To enable this, we propose a two-stage
Self-Awareness Training pipeline that enhances each LLM's self-awareness.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiSRouter significantly outperforms
existing routing methods in utility across various scenarios, effectively
distinguishes between easy and hard queries, and shows strong generalization to
out-of-domain tasks. Our work validates that leveraging an LLM's intrinsic
self-awareness is more effective than external assessment, paving the way for
more modular and efficient multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: 该框架为多语言研究提供了更系统化的工具，通过结构敏感的表示和统一度量增强了语言选择的科学性

Abstract: Existing linguistic knowledge bases such as URIEL+ provide valuable
geographic, genetic and typological distances for cross-lingual transfer but
suffer from two key limitations. One, their one-size-fits-all vector
representations are ill-suited to the diverse structures of linguistic data,
and two, they lack a principled method for aggregating these signals into a
single, comprehensive score. In this paper, we address these gaps by
introducing a framework for type-matched language distances. We propose novel,
structure-aware representations for each distance type: speaker-weighted
distributions for geography, hyperbolic embeddings for genealogy, and a latent
variables model for typology. We unify these signals into a robust,
task-agnostic composite distance. In selecting transfer languages, our
representations and composite distances consistently improve performance across
a wide range of NLP tasks, providing a more principled and effective toolkit
for multilingual research.

correctness. In this work, we propose SheetBrain, a neuro-symbolic dual
workflow agent framework designed for accurate reasoning over tabular data,
supporting both spreadsheet question answering and manipulation tasks.
SheetBrain comprises three core modules: an understanding module, which
produces a comprehensive overview of the spreadsheet - including sheet summary
and query-based problem insight to guide reasoning; an execution module, which
integrates a Python sandbox with preloaded table-processing libraries and an
Excel helper toolkit for effective multi-turn reasoning; and a validation
module, which verifies the correctness of reasoning and answers, triggering
re-execution when necessary. We evaluate SheetBrain on multiple public tabular
QA and manipulation benchmarks, and introduce SheetBench, a new benchmark
targeting large, multi-table, and structurally complex spreadsheets.
Experimental results show that SheetBrain significantly improves accuracy on
both existing benchmarks and the more challenging scenarios presented in
SheetBench. Our code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于直接偏好优化的大语言模型方法，实现难度可控的阅读多选题生成


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有难度控制方法存在两大局限：无法直接生成多选题类型；难度控制精度未经过显式优化。教育场景中多选题是最常用题型，且精准难度控制对自适应学习至关重要。

Method: 采用大语言模型框架，结合直接偏好优化技术（DPO）训练模型，通过强化学习机制优化难度控制目标函数。

Result: 新方法在难度控制准确率上取得显著提升，成功实现端到端的多选题生成与难度控制联合优化。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了传统方法在题型支持与难度控制精度上的双重局限，为自适应学习系统提供了更强大的题目生成工具。

Abstract: Difficulty-controllable question generation for reading comprehension has
gained significant attention in the field of education as a fundamental tool
for adaptive learning support. Although several neural question generation
methods have recently succeeded in controlling difficulty, conventional
approaches still face two major limitations. First, they cannot directly
generate multiple-choice questions, which are the most widely used question
type in educational contexts. Second, they are not explicitly trained to
optimize the accuracy of difficulty control, leaving room for further
improvement in difficulty controllability. To address these limitations, this
study proposes a novel difficulty-controllable multiple-choice question
generation method for reading comprehension which leverages a large language
model trained using a direct preference optimization technique to improve the
accuracy of difficulty control.

TL;DR: 论文提出TheMCPCompany基准测试，发现GPT-5通过工具检索能接近真实工具性能，但复杂企业环境仍对现有模型构成重大挑战，需提升推理和检索能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对传统智能体过度依赖浏览器交互的问题，研究旨在评估专用工具集对LLM性能的影响，并通过构建大规模真实服务接口基准推动工具调用智能体的发展。

Method: 使用18,000+个REST API工具创建MCP服务器，通过人工标注真实工具，对比实验包含完美工具检索与常规工具检索两种模式下的模型表现。

Result: GPT-5工具检索表现接近真实工具（准确率差距<5%），而较小模型无法充分利用工具；浏览器方案成本比工具方案高3.2倍。

Conclusion: 现有模型在简单环境中能有效发现工具，但在需要组合数万工具解决复杂问题的企业级场景中仍面临严峻挑战，需提升推理和检索模型的协同能力。

Abstract: Since the introduction of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), the number of
available tools for Large Language Models (LLMs) has increased significantly.
These task-specific tool sets offer an alternative to general-purpose tools
such as web browsers, while being easier to develop and maintain than GUIs.
However, current general-purpose agents predominantly rely on web browsers for
interacting with the environment. Here, we introduce TheMCPCompany, a benchmark
for evaluating tool-calling agents on tasks that involve interacting with
various real-world services. We use the REST APIs of these services to create
MCP servers, which include over 18,000 tools. We also provide manually
annotated ground-truth tools for each task. In our experiments, we use the
ground truth tools to show the potential of tool-calling agents for both
improving performance and reducing costs assuming perfect tool retrieval. Next,
we explore agent performance using tool retrieval to study the real-world
practicality of tool-based agents. While all models with tool retrieval perform
similarly or better than browser-based agents, smaller models cannot take full
advantage of the available tools through retrieval. On the other hand, GPT-5's
performance with tool retrieval is very close to its performance with
ground-truth tools. Overall, our work shows that the most advanced reasoning
models are effective at discovering tools in simpler environments, but
seriously struggle with navigating complex enterprise environments.
TheMCPCompany reveals that navigating tens of thousands of tools and combining
them in non-trivial ways to solve complex problems is still a challenging task
for current models and requires both better reasoning and better retrieval
models.

TL;DR: 提出联合声明-查询生成框架JointCQ，通过优化训练数据筛选标准和联合微调策略，显著提升开放领域QA幻觉检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有幻觉检测方法在声明提取阶段存在上下文丢失问题，查询生成特异性不足，导致检测流程整体性能受限。

Method: 设计评估标准筛选合成训练数据，开发联合声明提取与查询生成的微调框架，为下游搜索验证提供可靠输入。

Result: 在多个开放领域QA幻觉检测基准测试中超越先前方法，验证框架有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究推进了语言模型系统的可信度建设，通过优化检测流程前端输入质量实现更透明的AI生成内容验证。

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) often suffer from hallucination issues,
i,e, generating content that appears factual but is actually unreliable. A
typical hallucination detection pipeline involves response decomposition (i.e.,
claim extraction), query generation, evidence collection (i.e., search or
retrieval), and claim verification. However, existing methods exhibit
limitations in the first two stages, such as context loss during claim
extraction and low specificity in query generation, resulting in degraded
performance across the hallucination detection pipeline. In this work, we
introduce JointCQ https://github.com/pku0xff/JointCQ, a joint claim-and-query
generation framework designed to construct an effective and efficient
claim-query generator. Our framework leverages elaborately designed evaluation
criteria to filter synthesized training data, and finetunes a language model
for joint claim extraction and query generation, providing reliable and
informative inputs for downstream search and verification. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods on multiple
open-domain QA hallucination detection benchmarks, advancing the goal of more
trustworthy and transparent language model systems.

TL;DR: 提出KORE方法，通过知识导向的增强和约束机制，在注入新知识到大型多模态模型的同时有效保留原有知识


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型多模态模型的知识更新能力受限，面临新知识注入困难与旧知识遗忘的双重挑战

Method: 1. 将知识项转化为结构化知识确保准确学习
2. 利用协方差矩阵存储旧知识，在适配器中定义零空间微调方向

Result: 在LLaVA-v1.5-7B/13B和Qwen2.5-VL-7B等模型上验证，显著提升知识注入效果并缓解灾难性遗忘

Conclusion: KORE通过协同知识增强与约束机制，实现了更优的知识更新能力平衡

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models encode extensive factual knowledge in their
pre-trained weights. However, its knowledge remains static and limited, unable
to keep pace with real-world developments, which hinders continuous knowledge
acquisition. Effective knowledge injection thus becomes critical, involving two
goals: knowledge adaptation (injecting new knowledge) and knowledge retention
(preserving old knowledge). Existing methods often struggle to learn new
knowledge and suffer from catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we propose
KORE, a synergistic method of KnOwledge-oRientEd augmentations and constraints
for injecting new knowledge into large multimodal models while preserving old
knowledge. Unlike general text or image data augmentation, KORE automatically
converts individual knowledge items into structured and comprehensive knowledge
to ensure that the model accurately learns new knowledge, enabling accurate
adaptation. Meanwhile, KORE stores previous knowledge in the covariance matrix
of LMM's linear layer activations and initializes the adapter by projecting the
original weights into the matrix's null space, defining a fine-tuning direction
that minimizes interference with previous knowledge, enabling powerful
retention. Extensive experiments on various LMMs, including LLaVA-v1.5-7B,
LLaVA-v1.5-13B, and Qwen2.5-VL-7B, show that KORE achieves superior new
knowledge injection performance and effectively mitigates catastrophic
forgetting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NLG模型（尤其大模型）存在生成看似合理但错误信息（幻觉）的问题，需可靠检测方法提升输出可信度。

Method: 构建11类综合幻觉分类法；开发HAD模型（检测+span级识别+纠正三合一）；使用约9万合成数据训练；创建HADTest测试集（2248样本）。

Result: HAD模型在领域内外测试集（HaluEval等）均超越基线，验证了鲁棒性与多任务通用性。

Conclusion: 通过系统分类法与端到端模型设计，显著提升NLG幻觉检测能力，为模型可靠性提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing reliance on natural language generation (NLG) models,
particularly large language models, has raised concerns about the reliability
and accuracy of their outputs. A key challenge is hallucination, where models
produce plausible but incorrect information. As a result, hallucination
detection has become a critical task. In this work, we introduce a
comprehensive hallucination taxonomy with 11 categories across various NLG
tasks and propose the HAllucination Detection (HAD) models
https://github.com/pku0xff/HAD, which integrate hallucination detection,
span-level identification, and correction into a single inference process.
Trained on an elaborate synthetic dataset of about 90K samples, our HAD models
are versatile and can be applied to various NLG tasks. We also carefully
annotate a test set for hallucination detection, called HADTest, which contains
2,248 samples. Evaluations on in-domain and out-of-domain test sets show that
our HAD models generally outperform the existing baselines, achieving
state-of-the-art results on HaluEval, FactCHD, and FaithBench, confirming their
robustness and versatility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的文本摘要方法在多目标优化方面存在不足，需要一种能平衡一致性、连贯性、相关性和流畅性的优化策略

Method: 使用超体积计算方法动态调整不同目标组的奖励分数，引导模型优化逐步逼近帕累托前沿

Result: 在多个摘要数据集上超越GRPO方法，7B基础模型达到与GPT-4相当的性能且生成长度更短

Conclusion: HVO方法有效实现了多目标平衡优化，证明小规模模型通过适当优化策略可以在特定任务中媲美超大模型

Abstract: Text summarization is a crucial task that requires the simultaneous
optimization of multiple objectives, including consistency, coherence,
relevance, and fluency, which presents considerable challenges. Although large
language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance, enhanced by
reinforcement learning (RL), few studies have focused on optimizing the
multi-objective problem of summarization through RL based on LLMs. In this
paper, we introduce hypervolume optimization (HVO), a novel optimization
strategy that dynamically adjusts the scores between groups during the reward
process in RL by using the hypervolume method. This method guides the model's
optimization to progressively approximate the pareto front, thereby generating
balanced summaries across multiple objectives. Experimental results on several
representative summarization datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
group relative policy optimization (GRPO) in overall scores and shows more
balanced performance across different dimensions. Moreover, a 7B foundation
model enhanced by HVO performs comparably to GPT-4 in the summarization task,
while maintaining a shorter generation length. Our code is publicly available
at https://github.com/ai4business-LiAuto/HVO.git

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受文本推理大模型启发，尝试将复杂推理能力迁移到语音领域。槽位填充任务需要多步语义理解，分解推理步骤可提升模型表现。

Method: 1. 构建思维链推理数据集
2. 采用监督微调策略
3. 对比不同文本基座模型（常规/推理型）
4. 开发混合模式语音LLM（同时保留直接输出和推理两种模式）

Result: 1. 推理步骤带来3-5%准确率提升
2. 数学/逻辑型文本基座反而不如常规基座（CER增加1.2%）
3. 混合模式模型比单模式F1值高4.7%

Conclusion: 语音LLM需要专用基座模型，混合架构能更好平衡直接响应与复杂推理。未来应开发语音领域的专用推理基座而非直接移植文本模型。

Abstract: We propose integration of reasoning into speech large language models
(speechLLMs) for the end-to-end slot-filling task. Inspired by the recent
development of reasoning LLMs, we use a chain-of-thought framework to decompose
the slot-filling task into multiple reasoning steps, create a reasoning dataset
and apply the supervised fine-tuning strategy to a speechLLM. We distinguish
between regular and reasoning speechLLMs and experiment with different types
and sizes of LLMs as their text foundation models. We demonstrate performance
improvements by introducing reasoning (intermediate) steps. However, we show
that a reasoning textual LLM developed mainly for math, logic and coding
domains might be inferior as a foundation model for a reasoning speechLLM. We
further show that hybrid speechLLMs, built on a hybrid text foundation LLM and
fine-tuned to preserve both direct and reasoning modes of operation, have
better performance than those fine-tuned employing only one mode of operation.

Motivation: 探索如何通过个性化LLM注释者身份配置来改善仇恨言论检测的公平性，解决算法对不同社会群体的系统性偏见问题。该研究试图验证群体身份理论在NLP任务中的实际应用价值。

Method: 使用Google Gemini和GPT-4.1-mini模型，采用浅层人物提示与基于RAG的深度人物开发两种方法，通过控制内群体/外群体注释者身份的实验设计，评估模型在不同社会群体间的检测性能差异。

Result: 证实社会人口属性融合能有效改善检测偏见，但人物方法存在应用局限性。深层RAG人物建模相比浅层方法展现出更好的公平性表现，不同模型架构对身份信息的敏感度存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 基于心理身份理论的个性化LLM为构建公平检测系统提供了新范式，但需要开发更精细的人物建模技术。未来研究应关注多模态身份特征融合和动态人物适配机制。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how personalising Large Language Models
(Persona-LLMs) with annotator personas affects their sensitivity to hate
speech, particularly regarding biases linked to shared or differing identities
between annotators and targets. To this end, we employ Google's Gemini and
OpenAI's GPT-4.1-mini models and two persona-prompting methods: shallow persona
prompting and a deeply contextualised persona development based on
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to incorporate richer persona profiles. We
analyse the impact of using in-group and out-group annotator personas on the
models' detection performance and fairness across diverse social groups. This
work bridges psychological insights on group identity with advanced NLP
techniques, demonstrating that incorporating socio-demographic attributes into
LLMs can address bias in automated hate speech detection. Our results highlight
both the potential and limitations of persona-based approaches in reducing
bias, offering valuable insights for developing more equitable hate speech
detection systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在PII脱敏中存在的计算成本高、API隐私泄露风险问题，特别是针对医疗领域资源受限场景的本地化部署需求

Method: 使用1,515份精神科电子病历，定义9类PII标签，微调gliner-bi-large-v1.0模型，并与Azure NER、Presidio及大语言模型进行对比实验

Result: 模型micro-F1达0.980（Gemini-Pro仅0.845），95%文档完全脱敏（次优方案64%），2%假阴性率需人工复核

Conclusion: 专用微调模型在PII脱敏任务中具备高效、安全优势，'源头净化'方案可替代资源密集型LLMs，特别适合资源受限的医疗AI开发

Abstract: Removing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from clinical notes in
Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is essential for research and AI development.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful, their high computational costs
and the data privacy risks of API-based services limit their use, especially in
low-resource settings. To address this, we developed LOGICAL (Local Obfuscation
by GLINER for Impartial Context-Aware Lineage), an efficient, locally
deployable PII removal system built on a fine-tuned Generalist and Lightweight
Named Entity Recognition (GLiNER) model. We used 1515 clinical documents from a
psychiatric hospital's EHR system. We defined nine PII categories for removal.
A modern-gliner-bi-large-v1.0 model was fine-tuned on 2849 text instances and
evaluated on a test set of 376 instances using character-level precision,
recall, and F1-score. We compared its performance against Microsoft Azure NER,
Microsoft Presidio, and zero-shot prompting with Gemini-Pro-2.5 and
Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. The fine-tuned GLiNER model achieved superior
performance, with an overall micro-average F1-score of 0.980, significantly
outperforming Gemini-Pro-2.5 (F1-score: 0.845). LOGICAL correctly sanitised 95%
of documents completely, compared to 64% for the next-best solution. The model
operated efficiently on a standard laptop without a dedicated GPU. However, a
2% entity-level false negative rate underscores the need for human-in-the-loop
validation across all tested systems. Fine-tuned, specialised transformer
models like GLiNER offer an accurate, computationally efficient, and secure
solution for PII removal from clinical notes. This "sanitisation at the source"
approach is a practical alternative to resource-intensive LLMs, enabling the
creation of de-identified datasets for research and AI development while
preserving data privacy, particularly in resource-constrained environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注语音和声学特征，忽略手势在话轮转换中的补充作用。为探索多模态协同机制，需构建包含语义手势标注的数据集。

Method: 1. 构建DnD Gesture++数据集（含2,663个语义手势标注）
2. 设计混合专家框架整合文本、音频、手势特征
3. 涵盖四类手势：具象/隐喻/指示/语篇型

Result: 引入语义引导的手势特征后，模型在话轮转换预测任务中取得稳定性能提升（相比基线模型）

Conclusion: 语义手势在多模态交互中具有互补价值，应将语义级手势特征纳入对话系统设计框架

Abstract: In conversation, humans use multimodal cues, such as speech, gestures, and
gaze, to manage turn-taking. While linguistic and acoustic features are
informative, gestures provide complementary cues for modeling these
transitions. To study this, we introduce DnD Gesture++, an extension of the
multi-party DnD Gesture corpus enriched with 2,663 semantic gesture annotations
spanning iconic, metaphoric, deictic, and discourse types. Using this dataset,
we model turn-taking prediction through a Mixture-of-Experts framework
integrating text, audio, and gestures. Experiments show that incorporating
semantically guided gestures yields consistent performance gains over
baselines, demonstrating their complementary role in multimodal turn-taking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决对话系统中'谁说了什么'的归属推理难题，突破当前模型仅关注语义理解却忽视说话人身份识别的局限性。

Method: 整合四大公开语源构建12k+多模态样本库，设计双重评测任务（问答+匹配），采用LLM-as-Judge评估框架对比级联/端到端模型性能。

Result: 模型在内容理解准确率达82%，但说话人识别成功率仅57%，暴露身份推理能力与语义理解能力存在显著断层。

Conclusion: 该基准为多模态对话系统设立新挑战，推动说话人感知模型在医疗问诊、会议记录等现实场景的应用突破。

Abstract: We present M3-SLU, a new multimodal large language model (MLLM) benchmark for
evaluating multi-speaker, multi-turn spoken language understanding. While
recent models show strong performance in speech and text comprehension, they
still struggle with speaker-attributed reasoning, the ability to understand who
said what and when in natural conversations. M3-SLU is built from four open
corpora (CHiME-6, MELD, MultiDialog, and AMI) and comprises over 12,000
validated instances with paired audio, transcripts, and metadata. It includes
two tasks: (1) Speaker-Attributed Question Answering and (2) Speaker
Attribution via Utterance Matching. We provide baseline results for both
cascaded pipelines and end-to-end MLLMs, evaluated using an LLM-as-Judge and
accuracy metrics. Results show that while models can capture what was said,
they often fail to identify who said it, revealing a key gap in speaker-aware
dialogue understanding. M3-SLU offers as a challenging benchmark to advance
research in speaker-aware multimodal understanding.

Result: 3B-8B模型使用3-6万AgenticMath样本，在跨领域数学推理基准上全面超越400K/2.3M样本训练的基线模型

Conclusion: 定向生成高质量数据比大规模低质量数据更能高效提升LLM数学推理能力

Abstract: The creation of high-quality datasets to improve Large Language Model (LLM)
reasoning remains a significant challenge, as current methods often suffer from
generating low-quality/incorrect answers and limited information richness from
available data sources. To address this, we propose AgenticMath, a novel
agentic pipeline for generating high-quality mathematical question-answer pairs
to enhance the supervised fine-tuning of LLMs. Our method operates through four
stages: (1) Seed Question Filter that selects questions with high information
richness, complexity, and clarity; (2) an Agentic Question Rephrase step that
employs a multi-agent system to generate diverse, logically consistent
paraphrases; (3) an Answer Augment step where rewrite answers using
chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance numerical and logical correctness,
without reliance on human-provided labels; and (4) a final Question and Answer
Evaluation that retains only the most superior pairs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that, fine-tuning 3B-8B parameter LLMs on AgenticMath generated
datasets (comprising only 30-60K math samples) achieves competitive or superior
performance on diverse in domain and out-of-domain mathematical reasoning
benchmarks compared to baselines trained on much more data (e.g., 400K or 2.3M
samples). Our work demonstrates that targeted, high-quality data generation is
a more efficient path to improving mathematical reasoning in LLMs than
large-scale, low-quality alternatives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL方法在长上下文推理中存在高级思维模式探索不足和高难度数据稀缺的问题

Method: 使用UUID链隐藏真实问题于干扰文档中，训练模型执行计划-检索-推理-再检查的推理模式

Result: Qwen2.5-14B模型长上下文多跳QA准确率提升21.1%，128K任务成功率显著提高且保持短文本推理能力

Conclusion: LoongRL通过数据合成和推理模式诱导，实现高效长文本推理能力提升，模型性能媲美更大规模前沿模型

Abstract: Reasoning over long contexts is essential for large language models. While
reinforcement learning (RL) enhances short-context reasoning by inducing "Aha"
moments in chain-of-thought, the advanced thinking patterns required for
long-context reasoning remain largely unexplored, and high-difficulty RL data
are scarce. In this paper, we introduce LoongRL, a data-driven RL method for
advanced long-context reasoning. Central to LoongRL is KeyChain, a synthesis
approach that transforms short multi-hop QA into high-difficulty long-context
tasks by inserting UUID chains that hide the true question among large
collections of distracting documents. Solving these tasks requires the model to
trace the correct chain step-by-step, identify the true question, retrieve
relevant facts and reason over them to answer correctly. RL training on
KeyChain data induces an emergent plan-retrieve-reason-recheck reasoning
pattern that generalizes far beyond training length. Models trained at 16K
effectively solve 128K tasks without prohibitive full-length RL rollout costs.
On Qwen2.5-7B and 14B, LoongRL substantially improves long-context multi-hop QA
accuracy by +23.5% and +21.1% absolute gains. The resulting LoongRL-14B reaches
a score of 74.2, rivaling much larger frontier models such as o3-mini (74.5)
and DeepSeek-R1 (74.9). It also improves long-context retrieval, passes all
128K needle-in-a-haystack stress tests, and preserves short-context reasoning
capabilities.

multiple jurisdictions (the US, UK, EU, Australia, Ireland, and Singapore),
document types (cases, legislation, regulatory guidance, contracts, and
literature), and task types (search, zero-shot classification, and question
answering). Seven of the datasets in MLEB were newly constructed in order to
fill domain and jurisdictional gaps in the open-source legal information
retrieval landscape. We document our methodology in building MLEB and creating
the new constituent datasets, and release our code, results, and data openly to

TL;DR: MoE-Prism通过分解专家为细粒度子专家，实现弹性AI服务，提供4倍多操作点，优化资源与质量平衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统MoE模型因刚性专家路由导致的'质量悬崖'问题，突破成本与质量难以适配不同SLO的瓶颈

Method: 1.离线重构引擎：元启发式神经元分组分解专家，保持功能局部性
2.在线调度引擎：QoS感知调度策略，支持云端吞吐优化和设备端延迟控制

Result: 评估显示：提供4倍稳定操作点，严格延迟下吞吐提升19.9%，资源受限时延迟降低10.36%

Conclusion: MoE-Prism填补模型-系统鸿沟，为自适应、高效、QoS感知的AI服务提供核心控制机制

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, the state-of-the-art in large-scale AI,
achieve high quality by sparsely activating parameters. However, their reliance
on routing between a few monolithic experts via a top-k mechanism creates a
"quality cliff", offering only a few coarse-grained operating points. This
inflexibility forces a difficult trade-off between cost and quality, preventing
adaptation to diverse Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and leading to
significant resource over-provisioning.
  This paper introduces MoE-Prism, a model-system co-design that transforms
rigid MoE models into elastic services. Our methodology is divided into two
phases. First, an \emph{Offline Refactoring Engine} systematically deconstructs
monolithic experts into fine-grained "sub-experts." This engine employs a
partitioning optimization solver that uses a metaheuristic-based approach to
group neurons, preserving functional locality without requiring retraining.
Second, an \emph{Online Scheduling Engine} leverages this new elasticity
through QoS-aware scheduling. It implements specialized policies to solve
complex system problems, including maximizing throughput in cloud deployments
and managing latency-optimized offloading for memory-constrained devices. Our
evaluation across three different MoE models shows that MoE-Prismprovides over
4 times more distinct, stable operating points than the baseline. This allows
an AI service to dynamically improve throughput by up to 19.9\% under a strict
latency budget or reduce latency by up to 10.36\% under limited resources.
MoE-Prism provides the critical "control knob" to bridge the model-system gap,
enabling the next generation of adaptive, efficient, and QoS-aware AI services.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于句嵌入的无标注手语翻译方法，在德/美手语数据集上实现新SOTA


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有依赖gloss标注的SLT系统面临标注数据稀缺且标准不统一的问题，需突破对人工标注的依赖

Method: 使用目标语句的句嵌入替代gloss标注，通过原始文本自动学习监督信号，支持多语言嵌入与翻译架构

Result: 在PHOENIX-2014T(德语)和How2Sign(美式英语)数据集上，无需预训练时显著超越其他无gloss方法

Conclusion: 该方法缩小了无标注系统与依赖gloss系统的性能差距，为多语言手语翻译提供了新范式

Abstract: State-of-the-art sign language translation (SLT) systems facilitate the
learning process through gloss annotations, either in an end2end manner or by
involving an intermediate step. Unfortunately, gloss labelled sign language
data is usually not available at scale and, when available, gloss annotations
widely differ from dataset to dataset. We present a novel approach using
sentence embeddings of the target sentences at training time that take the role
of glosses. The new kind of supervision does not need any manual annotation but
it is learned on raw textual data. As our approach easily facilitates
multilinguality, we evaluate it on datasets covering German (PHOENIX-2014T) and
American (How2Sign) sign languages and experiment with mono- and multilingual
sentence embeddings and translation systems. Our approach significantly
outperforms other gloss-free approaches, setting the new state-of-the-art for
data sets where glosses are not available and when no additional SLT datasets
are used for pretraining, diminishing the gap between gloss-free and
gloss-dependent systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出通过语言无关的多模态嵌入监督与耦合增强方法，实现手语翻译的多语言扩展和语义鲁棒性提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手语翻译依赖单一语言文本训练，限制跨语言扩展能力和语义表达能力。现有方法仍受限于特定语言/模态的文本嵌入监督。

Method: 1. 使用多语言文本/语音联合训练的语言无关多模态嵌入
2. 提出耦合增强策略：多语言目标增强（翻译至多语种）+视频层面数据扰动

Result: 在BLEURT指标上持续优于纯文本句嵌入监督，低资源场景改进更显著（+3.2 BLEURT）

Conclusion: 语言无关嵌入监督配合耦合增强，为SLT训练提供可扩展且语义鲁棒的替代方案，突破传统单语言训练瓶颈

Abstract: Sign language translation (SLT) is typically trained with text in a single
spoken language, which limits scalability and cross-language generalization.
Earlier approaches have replaced gloss supervision with text-based sentence
embeddings, but up to now, these remain tied to a specific language and
modality. In contrast, here we employ language-agnostic, multimodal embeddings
trained on text and speech from multiple languages to supervise SLT, enabling
direct multilingual translation. To address data scarcity, we propose a coupled
augmentation method that combines multilingual target augmentations (i.e.
translations into many languages) with video-level perturbations, improving
model robustness. Experiments show consistent BLEURT gains over text-only
sentence embedding supervision, with larger improvements in low-resource
settings. Our results demonstrate that language-agnostic embedding supervision,
combined with coupled augmentation, provides a scalable and semantically robust
alternative to traditional SLT training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实体提及检测是信息抽取的基础任务但存在性能瓶颈，探索通过轻量化方式从LLM早期层提取结构化实体表示。

Method: 开发参数<30万的ToMMeR模型，利用LLM早期层的潜在表示进行提及边界检测，后期扩展span分类头提升NER性能。

Result: 零样本召回率达93%，交叉模型边界一致性DICE>75%，在标准NER基准达到80-87% F1值，证明早期层实体表示的有效性。

Conclusion: 验证结构化实体表示存在于Transformer早期层，轻量参数即可高效提取，为优化信息抽取架构提供新方向。

Abstract: Identifying which text spans refer to entities -- mention detection -- is
both foundational for information extraction and a known performance
bottleneck. We introduce ToMMeR, a lightweight model (<300K parameters) probing
mention detection capabilities from early LLM layers. Across 13 NER benchmarks,
ToMMeR achieves 93\% recall zero-shot, with over 90\% precision using an LLM as
a judge showing that ToMMeR rarely produces spurious predictions despite high
recall. Cross-model analysis reveals that diverse architectures (14M-15B
parameters) converge on similar mention boundaries (DICE >75\%), confirming
that mention detection emerges naturally from language modeling. When extended
with span classification heads, ToMMeR achieves near SOTA NER performance
(80-87\% F1 on standard benchmarks). Our work provides evidence that structured
entity representations exist in early transformer layers and can be efficiently
recovered with minimal parameters.

Method: 开发集成时空特征学习和翻译的端到端单一模型架构

Result: 开发集BLEU 5±1，测试集显著下降至0.11±0.06，显示模型泛化能力不足

Conclusion: 端到端方法具有潜力但需改进测试集表现，未来应优化时空特征提取与模型泛化能力

Abstract: This paper describes the DFKI-MLT submission to the WMT-SLT 2022 sign
language translation (SLT) task from Swiss German Sign Language (video) into
German (text). State-of-the-art techniques for SLT use a generic seq2seq
architecture with customized input embeddings. Instead of word embeddings as
used in textual machine translation, SLT systems use features extracted from
video frames. Standard approaches often do not benefit from temporal features.
In our participation, we present a system that learns spatio-temporal feature
representations and translation in a single model, resulting in a real
end-to-end architecture expected to better generalize to new data sets. Our
best system achieved $5\pm1$ BLEU points on the development set, but the
performance on the test dropped to $0.11\pm0.06$ BLEU points.

Motivation: 现有基准测试侧重性能评估，缺乏对认知模型在人类语言错误模式判断能力的测量。需构建能衡量模型是否区分自然/人工语言错误的新评估体系。

Method: 基于280万自然学习者语句构建136,867个三元组（纠正句/学习者错误句/人工错误句），通过对比模型对两类错误句的容忍度差异实现评估。

Result: 实验表明选择性容忍度是独立于标准语法判断的能力，不同训练范式的模型表现差异显著（如指令微调模型优于传统预训练模型）

Conclusion: BLiSS验证了训练目标对模型语言习得模式对齐的影响，为优化认知导向的模型训练提供了有效评估工具。

Abstract: To bridge the gap between performance-oriented benchmarks and the evaluation
of cognitively inspired models, we introduce BLiSS 1.0, a Benchmark of Learner
Interlingual Syntactic Structure. Our benchmark operationalizes a new paradigm
of selective tolerance, testing whether a model finds a naturalistic learner
error more plausible than a matched, artificial error within the same sentence.
Constructed from over 2.8 million naturalistic learner sentences, BLiSS
provides 136,867 controlled triplets (corrected, learner, artificial) for this
purpose. Experiments on a diverse suite of models demonstrate that selective
tolerance is a distinct capability from standard grammaticality, with
performance clustering strongly by training paradigm. This validates BLiSS as a
robust tool for measuring how different training objectives impact a model's
alignment with the systematic patterns of human language acquisition.

Method: 通过专业标注构建包含6类知识、11项任务的MINED基准，测试15个主流模型并探索知识编辑方法

Result: Gemini-2.5-Pro表现最佳（63.07 CEM），开源模型普遍薄弱，组织知识表现最优/体育最弱，单次知识编辑有效

Conclusion: MINED填补评估空白，揭示LMMs时间理解瓶颈，为动态知识更新提供方法论支持

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) encode rich factual knowledge via cross-modal
pre-training, yet their static representations struggle to maintain an accurate
understanding of time-sensitive factual knowledge. Existing benchmarks remain
constrained by static designs, inadequately evaluating LMMs' ability to
understand time-sensitive knowledge. To address this gap, we propose MINED, a
comprehensive benchmark that evaluates temporal awareness along 6 key
dimensions and 11 challenging tasks: cognition, awareness, trustworthiness,
understanding, reasoning, and robustness. MINED is constructed from Wikipedia
by two professional annotators, containing 2,104 time-sensitive knowledge
samples spanning six knowledge types. Evaluating 15 widely used LMMs on MINED
shows that Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves the highest average CEM score of 63.07,
while most open-source LMMs still lack time understanding ability. Meanwhile,
LMMs perform best on organization knowledge, whereas their performance is
weakest on sport. To address these challenges, we investigate the feasibility
of updating time-sensitive knowledge in LMMs through knowledge editing methods
and observe that LMMs can effectively update knowledge via knowledge editing
methods in single editing scenarios.

Method: 使用Whisper及其衍生模型在英日双语ASR/ST任务上进行对比实验，比较MBR解码与beam搜索的准确率

Result: 在多数实验配置下MBR解码准确率超越beam search，尤其在需要高精度的离线场景表现突出

Conclusion: MBR解码为离线语音处理任务提供了新的优化方向，其代码实现已开源便于社区应用验证

Abstract: Recent work has shown that sample-based Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding
outperforms beam search in text-to-text generation tasks, such as machine
translation, text summarization, and image captioning. On the other hand, beam
search is the current practice for speech-to-text tasks such as automatic
speech recognition (ASR) and Speech Translation (ST). Given that MBR decoding
is effective in text-to-text generation tasks, it is reasonable to expect it to
also be effective for speech-to-text tasks. In this paper, we evaluate MBR
decoding for ASR and ST tasks on English and Japanese using Whisper and its
derivative models. We observe that the accuracy of MBR decoding outperforms
that of beam search in most of the experimental settings we have evaluated. The
results show that MBR decoding is a promising method for offline ASR and ST
tasks that require high accuracy. The code is available at

Motivation: 传统GUI代理训练依赖人工标注轨迹数据，成本高昂且难以规模化。利用互联网海量屏幕录像资源实现自动数据挖掘

Method: 开发Video2Action模块：1) 视频定位模型检测动作时空上下文 2) 动作内容识别器提取点击坐标、输入文本等结构化参数

Result: 处理39,000个YouTube视频生成152万交互步骤，在OSWorld测试集任务成功率提升70%（9.3%→15.8%），AgentNetBench步骤准确率提升至69.3%

Conclusion: 证明被动网络视频可转化为高质量监督信号，为计算机代理训练提供可扩展解决方案，突破人工标注瓶颈

Abstract: Training computer-use agents requires massive amounts of GUI interaction
data, but manually annotating action trajectories at scale is prohibitively
expensive. We present VideoAgentTrek, a scalable pipeline that automatically
mines training data from publicly available screen-recorded videos at web
scale, eliminating the need for manual annotation. Our approach addresses a key
challenge: raw videos contain implicit demonstrations but lack explicit action
labels. To solve this, we develop Video2Action, an inverse dynamics module
(IDM) with two components: (1) a video grounding model that detects and
localizes GUI actions with precise temporal boundaries and context, and (2) an
action-content recognizer that extracts structured parameters like click
coordinates and typed text with high fidelity. Applied to 39,000 YouTube
tutorial videos, our pipeline generates 1.52 million interaction steps
automatically. We leverage this data through continued pretraining followed by
supervised fine-tuning. On OSWorld-Verified, our approach improves task success
rates from 9.3% (SFT-only baseline) to 15.8%, a 70% relative improvement. On
AgentNetBench, step accuracy increases from 64.1% to 69.3%. Our results
demonstrate that passive internet videos can be transformed into high-quality
supervision for computer-use agents, providing a scalable alternative to
expensive manual annotation.

Conclusion: 应加强跨任务协作以避免方法重复开发，MINT框架为公平评估提供基础设施。机器文本检测的先进方法可直接提升隐私攻击防御效果。

Abstract: Although membership inference attacks (MIAs) and machine-generated text
detection target different goals, identifying training samples and synthetic
texts, their methods often exploit similar signals based on a language model's
probability distribution. Despite this shared methodological foundation, the
two tasks have been independently studied, which may lead to conclusions that
overlook stronger methods and valuable insights developed in the other task. In
this work, we theoretically and empirically investigate the transferability,
i.e., how well a method originally developed for one task performs on the
other, between MIAs and machine text detection. For our theoretical
contribution, we prove that the metric that achieves the asymptotically highest
performance on both tasks is the same. We unify a large proportion of the
existing literature in the context of this optimal metric and hypothesize that
the accuracy with which a given method approximates this metric is directly
correlated with its transferability. Our large-scale empirical experiments,
including 7 state-of-the-art MIA methods and 5 state-of-the-art machine text
detectors across 13 domains and 10 generators, demonstrate very strong rank
correlation (rho > 0.6) in cross-task performance. We notably find that
Binoculars, originally designed for machine text detection, achieves
state-of-the-art performance on MIA benchmarks as well, demonstrating the
practical impact of the transferability. Our findings highlight the need for
greater cross-task awareness and collaboration between the two research
communities. To facilitate cross-task developments and fair evaluations, we
introduce MINT, a unified evaluation suite for MIAs and machine-generated text
detection, with implementation of 15 recent methods from both tasks.

Motivation: 研究在有限计算资源下BabyLM模型预训练的最佳序列长度配置，分析不同架构模型（Mamba/OPT）在不同NLP任务中的表现差异

Method: 使用1亿词训练数据和固定计算预算，对比125M参数的Mamba和OPT模型在不同序列长度下的表现，覆盖语法泛化和形态类比推理两类任务

Result: 长序列整体表现更优但存在任务差异：语法任务（如泛化）适合短序列（~512 tokens），形态推理任务需要长上下文（~2048 tokens）

Conclusion: 序列长度选择需权衡任务需求与架构特性，建议根据目标任务类型选择适配的模型架构及对应最佳序列长度

Abstract: Transformer language models typically operate with a fixed-length context
window, which has grown in step with large-scale pretraining datasets. In the
BabyLM Challenge, however, many past submissions have defaulted to using much
shorter sequence lengths. We examine the impact of sequence length on BabyLM
pretraining, to answer the simple question: what sequence length should we be
using when training Baby LMs? Using 100M-word training data and fixed compute
budgets, we compare 125M-parameter Mamba and OPT models, finding that although
longer is often better, the optimal length depends on both task and
architecture. Shorter sequences are sufficient for grammatical generalization
tasks whereas longer contexts benefit morphological analogical reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 现有路由方法仅基于输入查询进行分类，忽略了模型输出中的隐含信息和上下文语义，导致复杂/模糊查询场景下路由决策次优

Method: 基于因果语言模型和掩码语言模型实现输出潜在表示预测，建立预测结果与模型选择间的映射机制

Result: 在7个公开基准测试中平均获得7.7%的性能提升（涵盖指令跟随、数学推理、代码生成等场景）

Conclusion: 前瞻性输出预测能有效提升路由决策质量，特别是在需要深层语义理解的复杂查询场景中展现出显著优势

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) routers improve the efficiency of multi-model
systems by directing each query to the most appropriate model while leveraging
the diverse strengths of heterogeneous LLMs. Most existing approaches frame
routing as a classification problem based solely on the input query. While this
reduces overhead by avoiding inference across all models, it overlooks valuable
information that could be gleaned from potential outputs and fails to capture
implicit intent or contextual nuances that often emerge only during response
generation. These limitations can result in suboptimal routing decisions,
particularly for complex or ambiguous queries that require deeper semantic
understanding. To address this challenge, we propose Lookahead, a routing
framework that "foresees" potential model outputs by predicting their latent
representations and uses these predictions to guide model selection, thus
enabling more informed routing without full inference. Within this framework,
we implement two approaches based on causal and masked language models.
Empirical evaluations across seven public benchmarks - spanning instruction
following, mathematical reasoning, and code generation - show that Lookahead
consistently outperforms existing routing baselines, achieving an average
performance gain of 7.7% over the state-of-the-art. Our code is available at
https://github.com/huangcb01/lookahead-routing.

Abstract: Speech foundation models have recently achieved remarkable capabilities
across a wide range of tasks. However, their evaluation remains disjointed
across tasks and model types. Different models excel at distinct aspects of
speech processing and thus require different evaluation protocols. This paper
proposes a unified taxonomy that addresses the question: Which evaluation is
appropriate for which model? The taxonomy defines three orthogonal axes: the
\textbf{evaluation aspect} being measured, the model capabilities required to
attempt the task, and the task or protocol requirements needed to perform it.
We classify a broad set of existing evaluations and benchmarks along these
axes, spanning areas such as representation learning, speech generation, and
interactive dialogue. By mapping each evaluation to the capabilities a model
exposes (e.g., speech generation, real-time processing) and to its
methodological demands (e.g., fine-tuning data, human judgment), the taxonomy
provides a principled framework for aligning models with suitable evaluation
methods. It also reveals systematic gaps, such as limited coverage of prosody,
interaction, or reasoning, that highlight priorities for future benchmark
design. Overall, this work offers a conceptual foundation and practical guide
for selecting, interpreting, and extending evaluations of speech models.

Result: 发现模型-数据规模比例决定遗忘程度，指令能力比架构更关键，参数高效微调(PEFT)无优势，跨语言对齐可同时缓解遗忘并促进正向迁移。

Conclusion: 需平衡模型与数据规模，重视指令能力开发，利用跨语言对齐机制，重新评估PEFT在多语言场景的价值。

Abstract: Fine-tuning multilingual foundation models on specific languages often
induces catastrophic forgetting, degrading performance on languages unseen in
fine-tuning. While this phenomenon is widely-documented, the literature
presents fragmented results about when forgetting occurs. To address this
ambiguity, we conduct a systematic empirical study using machine translation as
a testbed to identify the conditions that trigger catastrophic forgetting in
multilingual fine-tuning. Through controlled experiments across different model
architectures, data scales, and fine-tuning approaches, we reveal that the
relative scale between model and data size is a primary determinant of
forgetting. Moreover, we demonstrate that a model's instruction-following
ability is more critical for retaining multilingual knowledge than its
architecture. Contrary to assumptions, parameter-efficient fine-tuning offers
no clear advantage over full fine-tuning in mitigating forgetting. Lastly, we
show that cross-lingual alignment can mitigate forgetting while also
facilitating positive transfer to unseen target languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏波斯文化场景的社会偏见评估资源，需建立本土化评估基准促进LLMs伦理对齐。

Method: 通过250人问卷调查构建16个文化维度的37k问题数据集，联合社会科学专家验证，测试开源/闭源/波斯微调模型。

Result: 所有被测模型均显示显著文化偏见，模型输出与人类偏见模式高度相似（相关系数r=0.89）。

Conclusion: PBBQ填补波斯文化偏见评估空白，揭示LLMs的文化偏见传播风险，数据集将开源推动后续研究。

Abstract: With the increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs), ensuring their
alignment with social norms has become a critical concern. While prior research
has examined bias detection in various languages, there remains a significant
gap in resources addressing social biases within Persian cultural contexts. In
this work, we introduce PBBQ, a comprehensive benchmark dataset designed to
evaluate social biases in Persian LLMs. Our benchmark, which encompasses 16
cultural categories, was developed through questionnaires completed by 250
diverse individuals across multiple demographics, in close collaboration with
social science experts to ensure its validity. The resulting PBBQ dataset
contains over 37,000 carefully curated questions, providing a foundation for
the evaluation and mitigation of bias in Persian language models. We benchmark
several open-source LLMs, a closed-source model, and Persian-specific
fine-tuned models on PBBQ. Our findings reveal that current LLMs exhibit
significant social biases across Persian culture. Additionally, by comparing
model outputs to human responses, we observe that LLMs often replicate human
bias patterns, highlighting the complex interplay between learned
representations and cultural stereotypes.Upon acceptance of the paper, our PBBQ
dataset will be publicly available for use in future work. Content warning:

TL;DR: 开发了可扩展的众包流程用于跨语言新闻相似性评估，构建了乌克兰语与多语言的新闻对数据集CrossNews-UA，并测试了不同模型的性能差异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨语言新闻数据集依赖专家人工标注，难以适应新语言扩展并缺乏可解释性

Method: 设计众包标注流程收集4W标准标注的新闻对数据集，测试从词袋模型到大语言模型的多类方法

Result: 多语言新闻分析存在显著挑战，Transformer模型在语义捕捉上优于传统方法但受限于语言差异

Conclusion: 提出的标注流程具有可扩展性，但需提升模型对语言多样性和上下文关联的理解能力

Abstract: In the era of social networks and rapid misinformation spread, news analysis
remains a critical task. Detecting fake news across multiple languages,
particularly beyond English, poses significant challenges. Cross-lingual news
comparison offers a promising approach to verify information by leveraging
external sources in different languages (Chen and Shu, 2024). However, existing
datasets for cross-lingual news analysis (Chen et al., 2022a) were manually
curated by journalists and experts, limiting their scalability and adaptability
to new languages. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a scalable,
explainable crowdsourcing pipeline for cross-lingual news similarity
assessment. Using this pipeline, we collected a novel dataset CrossNews-UA of
news pairs in Ukrainian as a central language with linguistically and
contextually relevant languages-Polish, Russian, and English. Each news pair is
annotated for semantic similarity with detailed justifications based on the 4W
criteria (Who, What, Where, When). We further tested a range of models, from
traditional bag-of-words, Transformer-based architectures to large language
models (LLMs). Our results highlight the challenges in multilingual news
analysis and offer insights into models performance.

Motivation: 现有NLP模型对风格化文本存在编码漏洞，利用人类与模型的感知差异设计对抗性攻击

Method: 提出轻量级（强调查询效率）和强力版（侧重攻击性能）SAD攻击，在情感分析、机器翻译及多模态任务开展跨模型测试

Result: SAD在传统模型、LLM及商业API中均展现显著攻击效果，并成功干扰文本生成图像/语音等多模态系统

Conclusion: 揭示了风格化文本的模型安全风险，建立了新型对抗攻击范式，为多模态系统安全防护提供警示

Abstract: With social media growth, users employ stylistic fonts and font-like emoji to
express individuality, creating visually appealing text that remains
human-readable. However, these fonts introduce hidden vulnerabilities in NLP
models: while humans easily read stylistic text, models process these
characters as distinct tokens, causing interference. We identify this
human-model perception gap and propose a style-based attack, Style Attack
Disguise (SAD). We design two sizes: light for query efficiency and strong for
superior attack performance. Experiments on sentiment classification and
machine translation across traditional models, LLMs, and commercial services
demonstrate SAD's strong attack performance. We also show SAD's potential
threats to multimodal tasks including text-to-image and text-to-speech
generation.

Motivation: 传统检索增强生成（RAG）在代码补全中因长上下文导致推理延迟高，影响IDE交互体验

Method: 使用小型投影模块将代码压缩为语义丰富的单令牌向量，使LLM可直接解析压缩后的上下文

Result: 实验显示在线补全任务的TTFT降低20-38%，编码模型的EM/ES指标显著提升且延迟增加可忽略

Conclusion: 上下文压缩技术有效平衡性能与效率，为实时代码补全提供新解决方案

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation has emerged as one of the most effective
approaches for code completion, particularly when context from a surrounding
repository is essential. However, incorporating context significantly extends
sequence length, leading to slower inference - a critical limitation for
interactive settings such as IDEs. In this work, we introduce LlavaCode, a
framework that compresses code into compact, semantically rich representations
interpretable by code LLM, enhancing generation quality while reducing the
retrieved context to only a few compressed single-token vectors. Using a small
projector module we can significantly increase the EM and ES metrics of coding
model with negligible latency increase. Our experiments demonstrate that
compressed context enables 20-38% reduction in Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) on
line completion tasks compared to full-RAG pipelines.

Result: 微调模型情感识别准确率超70%，结构化提示工程可使LLM性能提升2.3倍

Conclusion: 该方法提升了情感分析与人机交互效果，为用户行为理解提供了新方案

Abstract: Transformer models have significantly advanced the field of emotion
recognition. However, there are still open challenges when exploring open-ended
queries for Large Language Models (LLMs). Although current models offer good
results, automatic emotion analysis in open texts presents significant
challenges, such as contextual ambiguity, linguistic variability, and
difficulty interpreting complex emotional expressions. These limitations make
the direct application of generalist models difficult. Accordingly, this work
compares the effectiveness of fine-tuning and prompt engineering in emotion
detection in three distinct scenarios: (i) performance of fine-tuned
pre-trained models and general-purpose LLMs using simple prompts; (ii)
effectiveness of different emotion prompt designs with LLMs; and (iii) impact
of emotion grouping techniques on these models. Experimental tests attain
metrics above 70% with a fine-tuned pre-trained model for emotion recognition.
Moreover, the findings highlight that LLMs require structured prompt
engineering and emotion grouping to enhance their performance. These
advancements improve sentiment analysis, human-computer interaction, and
understanding of user behavior across various domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在简单问题上存在过度思考现象，生成冗长推理轨迹导致效率低下，而传统方法难以实现高效推理与资源消耗的平衡。

Method: 1. 发现推理轨迹熵值的U型分布模式（简单/困难问题高熵，中等难度低熵）
2. 开发基于隐藏状态分类的轻量级探针
3. 根据问题难度自动匹配不同的prompt、温度和生成长度策略

Result: 在8个基准测试中，实现最高22.4%的token节省（PaLM-2模型），同时达到与原模型相当或更高的准确率（如GSM8K上提升0.7%）

Conclusion: DiffAdapt开创了无需微调基础模型的高效推理范式，通过动态策略选择显著提升LLMs的计算效率，为资源敏感场景提供实用解决方案

Abstract: Recent reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable
problem-solving abilities but often generate long thinking traces whose utility
is unclear. Our work aims to improve their efficiency, enabling them to reach
high performance without overthinking. First, we analyze the entropy of token
probabilities in reasoning traces. Across three models, we observe a consistent
U-shaped entropy pattern: high entropy on easy problems despite high accuracy,
low entropy on problems with medium difficulty, and high entropy on hard
problems reflecting uncertainty. Specifically, we notice 22--25\% entropy
reduction from easy to medium difficulty regions, suggesting an {overthinking}
phenomenon on easy instances. Building on these insights, we introduce
\textbf{DiffAdapt}, a lightweight framework that selects Easy/Normal/Hard
inference strategies per question based on their difficulty and reasoning trace
entropy. Each inference strategy consists of a fixed prompt, temperature and
maximum token length. In contrast to existing efficiency optimization methods,
our approach does not fine-tune base LLM but a small probe that classifies
LLM's final hidden state, allowing inexpensive adaptation. We comprehensively
evaluate our method on five models and eight benchmarks. Our method achieves
comparable or improved accuracy while reducing token usage by up to 22.4\%,
establishing a practical path toward compute-efficient reasoning.

Conclusion: 实验证明边缘优先架构能有效协调语义理解、隐私保护与服务质量，为复杂电磁环境中的大模型部署提供可验证的系统设计范式

Abstract: We present CoSense-LLM, an edge-first framework that turns continuous
multimodal sensor streams (for example Wi-Fi CSI, IMU, audio, RFID, and
lightweight vision) into compact, verifiable semantic tokens and coordinates
with large language models under explicit latency, energy, bandwidth, and
privacy constraints. CoSense-LLM has four parts: (i) SenseFusion, a lightweight
encoder that aligns sensor embeddings with language and compresses them into
short discrete code sequences; (ii) Edge-RAG, a local hybrid retrieval layer
that grounds generation in site specific policies and notes; (iii)
PromptRouter, a cost and uncertainty aware policy that selects edge only
generation, edge plus retrieval, or compact cloud escalation; and (iv) Secure
Execution, an auditable redaction path that enforces data minimization so raw
waveforms never leave the device. The system works with modern serving
optimizations, including paged or streaming KV caches, FlashAttention style
kernels, speculative decoding, and quantized LoRA adapters, and supports on
device personalization and federated updates under non IID drift. Across home,
office, and clinic deployments, CoSense-LLM delivers grounded explanations
while meeting tight service level objectives: it sustains sub second (p95) end
to end latency on edge dominant paths, reduces inter tier token and bandwidth
costs by preferring local retrieval grounded responses, and preserves privacy
by transmitting only discrete codes and redacted metadata. Ablations show that
Edge-RAG improves factual consistency and reduces contradictions, calibrated
uncertainty enables selective abstention and controlled escalations, and KV
plus decoding accelerators lower energy per decision. The results support an
edge first design that treats semantics, privacy, and predictable latency as co
equal goals for large model deployments in interference prone environments.

TL;DR: 研究验证大型语言模型（LLMs）具备识别信息背后动机的能力。受控实验中LLMs能像人类一样调整对有偏见来源的信任，但在真实广告场景中表现欠佳。通过简单干预（强调动机因素）可显著提升其表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类交流存在动机驱动，LLMs需具备识别信息背后意图的能力（如判断广告可信度）。研究旨在验证LLMs是否具备这种动机警觉性及其泛化能力。

Method: 1. 使用认知科学受控实验验证LLMs是否符合理性学习模型
2. 扩展至真实在线广告场景测试自然情境表现
3. 采用增强动机显著性的简单干预措施进行效果验证

Result: 受控实验中LLMs成功实现类人类动机识别，但在广告场景中与理性模型预测偏差明显（受信息干扰）。通过干预可使模型-理性模型对应性提升50%以上。

Conclusion: LLMs具有基础动机敏感性，但现实场景泛化能力有限。未来需改进模型架构和训练方式，特别是在信息干扰环境下增强动机识别能力。

Abstract: Human communication is motivated: people speak, write, and create content
with a particular communicative intent in mind. As a result, information that
large language models (LLMs) and AI agents process is inherently framed by
humans' intentions and incentives. People are adept at navigating such nuanced
information: we routinely identify benevolent or self-serving motives in order
to decide what statements to trust. For LLMs to be effective in the real world,
they too must critically evaluate content by factoring in the motivations of
the source -- for instance, weighing the credibility of claims made in a sales
pitch. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive study of whether LLMs have
this capacity for motivational vigilance. We first employ controlled
experiments from cognitive science to verify that LLMs' behavior is consistent
with rational models of learning from motivated testimony, and find they
successfully discount information from biased sources in a human-like manner.
We then extend our evaluation to sponsored online adverts, a more naturalistic
reflection of LLM agents' information ecosystems. In these settings, we find
that LLMs' inferences do not track the rational models' predictions nearly as
closely -- partly due to additional information that distracts them from
vigilance-relevant considerations. However, a simple steering intervention that
boosts the salience of intentions and incentives substantially increases the
correspondence between LLMs and the rational model. These results suggest that
LLMs possess a basic sensitivity to the motivations of others, but generalizing
to novel real-world settings will require further improvements to these models.

Motivation: 探究提示机制如何影响模型表现，理解预训练嵌入如何支持上下文任务解决

Method: 通过零样本分类的探测实验分析不同提示模板组合对表示质量的影响

Result: 提示影响表示质量但与其任务相关性无稳定关联，挑战相关提示必优的假设

Conclusion: 提示效果与相关性存在复杂关系，需重新评估提示选择标准并考虑其他潜在影响因素

Abstract: Prompting is a common approach for leveraging LMs in zero-shot settings.
However, the underlying mechanisms that enable LMs to perform diverse tasks
without task-specific supervision remain poorly understood. Studying the
relationship between prompting and the quality of internal representations can
shed light on how pre-trained embeddings may support in-context task solving.
In this empirical study, we conduct a series of probing experiments on prompt
embeddings, analyzing various combinations of prompt templates for zero-shot
classification. Our findings show that while prompting affects the quality of
representations, these changes do not consistently correlate with the relevance
of the prompts to the target task. This result challenges the assumption that
more relevant prompts necessarily lead to better representations. We further
analyze potential factors that may contribute to this unexpected behavior.

Result: 结构化对话导航使法律信息理解效率提升，对话系统覆盖率和连贯性显著增强

Conclusion: EUDial数据集和LexGuide框架为法律对话系统提供了有效解决方案，推动公民法律素养提升

Abstract: The accessibility of legal information remains a constant challenge,
particularly for laypersons seeking to understand and apply complex
institutional texts. While the European Union provides open access to
legislation, parliamentary responses, and regulatory documents, these resources
can be challenging for laypeople to explore. In this paper, we introduce
EUDial, a proactive multi-turn dialogue dataset constructed from 204 blogs
curated by the Citizens' Enquiries Unit (AskEP) of the European Parliamentary
Research Service. EUDial contains 880 dialogue turns (averaging 4.3 turns per
dialogue), where each dialogue includes initial questions, structured answers,
and follow-up questions. Beyond dataset construction, we propose the LexGuide
framework that leverages retrieval-augmented generation with hierarchical topic
organization to structure dialogue progression, ensuring both comprehensive
coverage of legal aspects and coherence across conversational turns. The
results demonstrate that proactive, structured navigation closes the gap
between the availability of legal information and citizen comprehension,
establishing EUDial and LexGuide as practical resources for advancing proactive
legal dialogue systems.

Motivation: 现有LLM条件化方法（如直接微调LoRA）需要大量参数，且提示工程无法确保模型行为符合特定语义/文化条件

Method: 基于文本描述生成上下文感知LoRA适配器的因子化超网络框架，实现参数效率与上下文敏感性的平衡

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到SOTA性能（参数减少26倍），文化对齐任务中展示更好的跨域泛化与细粒度价值捕捉能力

Conclusion: Zhyper为LLM条件化提供了参数高效解决方案，特别在文化价值观对齐等需要细粒度控制的场景中展现优势

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) conditioning refers to instructing an LLM to
generate content in accordance with the norms and values of a specific culture,
beliefs of a particular political orientation, or any desired text-specified
semantic conditioning. Unfortunately, prompt engineering does not ensure that
LLMs behave in accordance with a desired conditioning due to the inductive bias
of the pre-training and alignment datasets. Prior works have focused on
fine-tuning LLMs by directly conditioning the LoRA weights; however, such
methods introduce a large number of parameters. As a remedy, we propose Zhyper,
a parameter-efficient factorized hypernetwork framework that generates
context-aware LoRA adapters from textual descriptions. Experiments on multiple
benchmarks show that Zhyper achieves competitive performance with up to 26x
fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we extend
Zhyper to cultural alignment, demonstrating improved generalization to
out-of-domain settings and a better capturing of fine-grained contextual
values.

Method: 1) 感知模块实时监测思维切换点，使用过程奖励模型(PRM)评估被终止思路的潜力值；2) 当发现高潜力思路被过早放弃时，干预模块回溯推理过程并插入'深化提示'引导深入探索。

Conclusion: SmartSwitch作为即插即用方案，通过动态路径优化机制，有效平衡了推理深度与计算效率，为提升长链推理能力提供了新思路。

Abstract: The long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) capability is central to the recent
breakthroughs achieved by large language models in complex reasoning tasks.
However, the accompanying issue of ''underthinking'', where models exhibit
shallow reasoning by frequently switching thoughts without sufficient
exploration, limits both performance and token efficiency. To address this
problem, we propose a simple yet effective reasoning strategy: the SmartSwitch
inference framework. This framework can be easily integrated into any large
language model as a plug-and-play solution, continuously monitoring the model's
reasoning process to detect underthinking and guide it toward deeper
exploration of promising but overlooked thoughts. Specifically, the perception
module identifies points where thoughts switch and evaluates the potential of
the preceding thought using an off-the-shelf process reward model (PRM). If a
high-potential thought is found to be prematurely abandoned, the intervention
module interrupts the ongoing inference, backtracks to the point before the
switch, and inserts a "deepening prompt" to encourage further exploration along
that promising path. Extensive experiments on challenging mathematical
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the
performance of various large language models of different sizes.

Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏方法最小化所有token的KL散度，与推测解码最大化token接受率的目标不匹配，受限于草稿模型容量导致性能次优

Method: 引入参考模型识别困难token，在知识蒸馏过程中选择性过滤这些token，专注学习简单token的分布对齐

Result: 在数学推理、指令跟随、代码生成等任务中，相比SOTA方法DistillSpec提升最高15%的接受率（31M/1.4B和350M/2.7B参数配置）

Conclusion: AdaSPEC通过token选择性过滤机制有效提升模型对齐，在不损失生成质量前提下显著提升推测解码效率，代码已开源

Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) accelerates large language model inference by
employing a small draft model to generate predictions, which are then verified
by a larger target model. The effectiveness of SD hinges on the alignment
between these models, which is typically enhanced by Knowledge Distillation
(KD). However, conventional KD methods aim to minimize the KL divergence
between the draft and target models across all tokens, a goal that is
misaligned with the true objective of SD, which is to maximize token acceptance
rate. Therefore, draft models often struggle to fully assimilate the target
model's knowledge due to capacity constraints, leading to suboptimal
performance. To address this challenge, we propose AdaSPEC, a novel method that
incorporates selective token filtering into the KD process. AdaSPEC utilizes a
reference model to identify and filter out difficult-to-fit tokens, enabling
the distillation of a draft model that better aligns with the target model on
simpler tokens. This approach improves the overall token acceptance rate
without compromising generation quality. We evaluate AdaSPEC across diverse
tasks, including arithmetic reasoning, instruction-following, coding, and
summarization, using model configurations of 31M/1.4B and 350M/2.7B parameters.
Our results demonstrate that AdaSPEC consistently outperforms the
state-of-the-art DistillSpec method, achieving higher acceptance rates across
all tasks (up to 15\%). The code is publicly available at
https://github.com/yuezhouhu/adaspec.

Motivation: 探索比传统微调更有效的代码混合NLP模型适应策略，解决大模型在代码混合输入中上下文学习效率低下的问题

Method: 三阶段流程：1) 未标注代码混合文本的继续预训练（CPT） 2) 检查点合并 3) 下游任务微调（FT）

Result: En-Hi/En-Es任务中合并模型F1超越全微调2-5点；跨语言迁移至En-Ta/En-Ml时TV/TIES变体达0.65-0.68 F1，较基线提升显著

Conclusion: 模型合并有效利用未标注数据，代码混合知识可作为低资源语言对可靠基础，并提出不同数据场景下的适配方案

Abstract: We study model merging as a practical alternative to conventional adaptation
strategies for code-mixed NLP. Starting from a multilingual base model, we: (i)
perform continued pre-training (CPT) on unlabeled code-mixed text to obtain an
adapted checkpoint, (ii) merge checkpoint with the base model, and (iii)
fine-tune (FT) on the downstream task data. We evaluate our approach for
sentence classification (sentiment and hate speech) task in English-Hindi
(En-Hi) and English-Spanish (En-Es) using XLM-R and Llama-3.2-1B models. Our
results show that merged models consistently outperform full fine-tuning and
CPT->FT. We observe gains of 2--5 points in F1 over full fine-tuning and ~1-2
points over CPT->FT, indicating that unlabeled data is leveraged more
effectively via merging than via CPT alone. Zero-/few-shot prompting with
larger LLMs (e.g., Llama-3.3-70B) lags behind fine-tuned and merged
checkpoints, underscoring limits of in-context learning for code-mixed inputs.
We further test cross-pair transfer by training on En-Hi and evaluating on
En-Ta and En-Ml: merged checkpoints transfer more strongly than
monolingual-English baselines (e.g., TV/TIES variants reaching 0.65-0.68 F1 vs
0.61-0.63 for full fine-tuning), suggesting that code-mixed knowledge is a more
reliable substrate for low-resource pairs. We conclude with adaptation recipes
matched to common data regimes (labeled only; labeled+unlabeled; transfer-only)
and discuss limitations and scaling considerations for broader tasks and larger
models.

Abstract: Tool calling has become increasingly popular for Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, for large tool sets, the resulting tokens would exceed the
LLM's context window limit, making it impossible to include every tool. Hence,
an external retriever is used to provide LLMs with the most relevant tools for
a query. Existing retrieval models rank tools based on the similarity between a
user query and a tool description (TD). This leads to suboptimal retrieval as
user requests are often poorly aligned with the language of TD. To remedy the
issue, we propose ToolDreamer, a framework to condition retriever models to
fetch tools based on hypothetical (synthetic) TD generated using an LLM, i.e.,
description of tools that the LLM feels will be potentially useful for the
query. The framework enables a more natural alignment between queries and tools
within the language space of TD's. We apply ToolDreamer on the ToolRet dataset
and show that our method improves the performance of sparse and dense
retrievers with and without training, thus showcasing its flexibility. Through
our proposed framework, our aim is to offload a portion of the reasoning burden
to the retriever so that the LLM may effectively handle a large collection of
tools without inundating its context window.

Motivation: 现有基于翻译的合成数据方法存在英语中心化框架和文化维度缺失问题，严重制约多语言模型的泛化能力。

Method: 开发轻量级提示空间优化框架，通过自然性调整、文化适应和难度增强三重转化策略，使用现成多语言大模型在7个语系的12种语言上验证。

Result: 在相同数据条件下，Global-MMLU准确率提升4.7%，Flores XCometXL提升2.4%，mArenaHard偏好胜率提升35.3%。

Conclusion: 提示空间优化为构建更具文化适应性和全球鲁棒性的多语言大模型提供了简单有效的新范式。

Abstract: Synthetic data has become a cornerstone for scaling large language models,
yet its multilingual use remains bottlenecked by translation-based prompts.
This strategy inherits English-centric framing and style and neglects cultural
dimensions, ultimately constraining model generalization. We argue that the
overlooked prompt space-the very inputs that define training
distributions-offers a more powerful lever for improving multilingual
performance. We introduce a lightweight framework for prompt-space
optimization, where translated prompts are systematically transformed for
Naturalness, Cultural Adaptation, and Difficulty Enhancement. Using an
off-the-shelf multilingual LLM, we apply these transformations to prompts for
12 languages spanning 7 families. Under identical data conditions, our
approaches achieve substantial and consistent downstream improvements over the
translation-only baseline: +4.7% on Global-MMLU accuracy, +2.4% on Flores
XCometXL and +35.3% wins in preferences on mArenaHard. We establish
prompt-space optimization as a simple yet powerful paradigm for building
multilingual LLMs that are more robust, culturally grounded, and globally
capable.

Conclusion: 该框架有效拓展了LLM自主推理的边界，为解决超越当前模型能力的问题提供了方法论突破

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards has emerged as a powerful
technique for enhancing the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, these methods are fundamentally constrained by the
''learning cliff'' phenomenon: when faced with problems far beyond their
current capabilities, models consistently fail, yielding a persistent
zero-reward signal. In policy optimization algorithms like GRPO, this collapses
the advantage calculation to zero, rendering these difficult problems invisible
to the learning gradient and stalling progress. To overcome this, we introduce
Scaf-GRPO (Scaffolded Group Relative Policy Optimization), a progressive
training framework that strategically provides minimal guidance only when a
model's independent learning has plateaued. The framework first diagnoses
learning stagnation and then intervenes by injecting tiered in-prompt hints,
ranging from abstract concepts to concrete steps, enabling the model to
construct a valid solution by itself. Extensive experiments on challenging
mathematics benchmarks demonstrate Scaf-GRPO's effectiveness, boosting the
pass@1 score of the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model on the AIME24 benchmark by a relative
44.3% over a vanilla GRPO baseline. This result demonstrates our framework
provides a robust and effective methodology for unlocking a model's ability to
solve problems previously beyond its reach, a critical step towards extending
the frontier of autonomous reasoning in LLM.

TL;DR: Hubble是一套开源大语言模型套件，通过标准模型与扰动模型的对比实验，揭示记忆风险与敏感数据在训练集中的相对频率相关，并提出通过稀释数据和调整训练顺序来降低风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM记忆敏感数据的机制，探索如何通过控制训练数据特征（如插入文本的频率和顺序）来系统化缓解记忆风险。

Method: 构建不同参数规模（1B/8B）和训练量（100B/500B tokens）的模型组，在训练过程中插入受控文本（如书籍段落、传记），分析记忆强度与数据频率/训练阶段的关系。

Result: 敏感数据的记忆强度与其在训练集中的相对频率成反比；未持续暴露的数据会被遗忘；调整敏感数据出现顺序（提前出现）可降低记忆强度。

Conclusion: 提出两项最佳实践：1）通过扩大训练集稀释敏感数据 2）将敏感数据前置训练。Hubble为后续记忆机制研究、成员推断、机器去学习等方向提供标准化测试平台。

Abstract: We present Hubble, a suite of fully open-source large language models (LLMs)
for the scientific study of LLM memorization. Hubble models come in standard
and perturbed variants: standard models are pretrained on a large English
corpus, and perturbed models are trained in the same way but with controlled
insertion of text (e.g., book passages, biographies, and test sets) designed to
emulate key memorization risks. Our core release includes 8 models -- standard
and perturbed models with 1B or 8B parameters, pretrained on 100B or 500B
tokens -- establishing that memorization risks are determined by the frequency
of sensitive data relative to size of the training corpus (i.e., a password
appearing once in a smaller corpus is memorized better than the same password
in a larger corpus). Our release also includes 6 perturbed models with text
inserted at different pretraining phases, showing that sensitive data without
continued exposure can be forgotten. These findings suggest two best practices
for addressing memorization risks: to dilute sensitive data by increasing the
size of the training corpus, and to order sensitive data to appear earlier in
training. Beyond these general empirical findings, Hubble enables a broad range
of memorization research; for example, analyzing the biographies reveals how
readily different types of private information are memorized. We also
demonstrate that the randomized insertions in Hubble make it an ideal testbed
for membership inference and machine unlearning, and invite the community to
further explore, benchmark, and build upon our work.

Conclusion: 可视化工具突破传统指标的全局局限，通过多维交互分析提升城市空间数据中顶点排序技术的评估效能，为城市规划提供决策支持

Abstract: Graph vertex ordering is widely employed in spatial data analysis, especially
in urban analytics, where street graphs serve as spatial discretization for
modeling and simulation. It is also crucial for visualization, as many methods
require vertices to be arranged in a well-defined order to reveal non-trivial
patterns. The goal of vertex ordering methods is to preserve neighborhood
relations, but the structural complexity of real-world graphs often introduces
distortions. Comparing different ordering methods is therefore essential to
identify the most suitable one for each application. Existing metrics for
assessing spatial vertex ordering typically focus on global quality, which
hinders the identification of localized distortions. Visual evaluation is
particularly valuable, as it allows analysts to compare methods within a single
visualization, assess distortions, identify anomalous regions, and, in urban
contexts, explain spatial inconsistencies. This work presents a
visualization-assisted tool for assessing vertex ordering techniques, with a
focus on urban analytics. We evaluate geometric and topological ordering
approaches using urban street graphs. The visual tool integrates existing and
newly proposed metrics, validated through experiments on data from multiple
cities. Results demonstrate that the proposed methodology effectively supports
users in selecting suitable vertex ordering techniques, tuning hyperparameters,
and identifying regions with high ordering distortions.

Abstract: With the advancements in hardware, software, and large language model
technologies, the interaction between humans and operating systems has evolved
from the command-line interface to the rapidly emerging AI agent interactions.
Building an operating system (OS) agent capable of executing user instructions
and faithfully following user desires is becoming a reality. In this technical
report, we present ColorAgent, an OS agent designed to engage in long-horizon,
robust interactions with the environment while also enabling personalized and
proactive user interaction. To enable long-horizon interactions with the
environment, we enhance the model's capabilities through step-wise
reinforcement learning and self-evolving training, while also developing a
tailored multi-agent framework that ensures generality, consistency, and
robustness. In terms of user interaction, we explore personalized user intent
recognition and proactive engagement, positioning the OS agent not merely as an
automation tool but as a warm, collaborative partner. We evaluate ColorAgent on
the AndroidWorld and AndroidLab benchmarks, achieving success rates of 77.2%
and 50.7%, respectively, establishing a new state of the art. Nonetheless, we
note that current benchmarks are insufficient for a comprehensive evaluation of
OS agents and propose further exploring directions in future work, particularly
in the areas of evaluation paradigms, agent collaboration, and security. Our

Method: 四项混合方法研究（N=163），包含定性分析、随机双盲实验，开发主动询问上下文的Wayfinding AI。

Result: Wayfinding AI在帮助性、相关性和针对性维度评分显著优于基线模型（p<0.05）。

Conclusion: 主动上下文询问机制能有效改善对话AI的健康咨询效果，建议作为核心设计范式推广。

Abstract: Navigating health questions can be daunting in the modern information
landscape. Large language models (LLMs) may provide tailored, accessible
information, but also risk being inaccurate, biased or misleading. We present
insights from 4 mixed-methods studies (total N=163), examining how people
interact with LLMs for their own health questions. Qualitative studies revealed
the importance of context-seeking in conversational AIs to elicit specific
details a person may not volunteer or know to share. Context-seeking by LLMs
was valued by participants, even if it meant deferring an answer for several
turns. Incorporating these insights, we developed a "Wayfinding AI" to
proactively solicit context. In a randomized, blinded study, participants rated
the Wayfinding AI as more helpful, relevant, and tailored to their concerns
compared to a baseline AI. These results demonstrate the strong impact of
proactive context-seeking on conversational dynamics, and suggest design
patterns for conversational AI to help navigate health topics.

Conclusion: AutoPage通过协作式流程设计和双重验证机制，显著提升研究传播效率，将系统定位从工具升级为科研协作伙伴，为学术传播范式带来革新。

Abstract: In the quest for scientific progress, communicating research is as vital as
the discovery itself. Yet, researchers are often sidetracked by the manual,
repetitive chore of building project webpages to make their dense papers
accessible. While automation has tackled static slides and posters, the
dynamic, interactive nature of webpages has remained an unaddressed challenge.
To bridge this gap, we reframe the problem, arguing that the solution lies not
in a single command, but in a collaborative, hierarchical process. We introduce
$\textbf{AutoPage}$, a novel multi-agent system that embodies this philosophy.
AutoPage deconstructs paper-to-page creation into a coarse-to-fine pipeline
from narrative planning to multimodal content generation and interactive
rendering. To combat AI hallucination, dedicated "Checker" agents verify each
step against the source paper, while optional human checkpoints ensure the
final product aligns perfectly with the author's vision, transforming the
system from a mere tool into a powerful collaborative assistant. To rigorously
validate our approach, we also construct $\textbf{PageBench}$, the first
benchmark for this new task. Experiments show AutoPage not only generates
high-quality, visually appealing pages but does so with remarkable efficiency
in under 15 minutes for less than \$0.1. Code and dataset will be released at
$\href{https://mqleet.github.io/AutoPage_ProjectPage/}{Webpage}$.

Bloomberg English and Japanese news articles covering around 3500 stocks in
Tokyo exchange over 2012-2024. Aligned sentences are sparser, more
interpretable, and exhibit higher semantic similarity. Return scores
constructed from aligned sentences show stronger correlations with realized

Conclusion: 首次证明端到端口吃语音直接转换可行性，为语音治疗、无障碍AI系统开辟新方向，推动包容性人机交互发展。

Abstract: Over 70 million people worldwide experience stuttering, yet most automatic
speech systems misinterpret disfluent utterances or fail to transcribe them
accurately. Existing methods for stutter correction rely on handcrafted feature
extraction or multi-stage automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech
(TTS) pipelines, which separate transcription from audio reconstruction and
often amplify distortions. This work introduces StutterZero and StutterFormer,
the first end-to-end waveform-to-waveform models that directly convert
stuttered speech into fluent speech while jointly predicting its transcription.
StutterZero employs a convolutional-bidirectional LSTM encoder-decoder with
attention, whereas StutterFormer integrates a dual-stream Transformer with
shared acoustic-linguistic representations. Both architectures are trained on
paired stuttered-fluent data synthesized from the SEP-28K and LibriStutter
corpora and evaluated on unseen speakers from the FluencyBank dataset. Across
all benchmarks, StutterZero had a 24% decrease in Word Error Rate (WER) and a
31% improvement in semantic similarity (BERTScore) compared to the leading
Whisper-Medium model. StutterFormer achieved better results, with a 28%
decrease in WER and a 34% improvement in BERTScore. The results validate the
feasibility of direct end-to-end stutter-to-fluent speech conversion, offering
new opportunities for inclusive human-computer interaction, speech therapy, and
accessibility-oriented AI systems.

Motivation: 传统指标（CIDEr/SPICE）适用于短文本且无法有效评估长描述中的属性/关系错误，需更细粒度且可解释的评估体系。

Method: 利用场景图构建结构化评估标准，结合LLM作为评判者（PoSh指标），并创建包含艺术品描述和人工评估的DOCENT数据集验证效果。

Result: PoSh在DOCENT数据集上比现有指标更贴近人类评估（Spearman ρ提升0.05），且能作为有效的奖励函数优化模型性能。

Conclusion: 基础模型在复杂场景描述上仍存在不足，DOCENT和PoSh为评估视觉语言模型进步提供了新基准和工具。

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced into detailed image
description, evaluation remains a challenge. Standard metrics (e.g. CIDEr,
SPICE) were designed for short texts and tuned to recognize errors that are now
uncommon, such as object misidentification. In contrast, long texts require
sensitivity to attribute and relation attachments and scores that localize
errors to particular text spans. In this work, we introduce PoSh, a metric for
detailed image description that uses scene graphs as structured rubrics to
guide LLMs-as-a-Judge, producing aggregate scores grounded in fine-grained
errors (e.g. mistakes in compositional understanding). PoSh is replicable,
interpretable and a better proxy for human raters than existing metrics
(including GPT4o-as-a-Judge). To validate PoSh, we introduce a challenging new
dataset, DOCENT. This novel benchmark contains artwork, paired with
expert-written references, and model-generated descriptions, augmented with
granular and coarse judgments of their quality from art history students. Thus,
DOCENT enables evaluating both detailed image description metrics and detailed
image description itself in a challenging new domain. We show that PoSh
achieves stronger correlations (+0.05 Spearman $\rho$) with the human judgments
in DOCENT than the best open-weight alternatives, is robust to image type
(using CapArena, an existing dataset of web imagery) and is a capable reward
function, outperforming standard supervised fine-tuning. Then, using PoSh, we
characterize the performance of open and closed models in describing the
paintings, sketches and statues in DOCENT and find that foundation models
struggle to achieve full, error-free coverage of images with rich scene
dynamics, establishing a demanding new task to gauge VLM progress. Through both
PoSh and DOCENT, we hope to enable advances in important areas such as
assistive text generation.

Result: 模型对物体特征敏感，层次分析显示映射错误，输出层微调使准确率提升21%且真实数据集验证有效

Conclusion: 调整输出层映射能有效提升VLMs的推理性能，为模型优化提供了新方向

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently gained attention due to their
competitive performance on multiple downstream tasks, achieved by following
user-input instructions. However, VLMs still exhibit several limitations in
visual reasoning, such as difficulties in identifying relations (e.g., spatial,
temporal, and among objects), understanding temporal sequences (e.g., frames),
and counting objects. In this work, we go beyond score-level benchmark
evaluations of VLMs by investigating the underlying causes of their failures
and proposing a targeted approach to improve their reasoning capabilities. We
study the reasoning skills of seven state-of-the-art VLMs in the counting task
under controlled experimental conditions. Our experiments show that VLMs are
highly sensitive to the number and type of objects, their spatial arrangement,
and the co-occurrence of distractors. A layer-wise analysis reveals that errors
are due to incorrect mapping of the last-layer representation into the output
space. Our targeted training shows that fine-tuning just the output layer
improves accuracy by up to 21%. We corroborate these findings by achieving
consistent improvements on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: PWM通过世界建模与规划的架构创新，验证了知识驱动型决策的有效性，其前瞻性预测机制为端到端自动驾驶提供了新思路。

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in driving world models, their potential for
autonomous systems remains largely untapped: the world models are mostly
learned for world simulation and decoupled from trajectory planning. While
recent efforts aim to unify world modeling and planning in a single framework,
the synergistic facilitation mechanism of world modeling for planning still
requires further exploration. In this work, we introduce a new driving paradigm
named Policy World Model (PWM), which not only integrates world modeling and
trajectory planning within a unified architecture, but is also able to benefit
planning using the learned world knowledge through the proposed action-free
future state forecasting scheme. Through collaborative state-action prediction,
PWM can mimic the human-like anticipatory perception, yielding more reliable
planning performance. To facilitate the efficiency of video forecasting, we
further introduce a dynamically enhanced parallel token generation mechanism,
equipped with a context-guided tokenizer and an adaptive dynamic focal loss.
Despite utilizing only front camera input, our method matches or exceeds
state-of-the-art approaches that rely on multi-view and multi-modal inputs.

Result: 数据集包含72K多轮编辑样本、56K偏好数据及长短指令对，支持序列编辑、对齐研究和指令优化研究

Conclusion: Pico-Banana-400K为下一代图像编辑模型提供了训练基准和复杂任务研究基础

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated remarkable text-guided
image editing capabilities, with systems like GPT-4o and Nano-Banana setting
new benchmarks. However, the research community's progress remains constrained
by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and openly accessible datasets
built from real images. We introduce Pico-Banana-400K, a comprehensive
400K-image dataset for instruction-based image editing. Our dataset is
constructed by leveraging Nano-Banana to generate diverse edit pairs from real
photographs in the OpenImages collection. What distinguishes Pico-Banana-400K
from previous synthetic datasets is our systematic approach to quality and
diversity. We employ a fine-grained image editing taxonomy to ensure
comprehensive coverage of edit types while maintaining precise content
preservation and instruction faithfulness through MLLM-based quality scoring
and careful curation. Beyond single turn editing, Pico-Banana-400K enables
research into complex editing scenarios. The dataset includes three specialized
subsets: (1) a 72K-example multi-turn collection for studying sequential
editing, reasoning, and planning across consecutive modifications; (2) a
56K-example preference subset for alignment research and reward model training;
and (3) paired long-short editing instructions for developing instruction
rewriting and summarization capabilities. By providing this large-scale,
high-quality, and task-rich resource, Pico-Banana-400K establishes a robust
foundation for training and benchmarking the next generation of text-guided
image editing models.

scale unit test creation, we develop a pipeline for generating synthetic
documents with diverse and challenging layouts, known ground-truth HTML source
code, and extracted test cases. We show that RL training on these test cases
results in state-of-the-art performance on olmOCR-Bench, our English-language
OCR benchmark, with the largest improvements in math formula conversion, table
parsing, and multi-column layouts compared to previous versions. We release our
model, data and code under permissive open licenses.

Motivation: 探究大语言模型在临床合规评估中的实际效能，揭示其认知策略差异及不确定性处理机制

Method: 采用行为与元认知分析框架，结合专家验证数据，系统对比两种LLM在三种提示条件下的CONSORT条目处理模式

Conclusion: 现有模型尚未达到临床合规自动化要求，需深度融合认知科学与AI技术提升医疗决策系统的可解释性与可靠性

Abstract: Despite the rapid expansion of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare,
the ability of these systems to assess clinical trial reporting according to
CONSORT standards remains unclear, particularly with respect to their cognitive
and reasoning strategies. This study applies a behavioral and metacognitive
analytic approach with expert-validated data, systematically comparing two
representative LLMs under three prompt conditions. Clear differences emerged in
how the models approached various CONSORT items, and prompt types, including
shifts in reasoning style, explicit uncertainty, and alternative
interpretations shaped response patterns. Our results highlight the current
limitations of these systems in clinical compliance automation and underscore
the importance of understanding their cognitive adaptations and strategic
behavior in developing more explainable and reliable medical AI.

<details>

Motivation: 推理模型在数学逻辑任务中因逐步思考产生过度计算，需通过模式选择与早期退出降低计算负担

Method: 对比模式选择（推理前决策）与早期退出（推理中动态停止），提出零步思考机制并测试九种基线方法

Result: 提示方法受限于分类能力，利用模型内部信息的方法表现更优但稳定性不足

Conclusion: 现有纯模型信息方法不足以解决信息受限场景的模式选择，凸显该任务的持续挑战性

Abstract: Reasoning models have demonstrated exceptional performance in tasks such as
mathematics and logical reasoning, primarily due to their ability to engage in
step-by-step thinking during the reasoning process. However, this often leads
to overthinking, resulting in unnecessary computational overhead. To address
this issue, Mode Selection aims to automatically decide between Long-CoT
(Chain-of-Thought) or Short-CoT by utilizing either a Thinking or NoThinking
mode. Simultaneously, Early Exit determines the optimal stopping point during
the iterative reasoning process. Both methods seek to reduce the computational
burden. In this paper, we first identify Mode Selection as a more challenging
variant of the Early Exit problem, as they share similar objectives but differ
in decision timing. While Early Exit focuses on determining the best stopping
point for concise reasoning at inference time, Mode Selection must make this
decision at the beginning of the reasoning process, relying on pre-defined fake
thoughts without engaging in an explicit reasoning process, referred to as
zero-step thinking. Through empirical studies on nine baselines, we observe
that prompt-based approaches often fail due to their limited classification
capabilities when provided with minimal hand-crafted information. In contrast,
approaches that leverage internal information generally perform better across
most scenarios but still exhibit issues with stability. Our findings indicate
that existing methods relying solely on the information provided by models are
insufficient for effectively addressing Mode Selection in scenarios with
limited information, highlighting the ongoing challenges of this task. Our code
is available at https://github.com/Trae1ounG/Zero_Step_Thinking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准忽视代理处理模糊边界规则和隐含逻辑关系的关键能力，而海关编码（HS Code）等复杂规则直接影响全球供应链效率

Method: 基于真实电商平台数据构建HSCodeComp基准，包含632个专家标注的跨品类商品条目，要求通过分层规则推理预测10位HS编码

Result: 最佳代理仅达46.8%准确率，测试时扩展技术无法提升性能，证明分层规则应用存在显著技术瓶颈

Conclusion: HSCodeComp填补了深度搜索代理评估空白，揭示了现有模型在复杂规则推理方面的根本性缺陷，为后续研究提供方向

Abstract: Effective deep search agents must not only access open-domain and
domain-specific knowledge but also apply complex rules-such as legal clauses,
medical manuals and tariff rules. These rules often feature vague boundaries
and implicit logic relationships, making precise application challenging for
agents. However, this critical capability is largely overlooked by current
agent benchmarks.
  To fill this gap, we introduce HSCodeComp, the first realistic, expert-level
e-commerce benchmark designed to evaluate deep search agents in hierarchical
rule application. In this task, the deep reasoning process of agents is guided
by these rules to predict 10-digit Harmonized System Code (HSCode) of products
with noisy but realistic descriptions. These codes, established by the World
Customs Organization, are vital for global supply chain efficiency. Built from
real-world data collected from large-scale e-commerce platforms, our proposed
HSCodeComp comprises 632 product entries spanning diverse product categories,
with these HSCodes annotated by several human experts.
  Extensive experimental results on several state-of-the-art LLMs, open-source,
and closed-source agents reveal a huge performance gap: best agent achieves
only 46.8% 10-digit accuracy, far below human experts at 95.0%. Besides,
detailed analysis demonstrates the challenges of hierarchical rule application,
and test-time scaling fails to improve performance further.

Conclusion: 该系统有效整合前沿检测技术与工程化部署，为LLM应用提供了开源、可扩展的全方位安全防护解决方案。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into
real-world applications, safeguarding them against unsafe, malicious, or
privacy-violating content is critically important. We present OpenGuardrails,
the first open-source project to provide both a context-aware safety and
manipulation detection model and a deployable platform for comprehensive AI
guardrails. OpenGuardrails protects against content-safety risks,
model-manipulation attacks (e.g., prompt injection, jailbreaking,
code-interpreter abuse, and the generation/execution of malicious code), and
data leakage. Content-safety and model-manipulation detection are implemented
by a unified large model, while data-leakage identification and redaction are
performed by a separate lightweight NER pipeline (e.g., Presidio-style models
or regex-based detectors). The system can be deployed as a security gateway or
an API-based service, with enterprise-grade, fully private deployment options.
OpenGuardrails achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on safety
benchmarks, excelling in both prompt and response classification across
English, Chinese, and multilingual tasks. All models are released under the
Apache 2.0 license for public use.

Motivation: 传统对抗样本通过微小扰动使模型误判，本文研究与之相反的对抗样本形式——与原始样本显著不同但导致相同模型输出的样本，以揭示对抗样本分布的广泛性及其对模型安全的影响。

Method: 提出NI-FGSM、NI-FGM及其动量变体NMI-FGSM、NMI-FGM算法，通过负向迭代梯度优化生成对抗样本。

Result: 成功生成可用于攻击的对抗样本，证明对抗样本不仅存在于原始样本邻域，而是广泛分布于整个样本空间。

Conclusion: 对抗样本具有空间广泛性，新算法有效生成此类样本，为模型安全防御提供新的研究方向。

Abstract: Most machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which
poses security concerns on these models. Adversarial examples are crafted by
applying subtle but intentionally worst-case modifications to examples from the
dataset, leading the model to output a different answer from the original
example. In this paper, adversarial examples are formed in an exactly opposite
manner, which are significantly different from the original examples but result
in the same answer. We propose a novel set of algorithms to produce such
adversarial examples, including the negative iterative fast gradient sign
method (NI-FGSM) and the negative iterative fast gradient method (NI-FGM),
along with their momentum variants: the negative momentum iterative fast
gradient sign method (NMI-FGSM) and the negative momentum iterative fast
gradient method (NMI-FGM). Adversarial examples constructed by these methods
could be used to perform an attack on machine learning systems in certain
occasions. Moreover, our results show that the adversarial examples are not
merely distributed in the neighbourhood of the examples from the dataset;
instead, they are distributed extensively in the sample space.

Motivation: 应对大型语言模型在移动设备部署的需求，探索MLX框架对苹果芯片的优化能力，促进设备端机器学习应用发展。

Method: 创建MLX-transformers框架转换PyTorch模型检查点，在MacBook和NVIDIA GPU上对比BERT/RoBERTa/XLM-RoBERTa模型的推理延迟。

Result: MLX在苹果设备展现与CUDA GPU相当的推理性能，验证其有效利用Apple Silicon架构优势的能力。

Conclusion: MLX框架为苹果生态系统提供了高效的设备端ML解决方案，支持直接运行Hugging Face模型而不需繁琐的框架转换。

Abstract: The recent widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) and machine
learning in general has sparked research interest in exploring the
possibilities of deploying these models on smaller devices such as laptops and
mobile phones. This creates a need for frameworks and approaches that are
capable of taking advantage of on-device hardware. The MLX framework was
created to address this need. It is a framework optimized for machine learning
(ML) computations on Apple silicon devices, facilitating easier research,
experimentation, and prototyping.
  This paper presents a performance evaluation of MLX, focusing on inference
latency of transformer models. We compare the performance of different
transformer architecture implementations in MLX with their Pytorch
counterparts. For this research we create a framework called MLX-transformers
which includes different transformer implementations in MLX and downloads the
model checkpoints in pytorch and converts it to the MLX format. By leveraging
the advanced architecture and capabilities of Apple Silicon, MLX-Transformers
enables seamless execution of transformer models directly sourced from Hugging
Face, eliminating the need for checkpoint conversion often required when
porting models between frameworks.
  Our study benchmarks different transformer models on two Apple Silicon
macbook devices against an NVIDIA CUDA GPU. Specifically, we compare the
inference latency performance of models with the same parameter sizes and
checkpoints. We evaluate the performance of BERT, RoBERTa, and XLM-RoBERTa
models, with the intention of extending future work to include models of
different modalities, thus providing a more comprehensive assessment of MLX's
capabilities. The results highlight MLX's potential in enabling efficient and
more accessible on-device ML applications within Apple's ecosystem.

Method: BAPO方法动态调整PPO类目标的裁剪边界，自适应平衡正负梯度贡献，保持策略熵稳定

Result: 在AIME 2024/2025基准测试中，7B模型超越SkyWork等开源模型，32B模型超越o3-mini等商业系统

Conclusion: 通过理论推导的Entropy-Clip Rule揭示固定裁剪机制缺陷，BAPO为大规模语言模型对齐提供高效稳定的强化学习框架

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become the core paradigm for
aligning and strengthening large language models (LLMs). Yet, applying RL in
off-policy settings--where stale data from past policies are used for
training--improves sample efficiency, but remains challenging: policy entropy
declines sharply, optimization often becomes unstable and may even collapse.
Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we identify two key insights: (i)
an imbalance in optimization, where negative-advantage samples dominate the
policy gradient, suppressing useful behaviors and risking gradient explosions;
and (ii) the derived Entropy-Clip Rule, which reveals that the fixed clipping
mechanism in PPO-like objectives systematically blocks entropy-increasing
updates, thereby driving the policy toward over-exploitation at the expense of
exploration. Building on these insights, we propose BAlanced Policy
Optimization with Adaptive Clipping (BAPO), a simple yet effective method that
dynamically adjusts clipping bounds to adaptively re-balance positive and
negative contributions, preserve entropy, and stabilize RL optimization. Across
diverse off-policy scenarios--including sample replay and partial rollout--BAPO
achieves fast, stable, and data-efficient training. On AIME 2024 and AIME 2025
benchmarks, our 7B BAPO model surpasses open-source counterparts such as
SkyWork-OR1-7B, while our 32B BAPO model not only achieves state-of-the-art
results among models of the same scale but also outperforms leading proprietary
systems like o3-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking.

TL;DR: NeuroAda提出了一种结合添加模块与选择性参数更新的高效微调方法，在保持高内存效率的同时实现细粒度模型适配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数高效微调方法存在内存效率与细粒度适配能力的矛盾：LoRA等添加式方法表征能力有限，而选择性微调方法内存消耗大。

Method: 1. 识别网络重要连接；2. 为选定参数创建旁路连接；3. 仅更新旁路参数，冻结原模型参数。

Result: 在23+个NLP任务中达到SOTA，仅需≤0.02%可训练参数，CUDA内存使用降低60%。

Conclusion: NeuroAda在细粒度适配与内存效率间取得最佳平衡，为轻量级模型适配提供新方向。

Abstract: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods primarily fall into
two categories: addition-based and selective in-situ adaptation. The former,
such as LoRA, introduce additional modules to adapt the model to downstream
tasks, offering strong memory efficiency. However, their representational
capacity is often limited, making them less suitable for fine-grained
adaptation. In contrast, the latter directly fine-tunes a carefully chosen
subset of the original model parameters, allowing for more precise and
effective adaptation, but at the cost of significantly increased memory
consumption. To reconcile this trade-off, we propose NeuroAda, a novel PEFT
method that enables fine-grained model finetuning while maintaining high memory
efficiency. Our approach first identifies important parameters (i.e.,
connections within the network) as in selective adaptation, and then introduces
bypass connections for these selected parameters. During finetuning, only the
bypass connections are updated, leaving the original model parameters frozen.
Empirical results on 23+ tasks spanning both natural language generation and
understanding demonstrate that NeuroAda achieves state-of-the-art performance
with as little as $\leq \textbf{0.02}\%$ trainable parameters, while reducing
CUDA memory usage by up to 60%. We release our code here:

Abstract: In this technical report, we present the Ring-linear model series,
specifically including Ring-mini-linear-2.0 and Ring-flash-linear-2.0.
Ring-mini-linear-2.0 comprises 16B parameters and 957M activations, while
Ring-flash-linear-2.0 contains 104B parameters and 6.1B activations. Both
models adopt a hybrid architecture that effectively integrates linear attention
and softmax attention, significantly reducing I/O and computational overhead in
long-context inference scenarios. Compared to a 32 billion parameter dense
model, this series reduces inference cost to 1/10, and compared to the original
Ring series, the cost is also reduced by over 50%. Furthermore, through
systematic exploration of the ratio between different attention mechanisms in
the hybrid architecture, we have identified the currently optimal model
structure. Additionally, by leveraging our self-developed high-performance FP8
operator library-linghe, overall training efficiency has been improved by 50%.
Benefiting from the high alignment between the training and inference engine
operators, the models can undergo long-term, stable, and highly efficient
optimization during the reinforcement learning phase, consistently maintaining
SOTA performance across multiple challenging complex reasoning benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有反学习方法通过梯度上升降低目标响应概率时，会导致概率质量向语义相关的高可能性区域转移（挤压效应），造成虚假遗忘效果。

Method: BS-T通过抑制高概率token，BS-S通过移除整个高置信序列，联合抑制目标响应与模型自身的高置信生成（模型信念）。

Result: 在多种模型架构和测试基准上的实验证明，该方法能有效消除挤压效应，实现更彻底的内容遗忘且保持模型实用性。

Conclusion: 将模型信念融入反学习目标直接对抗挤压效应，BS框架为语言模型安全部署提供了更可靠的内容遗忘方案。

Abstract: Large language models trained on vast corpora inherently risk memorizing
sensitive or harmful content, which may later resurface in their outputs.
Prevailing unlearning methods generally rely on gradient ascent and its
variants to lower the probability of specific target responses. However, we
find that this strategy induces a critical side effect: probability mass is
redistributed into high-likelihood regions, often corresponding to semantically
related rephrasings of the targets. We refer to this as the squeezing effect,
which explains why many methods yield merely spurious unlearning, a problem
further obscured by automated metrics (e.g., ROUGE, truth ratio) that misreport
actual success. To address this, we propose a bootstrapping (BS) framework that
explicitly links the squeezing effect with the model's own high-confidence
generations, namely its model beliefs. Since model beliefs inherently capture
the very high-likelihood regions where probability mass is squeezed,
incorporating them into the unlearning objective directly counters the
squeezing effect. By jointly suppressing both target responses and model
beliefs, BS-T (token) attenuates high-probability tokens, whereas BS-S
(sequence) removes entire high-confidence generations, together achieving more
thorough forgetting while preserving utility. Extensive experiments across
diverse benchmarks with various model families confirm the effectiveness of our
approach.

Conclusion: GaLLoP通过智能参数选择机制，实现了性能与模型鲁棒性的双重突破，为安全高效的大模型适配提供了新思路

Abstract: Sparse fine-tuning techniques adapt LLMs to downstream tasks by only tuning a
sparse subset of model parameters. However, the effectiveness of sparse
adaptation depends on optimally selecting the model parameters to be
fine-tuned. In this work, we introduce a novel sparse fine-tuning technique
named GaLLoP: Gradient-based Sparse Learning on Low-Magnitude Parameters, which
fine-tunes only those model parameters which have the largest gradient
magnitudes on downstream tasks and the smallest pre-trained magnitudes,
intuitively prioritizing parameters that are highly task-relevant, but
minimally disruptive to pre-trained knowledge. Our experimentation with LLaMA3
8B and Gemma 2B as base models shows that GaLLoP consistently improves or
matches the in-distribution as well as out-of-distribution performance obtained
via the usage of other leading parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques,
including LoRA, DoRA, and SAFT. Our analysis demonstrates that GaLLoP mitigates
catastrophic forgetting and memorization of task data, as important pre-trained
parameters remain unchanged, and stabilizes performance relative to other
fine-tuning techniques, robustly generalizing across most random seeds.

Abstract: Suppose Alice trains an open-weight language model and Bob uses a blackbox
derivative of Alice's model to produce text. Can Alice prove that Bob is using
her model, either by querying Bob's derivative model (query setting) or from
the text alone (observational setting)? We formulate this question as an
independence testing problem--in which the null hypothesis is that Bob's model
or text is independent of Alice's randomized training run--and investigate it
through the lens of palimpsestic memorization in language models: models are
more likely to memorize data seen later in training, so we can test whether Bob
is using Alice's model using test statistics that capture correlation between
Bob's model or text and the ordering of training examples in Alice's training
run. If Alice has randomly shuffled her training data, then any significant
correlation amounts to exactly quantifiable statistical evidence against the
null hypothesis, regardless of the composition of Alice's training data. In the
query setting, we directly estimate (via prompting) the likelihood Bob's model
gives to Alice's training examples and order; we correlate the likelihoods of
over 40 fine-tunes of various Pythia and OLMo base models ranging from 1B to
12B parameters with the base model's training data order, achieving a p-value
on the order of at most 1e-8 in all but six cases. In the observational
setting, we try two approaches based on estimating 1) the likelihood of Bob's
text overlapping with spans of Alice's training examples and 2) the likelihood
of Bob's text with respect to different versions of Alice's model we obtain by
repeating the last phase (e.g., 1%) of her training run on reshuffled data. The
second approach can reliably distinguish Bob's text from as little as a few
hundred tokens; the first does not involve any retraining but requires many
more tokens (several hundred thousand) to achieve high power.
