In this work, we introduce Spatial ModernBERT-a transformer-based\nmodel augmented with spatial embeddings-to accurately detect and extract\ntabular data and key-value fields from complex financial documents. We cast the\nextraction task as token classification across three heads: (1) Label Head,\nclassifying each token as a label (e.g., PO Number, PO Date, Item Description,\nQuantity, Base Cost, MRP, etc.); (2) Column Head, predicting column indices;\n(3) Row Head, distinguishing the start of item rows and header rows. The model\nis pretrained on the PubTables-1M dataset, then fine-tuned on a financial\ndocument dataset, achieving robust performance through cross-entropy loss on\neach classification head. We propose a post-processing method to merge tokens\nusing B-I-IB tagging, reconstruct the tabular layout, and extract key-value\npairs.

We evaluate OPENXRD on a well-defined set of 217\nexpert-level XRD questions by comparing different vision-language models,\nincluding GPT-4 and LLaVA-based frameworks such as Mistral, LLaMA, and QWEN,\nunder both closed-book (without supporting material) and open-book (with\nsupporting material) conditions. Our experimental results show significant\naccuracy improvements in models that use the GPT-4.5-generated summaries,\nparticularly those with limited prior training in crystallography. OPENXRD uses\nknowledge from larger models to fill knowledge gaps in crystallography and\nshows that AI-generated texts can help smaller models reason more effectively\nin scientific tasks. While the current version of OPENXRD focuses on text-based\ninputs, we also explore future extensions such as adding real crystal diagrams\nor diffraction patterns to improve interpretation in specialized materials\nscience contexts.

However, the majority of state-of-the-art\napproaches are evaluated on tasks that require minimal prompt templates and on\nvery large and highly capable LLMs. In contrast, solving complex tasks that\nrequire detailed information to be included in the prompt increases the amount\nof text that needs to be optimised. Furthermore, smaller models have been shown\nto be more sensitive to prompt design. To address these challenges, we propose\nan evolutionary search approach to automated discrete prompt optimisation\nconsisting of two phases. In the first phase, grammar-guided genetic\nprogramming is invoked to synthesise prompt-creating programmes by searching\nthe space of programmes populated by function compositions of syntactic,\ndictionary-based and LLM-based prompt-editing functions. In the second phase,\nlocal search is applied to explore the neighbourhoods of best-performing\nprogrammes in an attempt to further fine-tune their performance. Our approach\noutperforms three state-of-the-art prompt optimisation approaches,\nPromptWizard, OPRO, and RL-Prompt, on three relatively small general-purpose\nLLMs in four domain-specific challenging tasks.

In this work, we explore the use of such descriptors with an\nopen-source LLM, Qwen 2.5 72B, to assess responses from the publicly available\nS&I Corpus in a zero-shot setting. Our results show that this approach -\nrelying solely on textual information - achieves competitive performance: while\nit does not outperform state-of-the-art speech LLMs fine-tuned for the task, it\nsurpasses a BERT-based model trained specifically for this purpose. NLA proves\nparticularly effective in mismatched task settings, is generalisable to other\ndata types and languages, and offers greater interpretability, as it is\ngrounded in clearly explainable, widely applicable language descriptors."}

However, existing MLLMs are primarily trained on generic\ndatasets, limiting their ability to reason on domain-specific visual cues such\nas those in facial images. In particular, tasks that require detailed\nunderstanding of facial structure, expression, emotion, and demographic\nfeatures remain underexplored by MLLMs due to the lack of large-scale annotated\nface image-text datasets. In this work, we introduce FaceLLM, a multimodal\nlarge language model trained specifically for facial image understanding. To\nconstruct the training data, we propose a novel weakly supervised pipeline that\nuses ChatGPT with attribute-aware prompts to generate high-quality\nquestion-answer pairs based on images from the FairFace dataset. The resulting\ncorpus, called FairFaceGPT, covers a diverse set of attributes including\nexpression, pose, skin texture, and forensic information. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that FaceLLM improves the performance of MLLMs on various\nface-centric tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance. This work\nhighlights the potential of synthetic supervision via language models for\nbuilding domain-specialized MLLMs, and sets a precedent for trustworthy,\nhuman-centric multimodal AI systems.

However,\nmost text-to-image retrieval systems are limited to RGB data, failing to\nexploit the unique physical information captured by other sensors, such as the\nall-weather structural sensitivity of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) or the\nspectral signatures in optical multispectral data. To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce CrisisLandMark, a new large-scale corpus of over 647,000 Sentinel-1\nSAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral images paired with structured textual\nannotations for land cover, land use, and crisis events harmonized from\nauthoritative land cover systems (CORINE and Dynamic World) and crisis-specific\nsources. We then present CLOSP (Contrastive Language Optical SAR Pretraining),\na novel framework that uses text as a bridge to align unpaired optical and SAR\nimages into a unified embedding space. Our experiments show that CLOSP achieves\na new state-of-the-art, improving retrieval nDGC by 54% over existing models.\nAdditionally, we find that the unified training strategy overcomes the inherent\ndifficulty of interpreting SAR imagery by transferring rich semantic knowledge\nfrom the optical domain with indirect interaction. Furthermore, GeoCLOSP, which\nintegrates geographic coordinates into our framework, creates a powerful\ntrade-off between generality and specificity: while the CLOSP excels at general\nsemantic tasks, the GeoCLOSP becomes a specialized expert for retrieving\nlocation-dependent crisis events and rare geographic features. This work\nhighlights that the integration of diverse sensor data and geographic context\nis essential for unlocking the full potential of remote sensing archives."}

Unreliable Results of Reinforcement Learning Due to Data Contamination", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "comment": "26 pages", "summary": "The reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have been a\nlongstanding focus of research. Recent works have further enhanced these\ncapabilities using reinforcement learning (RL), with many new methods claiming\nsignificant improvements with minimal or no external supervision. Surprisingly,\nsome studies even suggest that random or incorrect reward signals can enhance\nreasoning performance. However, these breakthroughs are mostly reported on the\nQwen2.5 model family and evaluated on well-known benchmarks such as MATH-500,\nAMC, and AIME, while failing to achieve similar gains on other models like\nLlama, which warrants further investigation. Our analysis shows that although\nQwen2.5 achieves strong mathematical reasoning performance, its pretraining on\nlarge-scale web corpora makes it vulnerable to data contamination in popular\nbenchmarks. As a result, results derived from these benchmarks may be\nunreliable. To address this, we introduce a generator that produces fully\nsynthetic arithmetic problems of arbitrary length and difficulty, yielding a\nclean dataset we call RandomCalculation. Using these leakage-free datasets, we\nshow that only accurate reward signals consistently improve performance, while\nnoisy or incorrect signals do not. We advocate for evaluating RL methods on\nuncontaminated benchmarks and across diverse model families to ensure\ntrustworthy conclusions."}
