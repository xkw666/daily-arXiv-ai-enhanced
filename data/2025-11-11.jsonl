Accepted by IROS 2025", "summary": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a key rendering pipeline for digital asset creation due to its balance between efficiency and visual quality. To address the issues of unstable pose estimation and scene representation distortion caused by geometric texture inconsistency in large outdoor scenes with weak or repetitive textures, we approach the problem from two aspects: pose estimation and scene representation. For pose estimation, we leverage LiDAR-IMU Odometry to provide prior poses for cameras in large-scale environments. These prior pose constraints are incorporated into COLMAP's triangulation process, with pose optimization performed via bundle adjustment. Ensuring consistency between pixel data association and prior poses helps maintain both robustness and accuracy. For scene representation, we introduce normal vector constraints and effective rank regularization to enforce consistency in the direction and shape of Gaussian primitives. These constraints are jointly optimized with the existing photometric loss to enhance the map quality. We evaluate our approach using both public and self-collected datasets. In terms of pose optimization, our method requires only one-third of the time while maintaining accuracy and robustness across both datasets. In terms of scene representation, the results show that our method significantly outperforms conventional 3DGS pipelines. Notably, on self-collected datasets characterized by weak or repetitive textures, our approach demonstrates enhanced visualization capabilities and achieves superior overall performance.

This discrepancy in representation prevents speech language models from performing instruction-based free-form editing. To solve this challenge, we introduce a novel framework that unifies speech understanding, generation, and editing. The core of our unified model is a unified continuous speech tokenizer MingTok-Audio, the first continuous tokenizer to effectively integrate semantic and acoustic features, which makes it suitable for both understanding and generation tasks. Based on this unified continuous audio tokenizer, we developed the speech language model Ming-UniAudio, which achieved a balance between generation and understanding capabilities. Ming-UniAudio sets new state-of-the-art (SOTA) records on 8 out of 12 metrics on the ContextASR benchmark. Notably, for Chinese voice cloning, it achieves a highly competitive Seed-TTS-WER of 0.95. Leveraging this foundational model, we further trained a dedicated speech editing model Ming-UniAudio-Edit, the first speech language model that enables universal, free-form speech editing guided solely by natural language instructions, handling both semantic and acoustic modifications without timestamp condition. To rigorously assess the editing capability and establish a foundation for future research, we introduce Ming-Freeform-Audio-Edit, the first comprehensive benchmark tailored for instruction-based free-form speech editing, featuring diverse scenarios and evaluation dimensions spanning semantic correctness, acoustic quality, and instruction alignment. We open-sourced the continuous audio tokenizer, the unified foundational model, and the free-form instruction-based editing model to facilitate the development of unified audio understanding, generation, and manipulation."}

Existing data extraction methods, particularly heuristic-based divergence attacks, often exhibit limited success and offer limited insight into the fundamental drivers of memorization leakage. This paper introduces Confusion-Inducing Attacks (CIA), a principled framework for extracting memorized data by systematically maximizing model uncertainty. We empirically demonstrate that the emission of memorized text during divergence is preceded by a sustained spike in token-level prediction entropy. CIA leverages this insight by optimizing input snippets to deliberately induce this consecutive high-entropy state. For aligned LLMs, we further propose Mismatched Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) to simultaneously weaken their alignment and induce targeted confusion, thereby increasing susceptibility to our attacks. Experiments on various unaligned and aligned LLMs demonstrate that our proposed attacks outperform existing baselines in extracting verbatim and near-verbatim training data without requiring prior knowledge of the training data. Our findings highlight persistent memorization risks across various LLMs and offer a more systematic method for assessing these vulnerabilities."}

However, prevailing moderation systems are centralized and task-specific, offering limited transparency and neglecting diverse user preferences--an approach ill-suited for privacy-sensitive or decentralized environments. We propose a novel framework that leverages in-context learning (ICL) with foundation models to unify the detection of toxicity, spam, and negative sentiment across binary, multi-class, and multi-label settings. Crucially, our approach enables lightweight personalization, allowing users to easily block new categories, unblock existing ones, or extend detection to semantic variations through simple prompt-based interventions--all without model retraining. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks (TextDetox, UCI SMS, SST2) and a new, annotated Mastodon dataset reveal that: (i) foundation models achieve strong cross-task generalization, often matching or surpassing task-specific fine-tuned models; (ii) effective personalization is achievable with as few as one user-provided example or definition; and (iii) augmenting prompts with label definitions or rationales significantly enhances robustness to noisy, real-world data. Our work demonstrates a definitive shift beyond one-size-fits-all moderation, establishing ICL as a practical, privacy-preserving, and highly adaptable pathway for the next generation of user-centric content safety systems. To foster reproducibility and facilitate future research, we publicly release our code on GitHub and the annotated Mastodon dataset on Hugging Face."}

This work introduces FlowMM, an adaptive framework for cross-modal information flow-guided multimodal KV cache merging. FlowMM leverages cross-modal information flow to dynamically apply layer-specific merging strategies, capturing modality-specific patterns while preserving contextual integrity. Furthermore, we introduce a sensitivity-adaptive token matching mechanism that jointly evaluates token similarity and task-critical sensitivity, merging low-risk tokens while safeguarding high-sensitivity ones. Extensive experiments across diverse leading MLLMs show that FlowMM reduces KV cache memory by 80% to 95% and decoding latency by 1.3-1.8x, while maintaining competitive task performance."}

Diffusion models like Stable Diffusion generate high-quality images and videos from text. Evidence shows rapid expansion: 74.2% of newly published webpages now contain AI-generated material (Ryan Law 2025), 30-40% of the active web corpus is synthetic (Spennemann 2025; arXiv:2504.08755), 52% of U.S. adults use LLMs for writing, coding, or research (Staff 2025), and audits find AI involvement in 18% of financial complaints and 24% of press releases (Liang et al. 2025). The underlying neural architectures, including Transformers (Vaswani et al. 2023; arXiv:1706.03762), RNNs, LSTMs, GANs, and diffusion networks, depend on large, diverse, human-authored datasets (Shi & Iyengar 2019). As synthetic content dominates, recursive training risks eroding linguistic and semantic diversity, producing Model Collapse (Shumailov et al. 2024; arXiv:2307.15043; Dohmatob et al. 2024; arXiv:2402.07712). This study quantifies and forecasts collapse onset by examining year-wise semantic similarity in English-language Wikipedia (filtered Common Crawl) from 2013 to 2025 using Transformer embeddings and cosine similarity metrics. Results reveal a steady rise in similarity before public LLM adoption, likely driven by early RNN/LSTM translation and text-normalization pipelines, though modest due to a smaller scale. Observed fluctuations reflect irreducible linguistic diversity, variable corpus size across years, finite sampling error, and an exponential rise in similarity after the public adoption of LLM models. These findings provide a data-driven estimate of when recursive AI contamination may significantly threaten data richness and model generalization."}

While recent dictionary learning methods such as Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) provide a promising route to discover human-interpretable features, they suffer from a variety of problems, including a systematic failure to capture the rich conceptual information that drives linguistic understanding. Instead, they exhibit a bias towards shallow, token-specific, or noisy features, such as \"the phrase 'The' at the start of sentences\". In this work, we propose that this is due to a fundamental issue with how dictionary learning methods for LLMs are trained. Language itself has a rich, well-studied structure spanning syntax, semantics, and pragmatics; however, current unsupervised methods largely ignore this linguistic knowledge, leading to poor feature discovery that favors superficial patterns over meaningful concepts. We focus on a simple but important aspect of language: semantic content has long-range dependencies and tends to be smooth over a sequence, whereas syntactic information is much more local. Building on this insight, we introduce Temporal Sparse Autoencoders (T-SAEs), which incorporate a novel contrastive loss encouraging consistent activations of high-level features over adjacent tokens. This simple yet powerful modification enables SAEs to disentangle semantic from syntactic features in a self-supervised manner. Across multiple datasets and models, T-SAEs recover smoother, more coherent semantic concepts without sacrificing reconstruction quality. Strikingly, they exhibit clear semantic structure despite being trained without explicit semantic signal, offering a new pathway for unsupervised interpretability in language models."}

The members of the vocabulary can be built of code points or bytes. Using code points means that all members of the vocabulary are valid UTF-8 characters. However, it also requires thousands of initial members to achieve acceptable coverage of inputs. Beginning with bytes, on the contrary, avoids out-of-vocabulary errors with only 256 initial members of the vocabulary, but the members of the vocabulary and sequences of them are not guaranteed to be valid UTF-8. Sequences that are not valid UTF-8 break code that assumes its input to be valid UTF-8. Applications of language models must account for the breakage thereby introduced. In this paper, we formalize tokenization using monoid theory and prove that tokenizers whose vocabularies contain tokens that are ill-formed UTF-8 can always produce sequences that are ill-formed UTF-8. We demonstrate formally that attempting to incrementally convert tokens back to a string and interpret the results as UTF-8 gives different results than converting the whole sequence of tokens at once. This formal result predicts real-world bugs: we evaluate mitigations for the problem identified and provide case studies of major foundation models, serving engines, and constrained generation systems."}

We propose Base-Aligned Model Collaboration (BACo), an inference-time token-level model collaboration framework that dynamically combines a base LLM with its aligned counterpart to optimize diversity and quality. Inspired by prior work (Fei et al., 2025), BACo employs routing strategies that determine, at each token, from which model to decode based on next-token prediction uncertainty and predicted contents' semantic role. Prior diversity-promoting methods, such as retraining, prompt engineering, and multi-sampling methods, improve diversity but often degrade quality or require costly decoding or post-training. In contrast, BACo achieves both high diversity and quality post hoc within a single pass, while offering strong controllability. We explore a family of routing strategies, across three open-ended generation tasks and 13 metrics covering diversity and quality, BACo consistently surpasses state-of-the-art inference-time baselines. With our best router, BACo achieves a 21.3% joint improvement in diversity and quality. Human evaluations also mirror these improvements. The results suggest that collaboration between base and aligned models can optimize and control diversity and quality."}

In this work, we introduce OckBench, a model-agnostic and hardware-agnostic benchmark that evaluates both accuracy and token count for reasoning and coding tasks. Through experiments comparing multiple open- and closed-source models, we uncover that many models with comparable accuracy differ wildly in token consumption, revealing that efficiency variance is a neglected but significant axis of differentiation. We further demonstrate Pareto frontiers over the accuracy-efficiency plane and argue for an evaluation paradigm shift: we should no longer treat tokens as \"free\" to multiply. OckBench provides a unified platform for measuring, comparing, and guiding research in token-efficient reasoning. Our benchmarks are available at https://ockbench.github.io/ ."}

As models develop induction heads, they often experience a sharp drop in training loss, a phenomenon cited as evidence that induction heads may serve as a prerequisite for more complex in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. In this work, we ask whether transformers can still acquire ICL capabilities when inductive copying is suppressed. We propose Hapax, a setting where we omit the loss contribution of any token that can be correctly predicted by induction heads. Despite a significant reduction in inductive copying, performance on abstractive ICL tasks (i.e., tasks where the answer is not contained in the input context) remains comparable and surpasses the vanilla model on 13 of 21 tasks, even though 31.7\\% of tokens are omitted from the loss. Furthermore, our model achieves lower loss values on token positions that cannot be predicted correctly by induction heads. Mechanistic analysis further shows that models trained with Hapax develop fewer and weaker induction heads but still preserve ICL capabilities. Taken together, our findings indicate that inductive copying is not essential for learning abstractive ICL mechanisms."}

First, the large language model captures contextual dependencies and deep semantic representations of the input text, providing a rich feature foundation for subsequent modeling. Then, based on multi-level feature representations, the feature pyramid mechanism effectively integrates semantic features of different scales, balancing global information and local details to construct hierarchical semantic expressions. Furthermore, the fused features are transformed into graph representations, and graph neural networks are employed to capture latent semantic relations and logical dependencies in the text, enabling comprehensive modeling of complex interactions among semantic units. On this basis, the readout and classification modules generate the final category predictions. The proposed method demonstrates significant advantages in robustness alignment experiments, outperforming existing models on ACC, F1-Score, AUC, and Precision, which verifies the effectiveness and stability of the framework.

Most existing approaches rely on fine-tuning to balance unlearning efficiency with general language capabilities. However, these methods typically require training or access to retain data, which is often unavailable in real world scenarios. Although these methods can perform well when both forget and retain data are available, few works have demonstrated equivalent capability in more practical, data-limited scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose Detect-Reasoning Augmented GeneratiON (DRAGON), a systematic, reasoning-based framework that utilizes in-context chain-of-thought (CoT) instructions to guard deployed LLMs before inference. Instead of modifying the base model, DRAGON leverages the inherent instruction-following ability of LLMs and introduces a lightweight detection module to identify forget-worthy prompts without any retain data. These are then routed through a dedicated CoT guard model to enforce safe and accurate in-context intervention. To robustly evaluate unlearning performance, we introduce novel metrics for unlearning performance and the continual unlearning setting. Extensive experiments across three representative unlearning tasks validate the effectiveness of DRAGON, demonstrating its strong unlearning capability, scalability, and applicability in practical scenarios."}

Meanwhile, fine-tuning remains the default operation for adapting LLMs to new domains and tasks. Despite their widespread adoption, these two post-training interventions have been studied in isolation, leaving open a crucial question: if we fine-tune an edited model, do the edits survive? This question is motivated by two practical scenarios: removing covert or malicious edits, and preserving beneficial edits. If fine-tuning impairs edits as shown in Figure 1, current KE methods become less useful, as every fine-tuned model would require re-editing, which significantly increases the cost; if edits persist, fine-tuned models risk propagating hidden malicious edits, raising serious safety concerns. To this end, we systematically quantify edits decay after fine-tuning, investigating how fine-tuning affects knowledge editing. We evaluate two state-of-the-art editing methods (MEMIT, AlphaEdit) and three fine-tuning approaches (full-parameter, LoRA, DoRA) across five LLMs and three datasets, yielding 232 experimental configurations. Our results show that edits decay after fine-tuning, with survival varying across configurations, e.g., AlphaEdit edits decay more than MEMIT edits. Further, we propose selective-layer fine-tuning and find that fine-tuning edited layers only can effectively remove edits, though at a slight cost to downstream performance. Surprisingly, fine-tuning non-edited layers impairs more edits than full fine-tuning. Overall, our study establishes empirical baselines and actionable strategies for integrating knowledge editing with fine-tuning, and underscores that evaluating model editing requires considering the full LLM application pipeline."}

For retrieval, approaches commonly relied on English-centric embedding models, while LLMs were mostly generic, with limited use of medical-specific LLMs. For evaluation, automated metrics evaluated generation quality and task performance, whereas human evaluation focused on accuracy, completeness, relevance, and fluency, with insufficient attention to bias and safety. RAG applications were concentrated on question answering, report generation, text summarization, and information extraction. Overall, medical RAG remains at an early stage, requiring advances in clinical validation, cross-linguistic adaptation, and support for low-resource settings to enable trustworthy and responsible global use."}

Existing works towards NID mainly adopt a cascaded architecture, wherein the first stage focuses on encoding the utterances into informative text embeddings beforehand, while the latter is to group similar embeddings into clusters (i.e., intents), typically by K-Means. However, such a cascaded pipeline fails to leverage the feedback from both steps for mutual refinement, and, meanwhile, the embedding-only clustering overlooks nuanced textual semantics, leading to suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes NILC, a novel clustering framework specially catered for effective NID. Particularly, NILC follows an iterative workflow, in which clustering assignments are judiciously updated by carefully refining cluster centroids and text embeddings of uncertain utterances with the aid of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, NILC first taps into LLMs to create additional semantic centroids for clusters, thereby enriching the contextual semantics of the Euclidean centroids of embeddings. Moreover, LLMs are then harnessed to augment hard samples (ambiguous or terse utterances) identified from clusters via rewriting for subsequent cluster correction. Further, we inject supervision signals through non-trivial techniques seeding and soft must links for more accurate NID in the semi-supervised setting. Extensive experiments comparing NILC against multiple recent baselines under both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings showcase that NILC can achieve significant performance improvements over six benchmark datasets of diverse domains consistently."}

These agents possess a predefined set of skills or intents to fulfill specific user tasks. But every system has its own limitations. There are instances where, even for known intents, if any model exhibits low confidence, it results in rejection of utterances that necessitate manual annotation. Additionally, as time progresses, there may be a need to retrain these agents with new intents from the system-rejected queries to carry out additional tasks. Labeling all these emerging intents and rejected utterances over time is impractical, thus calling for an efficient mechanism to reduce annotation costs. In this paper, we introduce IDALC (Intent Detection and Active Learning based Correction), a semi-supervised framework designed to detect user intents and rectify system-rejected utterances while minimizing the need for human annotation. Empirical findings on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that our system surpasses baseline methods, achieving a 5-10% higher accuracy and a 4-8% improvement in macro-F1. Remarkably, we maintain the overall annotation cost at just 6-10% of the unlabelled data available to the system. The overall framework of IDALC is shown in Fig. 1"}

We challenge this narrative by observing that RL-enhanced models consistently outperform their base and supervised fine-tuned (SFT) counterparts on pure knowledge recall tasks, particularly those requiring traversal of hierarchical, structured knowledge (e.g., medical codes). We hypothesize these gains stem not from newly acquired data, but from improved procedural skills in navigating and searching existing knowledge hierarchies within the model parameters. To support this hypothesis, we show that structured prompting, which explicitly guides SFTed models through hierarchical traversal, recovers most of the performance gap (reducing 24pp to 7pp on MedConceptsQA for DeepSeek-V3/R1). We further find that while prompting improves final-answer accuracy, RL-enhanced models retain superior ability to recall correct procedural paths on deep-retrieval tasks. Finally our layer-wise internal activation analysis reveals that while factual representations (e.g., activations for the statement \"code 57.95 refers to urinary infection\") maintain high cosine similarity between SFT and RL models, query representations (e.g., \"what is code 57.95\") diverge noticeably, indicating that RL primarily transforms how models traverse knowledge rather than the knowledge representation itself."}

To address this gap, we conduct extensive experiments to investigate the entropy dynamics of LLMs trained with RLVR and analyze how model entropy correlates with response diversity, calibration, and performance across various benchmarks. Our findings reveal that the number of off-policy updates, the diversity of training data, and the clipping thresholds in the optimization objective are critical factors influencing the entropy of LLMs trained with RLVR. Moreover, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate that tokens with positive advantages are the primary contributors to entropy collapse, and that model entropy can be effectively regulated by adjusting the relative loss weights of tokens with positive and negative advantages during training."}

Our approach constructs a synthetic English-language dataset derived from Chinese-context discrimination categories, including regional, ethnic, and occupational biases.

Existing work simply fuses information from various modalities to learn stance representations, overlooking the varying contributions of stance expression from different modalities.

To address this, we get inspiration from the dual-process theory of human cognition and propose **ReMoD**, a framework that **Re**thinks **Mo**dality contribution of stance expression through a **D**ual-reasoning paradigm. ReMoD integrates *experience-driven intuitive reasoning* to capture initial stance cues with *deliberate reflective reasoning* to adjust for modality biases, refine stance judgments, and thereby dynamically weight modality contributions based on their actual expressive power for the target stance. Specifically, the intuitive stage queries the Modality Experience Pool (MEP) and Semantic Experience Pool (SEP) to form an initial stance hypothesis, prioritizing historically impactful modalities. This hypothesis is then refined in the reflective stage via two reasoning chains: Modality-CoT updates MEP with adaptive fusion strategies to amplify relevant modalities, while Semantic-CoT refines SEP with deeper contextual insights of stance semantics. These dual experience structures are continuously refined during training and recalled at inference to guide robust and context-aware stance decisions. Extensive experiments on the public MMSD benchmark demonstrate that our ReMoD significantly outperforms most baseline models and exhibits strong generalization capabilities."}

We evaluated the effectiveness of the Licensing Oracle through experiments comparing it with several state-of-the-art methods, including baseline language model generation, fine-tuning for factual recall, fine-tuning for abstention behavior, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

To lower inference costs, prior works train router models or deferral mechanisms that allocate easy queries to a small, efficient model, while forwarding harder queries to larger, more expensive models. However, these trained router models often lack robustness under domain shifts and require expensive data synthesis techniques such as Monte Carlo rollouts to obtain sufficient ground-truth routing labels for training. In this work, we propose Confidence-Guided Stepwise Model Routing for Cost-Efficient Reasoning (STEER), a domain-agnostic framework that performs fine-grained, step-level routing between smaller and larger LLMs without utilizing external models. STEER leverages confidence scores from the smaller model's logits prior to generating a reasoning step, so that the large model is invoked only when necessary. Extensive evaluations using different LLMs on a diverse set of challenging benchmarks across multiple domains such as Mathematical Reasoning, Multi-Hop QA, and Planning tasks indicate that STEER achieves competitive or enhanced accuracy while reducing inference costs (up to +20% accuracy with 48% less FLOPs compared to solely using the larger model on AIME), outperforming baselines that rely on trained external modules.

This enables a single model to flexibly perform tasks that previously required specialized models for each domain. However, these methods typically rely on text labels for supervision during training, biasing the model toward textual cues while potentially neglecting the full temporal features. Such a bias can lead to outputs that contradict the underlying time-series context. To address this issue, we construct the EvalTS benchmark, comprising 10 tasks across three difficulty levels, from fundamental temporal pattern recognition to complex real-world reasoning, to evaluate models under more challenging and realistic scenarios. We also propose TimeSense, a multimodal framework that makes LLMs proficient in time-series analysis by balancing textual reasoning with a preserved temporal sense. TimeSense incorporates a Temporal Sense module that reconstructs the input time-series within the model's context, ensuring that textual reasoning is grounded in the time-series dynamics. Moreover, to enhance spatial understanding of time-series data, we explicitly incorporate coordinate-based positional embeddings, which provide each time point with spatial context and enable the model to capture structural dependencies more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that TimeSense achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks, and it particularly outperforms existing methods on complex multi-dimensional time-series reasoning tasks."}

While explicit hate can often be captured through surface features, implicit hate requires deeper, full-model semantic processing. In this work, we question the need for repeated fine-tuning and analyze the role of HatePrototypes, class-level vector representations derived from language models optimized for hate speech detection and safety moderation. We find that these prototypes, built from as few as 50 examples per class, enable cross-task transfer between explicit and implicit hate, with interchangeable prototypes across benchmarks. Moreover, we show that parameter-free early exiting with prototypes is effective for both hate types. We release the code, prototype resources, and evaluation scripts to support future research on efficient and transferable hate speech detection."}

For both, LLMs have to demonstrate factual knowledge as well as a deep understanding of drug mechanisms, so they can recall and reason about relevant knowledge in novel situations. Drug mechanisms of action are described as a series of interactions between biomedical entities, which interlink into one or more chains directed from the drug to the targeted disease. Composing the effects of the interactions in a candidate chain leads to an inference about whether the drug might be useful or not for that disease. We introduce a dataset that evaluates LLMs on both factual knowledge of known mechanisms, and their ability to reason about them under novel situations, presented as counterfactuals that the models are unlikely to have seen during training. Using this dataset, we show that o4-mini outperforms the 4o, o3, and o3-mini models from OpenAI, and the recent small Qwen3-4B-thinking model closely matches o4-mini's performance, even outperforming it in some cases. We demonstrate that the open world setting for reasoning tasks, which requires the model to recall relevant knowledge, is more challenging than the closed world setting where the needed factual knowledge is provided. We also show that counterfactuals affecting internal links in the reasoning chain present a much harder task than those affecting a link from the drug mentioned in the prompt."}

SR-KI begins by encoding KBs into key-value pairs using a pretrained encoder, and injects them into LLMs' KV cache. Building on this representation, we employ a two-stage training paradigm: first locating a dedicated retrieval layer within the LLM, and then applying an attention-based loss at this layer to explicitly supervise attention toward relevant KB entries. Unlike traditional retrieval-augmented generation methods that rely heavily on the performance of external retrievers and multi-stage pipelines, SR-KI supports end-to-end inference by performing retrieval entirely within the models latent space. This design enables efficient compression of injected knowledge and facilitates dynamic knowledge updates. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SR-KI enables the integration of up to 40K KBs into a 7B LLM on a single A100 40GB GPU, and achieves strong retrieval performance, maintaining over 98% Recall@10 on the best-performing task and exceeding 88% on average across all tasks. Task performance on question answering and KB ID generation also demonstrates that SR-KI maintains strong performance while achieving up to 99.75% compression of the injected KBs."}

In this work, we conduct an extensive empirical study to investigate whether realignment truly benefits from using all available languages, or if strategically selected subsets can offer comparable or even improved cross-lingual transfer, and study the impact on LRLs. Our controlled experiments show that realignment can be particularly effective for LRLs and that using carefully selected, linguistically diverse subsets can match full multilingual alignment, and even outperform it for unseen LRLs. This indicates that effective realignment does not require exhaustive language coverage and can reduce data collection overhead, while remaining both efficient and robust when guided by informed language selection."}

Existing approaches often combine distillation and quantization, but most post-training quantization (PTQ) methods are task-agnostic, ignoring how task-specific signals are distributed across layers. In this work, we propose to use hidden representations that encode task-salient signals as a guideline for quantization. In order to fully utilize our innovative idea, this paper compares two new task-aware PTQ methods: Task-Aware Quantization (TAQ), which allocates bitwidths using task-conditioned statistics from hidden activations, and TAQO, which allocates precision based on direct layer sensitivity tests. From a small calibration set, these approaches identify task-relevant layers, preserving their precision while aggressively quantizing the rest. This yields stable task sensitivity profiles and efficient task-specialized models. Across models, TAQ and TAQO outperform the baselines; TAQ leads on Phi-4, while TAQO leads on Llama-3.1, Qwen3, and Qwen2.5. For instances, on Phi-4 it achieves 42.33 EM / 50.81 F1, far surpassing Activation-aware Weight Quantization (AWQ) (2.25 / 7.07), while remaining within < 1.0% of the original accuracy at lower average precision."}

The recent surge in generative model-powered datasets has compounded these quality challenges. In this work, we introduce RefineLab, the first LLM-driven framework that automatically refines raw QA textual data into high-quality datasets under a controllable token-budget constraint. RefineLab takes a set of target quality attributes (such as coverage and difficulty balance) as refinement objectives, and performs selective edits within a predefined token budget to ensure practicality and efficiency. In essence, RefineLab addresses a constrained optimization problem: improving the quality of QA samples as much as possible while respecting resource limitations. With a set of available refinement operations (e.g., rephrasing, distractor replacement), RefineLab takes as input the original dataset, a specified set of target quality dimensions, and a token budget, and determines which refinement operations should be applied to each QA sample. This process is guided by an assignment module that selects optimal refinement strategies to maximize overall dataset quality while adhering to the budget constraint. Experiments demonstrate that RefineLab consistently narrows divergence from expert datasets across coverage, difficulty alignment, factual fidelity, and distractor quality. RefineLab pioneers a scalable, customizable path to reproducible dataset design, with broad implications for LLM evaluation."}

This is in part due to the unavailability of textual data in these languages to train and apply NLP algorithms. In this work, we introduce ibom -- a dataset for machine translation and topic classification in four Coastal Nigerian languages from the Akwa Ibom State region: Anaang, Efik, Ibibio, and Oro. These languages are not represented in Google Translate or in major benchmarks such as Flores-200 or SIB-200.

Rep2Text employs a trainable adapter that projects a target model's internal representations into the embedding space of a decoding language model, which then autoregressively reconstructs the input text. Experiments on various model combinations (Llama-3.1-8B, Gemma-7B, Mistral-7B-v0.1, Llama-3.2-3B) demonstrate that, on average, over half of the information in 16-token sequences can be recovered from this compressed representation while maintaining strong semantic integrity and coherence. Furthermore, our analysis reveals an information bottleneck effect: longer sequences exhibit decreased token-level recovery while preserving strong semantic integrity.

Our findings reveal a severe modality bias: surgical recommendations for audio inputs varied by as much as 35% compared to identical text-based inputs, with one model providing 80% fewer recommendations. Further analysis uncovered age disparities of up to 12% between young and elderly voices, which persisted in most models despite chain-of-thought prompting. While explicit reasoning successfully eliminated gender bias, the impact of emotion was not detected due to poor recognition performance.

It further presents a pyramid multilayer mapping framework (e.g., three layers from the rhetorical model layer, to cognitive layer, and to epistemic layers) that reduces the resulting cognitive complexity. The degrees of expressive diversity and complexity reduction are quantified through binomial combinatorics and Shannon entropy analysis. A Marginal Rhetorical Bit (MRB) is identified, permitting the definition of a rhetorical-scalable parameter that measures expressive growth speed in bits per stage. A direct entropy measure shows that hierarchical selection over smaller subsets markedly reduces choice uncertainty compared with flat selection across all modes.

How can we be certain that an online post flagged as \"inappropriate\" was not simply the victim of a biased algorithm? This paper investigates this problem using a dual approach. First, I conduct a quantitative benchmark of a widely used toxicity model (unitary/toxic-bert) to measure performance disparity between text in African-American English (AAE) and Standard American English (SAE). The benchmark reveals a clear, systematic bias: on average, the model scores AAE text as 1.8 times more toxic and 8.8 times higher for \"identity hate\". Second, I introduce an interactive pedagogical tool that makes these abstract biases tangible. The tool's core mechanic, a user-controlled \"sensitivity threshold,\" demonstrates that the biased score itself is not the only harm; instead, the more-concerning harm is the human-set, seemingly neutral policy that ultimately operationalises discrimination.

To address the limitations of n-gram-based metrics, we introduce the dialect fidelity score (DFS) to quantify linguistic shift and the target dialect ratio (TDR) to measure the success of dialect translation. Experiments on Korean dialects across zero-shot and in-context learning baselines demonstrate that DIA-REFINE consistently enhances dialect fidelity. The proposed metrics distinguish between False Success cases, where high n-gram scores obscure failures in dialectal translation, and True Attempt cases, where genuine attempts at dialectal translation yield low n-gram scores. We also observed that models exhibit varying degrees of responsiveness to the framework, and that integrating in-context examples further improves the translation of dialectal expressions. Our work establishes a robust framework for goal-directed, inclusive dialect translation, providing both rigorous evaluation and critical insights into model performance."}

Recent test-time methods leverage textual feedback to overcome this, but they often critique and revise a single candidate response, lacking a principled mechanism to systematically analyze, weigh, and synthesize the strengths of multiple promising candidates. Such a mechanism is crucial because different responses may excel in distinct aspects (e.g., clarity, factual accuracy, or tone), and combining their best elements may produce a far superior outcome. This paper proposes the Textual Self-Attention Network (TSAN), a new paradigm for test-time preference optimization that requires no parameter updates. TSAN emulates self-attention entirely in natural language to overcome this gap: it analyzes multiple candidates by formatting them into textual keys and values, weighs their relevance using an LLM-based attention module, and synthesizes their strengths into a new, preference-aligned response under the guidance of the learned textual attention. This entire process operates in a textual gradient space, enabling iterative and interpretable optimization. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that with just three test-time iterations on a base SFT model, TSAN outperforms supervised models like Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct and surpasses the current state-of-the-art test-time alignment method by effectively leveraging multiple candidate solutions."}

Retrieval and evidence selection remain key failure points for the model, contributing to the overall performance drop. We further show that simple yet effective strategies, including evidence filtering and query reformulation, substantially mitigate these issues, improving performance on MedMCQA and MedXpertQA by up to 12% and 8.2%, respectively. These findings call for re-examining RAG's role in medicine and highlight the importance of stage-aware evaluation and deliberate system design for reliable medical LLM applications."}

We systematically investigate the contamination sensitivity of 23 SLMs (270M to 4B parameters) across multiple model families by measuring susceptibility to syntactic and semantic transformation types during instruction tuning: syntactic transformations (character and word reversal) and semantic transformations (irrelevant and counterfactual responses), each applied at contamination levels of 25\\%, 50\\%, 75\\%, and 100\\%. Our results reveal fundamental asymmetries in vulnerability patterns: syntactic transformations cause catastrophic performance degradation, with character reversal producing near-complete failure across all models regardless of size or family, while semantic transformations demonstrate distinct threshold behaviors and greater resilience in core linguistic capabilities. Critically, we discover a ``\\textit{capability curse}\" where larger, more capable models become more susceptible to learning semantic corruptions, effectively following harmful instructions more readily, while our analysis of base versus instruction-tuned variants reveals that alignment provides inconsistent robustness benefits, sometimes even reducing resilience. Our work establishes three core contributions: (1) empirical evidence of SLMs' disproportionate vulnerability to syntactic pattern contamination, (2) identification of asymmetric sensitivity patterns between syntactic and semantic transformations, and (3) systematic evaluation protocols for contamination robustness assessment. These findings have immediate deployment implications, suggesting that current robustness assumptions may not hold for smaller models and highlighting the need for contamination-aware training protocols."}

To address these challenges, we propose \\textsc{SafeNlidb}, a novel privacy-security alignment framework for LLM-based NLIDB. The framework features an automated pipeline that generates hybrid chain-of-thought interaction data from scratch, seamlessly combining implicit security reasoning with SQL generation. Additionally, we introduce reasoning warm-up and alternating preference optimization to overcome the multi-preference oscillations of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), enabling LLMs to produce security-aware SQL through fine-grained reasoning without the need for human-annotated preference data.

In addition, prior studies have rarely explored staged strategies that integrate both annotation types. To address this gap, we present CLiFT-ASR, a cross-lingual fine-tuning framework that builds on Mandarin HuBERT models and progressively adapts them to Taiwanese Hokkien. The framework employs a two-stage process in which it first learns acoustic and tonal representations from phonetic Tai-lo annotations and then captures vocabulary and syntax from Han-character transcriptions. This progressive adaptation enables effective alignment between speech sounds and orthographic structures. Experiments on the TAT-MOE corpus demonstrate that CLiFT-ASR achieves a 24.88\\% relative reduction in character error rate (CER) compared with strong baselines.

A new challenge comes when entities play roles according to their act or attributes in certain context. Entity Role Detection is the task of assigning such roles to the entities. Usu- ally real-world entities are of types: person, lo- cation and organization etc. Roles could be con- sidered as domain-dependent subtypes of these types. In the cases, where retrieving a subset of entities based on their roles is needed, poses the problem of defining the role and entities having those roles. This paper presents the study of study of solving Entity Role Detection prob- lem by modeling it as Named Entity Recogni- tion (NER) and Entity Retrieval/Ranking task. In NER, these roles could be considered as mutually exclusive classes and standard NER methods like sequence tagging could be used. For Entity Retrieval, Roles could be formulated as Query and entities as Collection on which the query needs to be executed. The aspect of Entity Retrieval task, which is different than document retrieval task is that the entities and roles against which they need to be retrieved are indirectly described. We have formulated au- tomated ways of learning representative words and phrases and building representations of roles and entities using them. We have also explored different contexts like sentence and document. Since the roles depend upon con- text, so it is not always possible to have large domain-specific dataset or knowledge bases for learning purposes, so we have tried to exploit the information from small dataset in domain- agnostic way."}

To address this, we propose EduGuardBench, a dual-component benchmark. It assesses professional fidelity using a Role-playing Fidelity Score (RFS) while diagnosing harms specific to the teaching profession. It also probes safety vulnerabilities using persona-based adversarial prompts targeting both general harms and, particularly, academic misconduct, evaluated with metrics including Attack Success Rate (ASR) and a three-tier Refusal Quality assessment. Our extensive experiments on 14 leading models reveal a stark polarization in performance. While reasoning-oriented models generally show superior fidelity, incompetence remains the dominant failure mode across most models. The adversarial tests uncovered a counterintuitive scaling paradox, where mid-sized models can be the most vulnerable, challenging monotonic safety assumptions. Critically, we identified a powerful Educational Transformation Effect: the safest models excel at converting harmful requests into teachable moments by providing ideal Educational Refusals. This capacity is strongly negatively correlated with ASR, revealing a new dimension of advanced AI safety. EduGuardBench thus provides a reproducible framework that moves beyond siloed knowledge tests toward a holistic assessment of professional, ethical, and pedagogical alignment, uncovering complex dynamics essential for deploying trustworthy AI in education.

However, most of these benchmarks evaluate models primarily through multiple-choice or short-answer formats, which do not take the reasoning process into account. Although some benchmarks assess the reasoning process, their methods are often overly simplistic and only examine reasoning when answers are incorrect. This approach overlooks scenarios where flawed reasoning leads to correct answers. In addition, these benchmarks do not consider the impact of intermodal relationships on reasoning. To address this issue, we propose the Reasoning Process Tree Score (RPTS), a tree structure-based metric to assess reasoning processes. Specifically, we organize the reasoning steps into a reasoning tree and leverage its hierarchical information to assign weighted faithfulness scores to each reasoning step. By dynamically adjusting these weights, RPTS not only evaluates the overall correctness of the reasoning, but also pinpoints where the model fails in the reasoning. To validate RPTS in real-world multimodal scenarios, we construct a new benchmark, RPTS-Eval, comprising 374 images and 390 reasoning instances. Each instance includes reliable visual-textual clues that serve as leaf nodes of the reasoning tree. Furthermore, we define three types of intermodal relationships to investigate how intermodal interactions influence the reasoning process. We evaluated representative LVLMs (e.g., GPT4o, Llava-Next), uncovering their limitations in multimodal reasoning and highlighting the differences between open-source and closed-source commercial LVLMs. We believe that this benchmark will contribute to the advancement of research in the field of multimodal reasoning."}

To address this challenge, grounded in the hypothesis that human writing possesses distinctive stylistic patterns, we propose Human Language Preference Detection (HLPD).

Specifically, the sparse autoencoder (SAE) projects hidden states into a high-dimensional, near-monosemantic space; benefiting from this representation, we identify a copyright-sensitive subspace and clamp its activations during decoding.

Empirically, SRA achieves 2.4x better explainability compared to current baselines, and produces token-level explanations that are more faithful and human-aligned. In terms of fairness, SRA achieves competitive fairness across all measures, with second-best performance in detecting toxic posts targeting identity groups, while maintaining comparable results on other metrics. These findings demonstrate that incorporating human rationales into attention mechanisms can enhance interpretability and faithfulness without compromising fairness."}

Its success depends not only on the quality of the instruction data but also on the inherent capabilities of the LLM itself. Some studies suggest that even a small amount of high-quality data can achieve instruction fine-tuning results that are on par with, or even exceed, those from using a full-scale dataset. However, rather than focusing solely on calculating data quality scores to evaluate instruction data, there is a growing need to select high-quality data that maximally enhances the performance of instruction tuning for a given LLM. In this paper, we propose the Model Instruction Weakness Value (MIWV) as a novel metric to quantify the importance of instruction data in enhancing model's capabilities. The MIWV metric is derived from the discrepancies in the model's responses when using In-Context Learning (ICL), helping identify the most beneficial data for enhancing instruction tuning performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that selecting only the top 1\\% of data based on MIWV can outperform training on the full dataset. Furthermore, this approach extends beyond existing research that focuses on data quality scoring for data selection, offering strong empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of our proposed method."}

The lack of large, standardized datasets classifies Bengali as a low-resource language for emotion detection. Existing studies mainly employ classical machine learning models with traditional feature engineering, yielding limited performance. In this paper, we introduce a new Bengali emotion dataset annotated across eight emotion categories and propose two models for automatic emotion detection: (i) a hybrid Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) model (EmoBangHybrid) and (ii) an AdaBoost-Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) ensemble model (EmoBangEnsemble). Additionally, we evaluate six baseline models with five feature engineering techniques and assess zero-shot and few-shot large language models (LLMs) on the dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive benchmark for Bengali emotion detection.

However, explicit CoT methods rely on discrete token-level reasoning processes that are prone to error propagation and limited by vocabulary expressiveness, often resulting in rigid and inconsistent reasoning trajectories. Recent research has explored implicit or continuous reasoning in latent spaces, allowing models to perform internal reasoning before generating explicit output. Although such approaches alleviate some limitations of discrete CoT, they generally lack explicit mechanisms to enforce consistency among reasoning steps, leading to divergent reasoning paths and unstable outcomes. To address this issue, we propose EBM-CoT, an Energy-Based Chain-of-Thought Calibration framework that refines latent thought representations through an energy-based model (EBM). Our method dynamically adjusts latent reasoning trajectories toward lower-energy, high-consistency regions in the embedding space, improving both reasoning accuracy and consistency without modifying the base language model. Extensive experiments across mathematical, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly enhances the consistency and efficiency of multi-step reasoning in LLMs."}

LoGo leverages signals extracted from a single forward pass through LoRA adapters, to identify the most relevant adapters and determine their contributions on-the-fly.

While the overall intensity and categorical values of emotions in arguments have received considerable attention in the research community, we argue that the emotion an argument evokes in a recipient is subjective. It depends on the recipient's goals, standards, prior knowledge, and stance. Appraisal theories lend themselves as a link between the subjective cognitive assessment of events and emotions. They have been used in event-centric emotion analysis, but their suitability for assessing argument convincingness remains unexplored. In this paper, we evaluate whether appraisal theories are suitable for emotion analysis in arguments by considering subjective cognitive evaluations of the importance and impact of an argument on its receiver. Based on the annotations in the recently published ContArgA corpus, we perform zero-shot prompting experiments to evaluate the importance of gold-annotated and predicted emotions and appraisals for the assessment of the subjective convincingness labels. We find that, while categorical emotion information does improve convincingness prediction, the improvement is more pronounced with appraisals. This work presents the first systematic comparison between emotion models for convincingness prediction, demonstrating the advantage of appraisals, providing insights for theoretical and practical applications in computational argumentation."}

We introduce Protagonist Entity Recognition (PER), a task that identifies the organizations that anchor a news story and shape its main developments. To validate PER, we compare he predictions of Large Language Models (LLMs) against annotations from four expert annotators over a gold corpus, establishing both inter-annotator consistency and human-LLM agreement. Leveraging these findings, we use state-of-the-art LLMs to automatically label large-scale news collections through NER-guided prompting, generating scalable, high-quality supervision. We then evaluate whether other LLMs, given reduced context and without explicit candidate guidance, can still infer the correct protagonists.

We demonstrate that these spurious correlations induce hallucinations that are confidently generated, immune to model scaling, evade current detection methods, and persist even after refusal fine-tuning. Through systematically controlled synthetic experiments and empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs (including GPT-5), we show that existing hallucination detection methods, such as confidence-based filtering and inner-state probing, fundamentally fail in the presence of spurious correlations.

We also introduce a Multi-level Orchestration Evaluation Metric (MOEM) to comprehensively assess the performance and robustness from command-level and category-level perspectives. The SAOP achieves high accuracy and success rates across 240 voice commands, while LLM-based agents improve robustness against speech recognition errors and diverse or ambiguous free-form commands, demonstrating strong potential to support minimally invasive da Vinci robotic surgery."}

This approach decouples response latency from model capability, enabling systems that feel responsive while accessing the full power of large-scale models. We present ConvFill, a 360M parameter model trained on synthetic multi-domain conversations. Evaluation across multiple backend models shows that conversational infill can be successfully learned, with ConvFill achieving accuracy improvements of 36-42% over standalone small models of the same size while consistently retaining sub-200ms response latencies. Our results demonstrate the promise of this approach for building on-device conversational agents that are both immediately responsive and knowledgeable."}

We review modern GPU architectures (e.g. NVIDIA A100/H100, AMD Instinct MI250X/MI300) and key performance metrics of floating-point throughput, memory bandwidth, VRAM capacity. We show how these hardware capabilities affect radiology tasks: for example, generating reports or detecting findings on CheXpert and MIMIC-CXR images is computationally intensive and benefits from GPU parallelism and tensor-core acceleration. Empirical studies indicate that using appropriate GPU resources can reduce inference time and improve throughput. We discuss practical challenges including privacy, deployment, cost, power and optimization strategies: mixed-precision, quantization, compression, and multi-GPU scaling.

Each screenplay was represented by its title, Wikipedia summary, and full script. Long scripts were split into overlapping text chunks and encoded with the E5 sentence em bedding model. Then, the screenplay embed dings were classified using a logistic regression model.

On over twenty datasets spanning multiple languages, the representation sharpening framework proves consistently superior to traditional retrieval, setting a new state-of-the-art on the BRIGHT benchmark. We show that representation sharpening is compatible with prior approaches to zero-shot dense retrieval and consistently improves their performance.

In this work, we introduce a new reasoning data generation framework spanning diverse skills and levels of complexity with over 1M high-quality synthetic vision-centric questions. The dataset also includes preference data and instruction prompts supporting both offline and online RL. Our synthesis framework proceeds in two stages: (1) scale; and (2) complexity. Reasoning traces are then synthesized through a two-stage process that leverages VLMs and reasoning LLMs, producing CoT traces for VLMs that capture the richness and diverse cognitive behaviors found in frontier reasoning models. Remarkably, we show that finetuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B on our data outperforms all open-data baselines across all evaluated vision-centric benchmarks, and even surpasses strong closed-data models such as MiMo-VL-7B-RL on V* Bench, CV-Bench and MMStar-V. Perhaps most surprising, despite being entirely vision-centric, our data transfers positively to text-only reasoning (MMLU-Pro) and audio reasoning (MMAU), demonstrating its effectiveness. Similarly, despite not containing videos or embodied visual data, we observe notable gains when evaluating on a single-evidence embodied QA benchmark (NiEH). Finally, we use our data to analyze the entire VLM post-training pipeline. Our empirical analysis highlights that (i) SFT on high-quality data with non-linear reasoning traces is essential for effective online RL, (ii) staged offline RL matches online RL's performance while reducing compute demands, and (iii) careful SFT on high quality data can substantially improve out-of-domain, cross-modality transfer."}

Anchoring bias, a classic human judgment bias, offers a critical test case. While prior work shows LLMs exhibit anchoring, most evidence relies on surface-level outputs, leaving internal mechanisms and attributional contributions unexplored. This paper advances the study of anchoring in LLMs through three contributions: (1) a log-probability-based behavioral analysis showing that anchors shift entire output distributions, with controls for training-data contamination; (2) exact Shapley-value attribution over structured prompt fields to quantify anchor influence on model log-probabilities; and (3) a unified Anchoring Bias Sensitivity Score integrating behavioral and attributional evidence across six open-source models. Results reveal robust anchoring effects in Gemma-2B, Phi-2, and Llama-2-7B, with attribution signaling that the anchors influence reweighting. Smaller models such as GPT-2, Falcon-RW-1B, and GPT-Neo-125M show variability, suggesting scale may modulate sensitivity. Attributional effects, however, vary across prompt designs, underscoring fragility in treating LLMs as human substitutes. The findings demonstrate that anchoring bias in LLMs is robust, measurable, and interpretable, while highlighting risks in applied domains. More broadly, the framework bridges behavioral science, LLM safety, and interpretability, offering a reproducible path for evaluating other cognitive biases in LLMs."}

While prior benchmarks primarily focus on prompt injection attacks or analyze the vulnerabilities of LLM MCP interaction trajectories, limited attention has been given to the underlying system logs associated with malicious MCP servers. To address this gap, we present the first synthetic benchmark for evaluating LLMs ability to identify security risks from system logs. We define nine categories of MCP server risks and generate 1,800 synthetic system logs using ten state-of-the-art LLMs. These logs are embedded in the return values of 243 curated MCP servers, yielding a dataset of 2,421 chat histories for training and 471 queries for evaluation. Our pilot experiments reveal that smaller models often fail to detect risky system logs, leading to high false negatives. While models trained with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) tend to over-flag benign logs, resulting in elevated false positives, Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Reward (RLVR) offers a better precision-recall balance. In particular, after training with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), Llama3.1-8B-Instruct achieves 83% accuracy, surpassing the best-performing large remote model by 9 percentage points.

Among contemporary simulation techniques, the integration of large language models (LLMs) into educational research has emerged as a particularly versatile and scalable paradigm. LLMs afford a high degree of linguistic realism and behavioural adaptability, enabling agents to approximate cognitive processes and engage in contextually appropriate pedagogical dialogues. This paper presents a thematic review of empirical and methodological studies utilising LLMs to simulate student behaviour across educational environments. We synthesise current evidence on the capacity of LLM-based agents to emulate learner archetypes, respond to instructional inputs, and interact within multi-agent classroom scenarios. Furthermore, we examine the implications of such systems for curriculum development, instructional evaluation, and teacher training.

In this paper, we argue that the predominant approach of simply removing existing biases from models is not enough. Using a paradigm from the psychology literature, we demonstrate that LLMs can spontaneously develop novel social biases about artificial demographic groups even when no inherent differences exist. These biases result in highly stratified task allocations, which are less fair than assignments by human participants and are exacerbated by newer and larger models. In social science, emergent biases like these have been shown to result from exploration-exploitation trade-offs, where the decision-maker explores too little, allowing early observations to strongly influence impressions about entire demographic groups. To alleviate this effect, we examine a series of interventions targeting model inputs, problem structure, and explicit steering. We find that explicitly incentivizing exploration most robustly reduces stratification, highlighting the need for better multifaceted objectives to mitigate bias. These results reveal that LLMs are not merely passive mirrors of human social biases, but can actively create new ones from experience, raising urgent questions about how these systems will shape societies over time."}

However, this expansion has also exposed IoT networks to increasingly sophisticated security threats, including adversarial attacks targeting artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) to deliberately evade detection, induce misclassification, and systematically undermine the reliability and integrity of security defenses. To address these challenges, we propose a novel adversarial detection model that enhances the robustness of IoT IDS against adversarial attacks through SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)-based fingerprinting. Using SHAP's DeepExplainer, we extract attribution fingerprints from network traffic features, enabling the IDS to reliably distinguish between clean and adversarially perturbed inputs. By capturing subtle attribution patterns, the model becomes more resilient to evasion attempts and adversarial manipulations. We evaluated the model on a standard IoT benchmark dataset, where it significantly outperformed a state-of-the-art method in detecting adversarial attacks. In addition to enhanced robustness, this approach improves model transparency and interpretability, thereby increasing trust in the IDS through explainable AI."}

Previous work has shown that verifying the correctness of individual reasoning steps can further improve the performance and efficiency of LLMs on such tasks and enhance solution interpretability. However, existing verification approaches, such as Process Reward Models (PRMs), are either computationally expensive, limited to specific domains, or require large-scale human or model-generated annotations. Thus, we propose a lightweight alternative for step-level reasoning verification based on data-driven uncertainty scores. We train transformer-based uncertainty quantification heads (UHeads) that use the internal states of a frozen LLM to estimate the uncertainty of its reasoning steps during generation. The approach is fully automatic: target labels are generated either by another larger LLM (e.g., DeepSeek R1) or in a self-supervised manner by the original model itself. UHeads are both effective and lightweight, containing less than 10M parameters. Across multiple domains, including mathematics, planning, and general knowledge question answering, they match or even surpass the performance of PRMs that are up to 810x larger. Our findings suggest that the internal states of LLMs encode their uncertainty and can serve as reliable signals for reasoning verification, offering a promising direction toward scalable and generalizable introspective LLMs."}

While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have become a standard for this, they face a fundamental dilemma in continual learning. Reusing a single set of PEFT parameters for new tasks often leads to catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge. Conversely, allocating distinct parameters for each task prevents forgetting but results in a linear growth of the model's size and fails to facilitate knowledge transfer between related tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel adaptive PEFT method referred to as \\textit{Mixtures of SubExperts (MoSEs)}, a novel continual learning framework designed for minimal forgetting and efficient scalability. MoSEs integrate a sparse Mixture of SubExperts into the transformer layers, governed by a task-specific routing mechanism. This architecture allows the model to isolate and protect knowledge within dedicated SubExperts, thereby minimizing parameter interference and catastrophic forgetting. Crucially, the router can adaptively select and combine previously learned sparse parameters for new tasks, enabling effective knowledge transfer while ensuring that the model's capacity grows sublinearly. We evaluate MoSEs on the comprehensive TRACE benchmark datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that MoSEs significantly outperform conventional continual learning approaches in both knowledge retention and scalability to new tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance with substantial memory and computational savings."}

Our preliminary empirical results indicate that the image modality exactly contributes less to MMD. Upon this idea, we propose a new MMD method named RETSIMD. Specifically, we suppose that each text can be divided into several segments, and each text segment describes a partial scene that can be presented by an image. Accordingly, we split the text into a sequence of segments, and feed these segments into a pre-trained text-to-image generator to augment a sequence of images. We further incorporate two auxiliary objectives concerning text-image and image-label mutual information, and further post-train the generator over an auxiliary text-to-image generation benchmark dataset.

Meanwhile, in-context learning has been widely explored at inference time and demonstrated the ability to enhance model performance without weight updates.

HiMo-CLIP introduces two key components: a hierarchical decomposition (HiDe) module that extracts latent semantic components from long-form text via in-batch PCA, enabling flexible, batch-aware alignment across different semantic granularities, and a monotonicity-aware contrastive loss (MoLo) that jointly aligns global and component-level representations, encouraging the model to internalize semantic ordering and alignment strength as a function of textual completeness.These components work in concert to produce structured, cognitively-aligned cross-modal representations.

These summaries, typically of a legislative provision, are manually evaluated for hallucinations. We show that the rate of hallucination of legal information by leading closed-source LLMs is significantly associated with place. This suggests that the quality of legal solutions provided by these models is not evenly distributed across geography.

Hence, we proposed MENTOR: A MEtacognition-driveN self-evoluTion framework for uncOvering and mitigating implicit Risks in LLMs on Domain Tasks. To address the limitations of labor-intensive human evaluation, we introduce a novel metacognitive self-assessment tool. This enables LLMs to reflect on potential value misalignments in their responses using strategies like perspective-taking and consequential thinking. We also release a supporting dataset of 9,000 risk queries spanning education, finance, and management to enhance domain-specific risk identification. Subsequently, based on the outcomes of metacognitive reflection, the framework dynamically generates supplementary rule knowledge graphs that extend predefined static rule trees. This enables models to actively apply validated rules to future similar challenges, establishing a continuous self-evolution cycle that enhances generalization by reducing maintenance costs and inflexibility of static systems. Finally, we employ activation steering during inference to guide LLMs in following the rules, a cost-effective method to robustly enhance enforcement across diverse contexts. Experimental results show MENTOR's effectiveness: In defensive testing across three vertical domains, the framework substantially reduces semantic attack success rates, enabling a new level of implicit risk mitigation for LLMs. Furthermore, metacognitive assessment not only aligns closely with baseline human evaluators but also delivers more thorough and insightful analysis of LLMs value alignment."}

Akan"], "title": "Graph Representation-based Model Poisoning on the Heterogeneous Internet of Agents", "categories": ["cs.NI", "cs.CL"], "comment": "6 pages, 6 figures", "summary": "Internet of Agents (IoA) envisions a unified, agent-centric paradigm where heterogeneous large language model (LLM) agents can interconnect and collaborate at scale. Within this paradigm, federated learning (FL) serves as a key enabler that allows distributed LLM agents to co-train global models without centralizing data. However, the FL-enabled IoA system remains vulnerable to model poisoning attacks, and the prevailing distance and similarity-based defenses become fragile at billion-parameter scale and under heterogeneous data distributions. This paper proposes a graph representation-based model poisoning (GRMP) attack, which passively exploits observed benign local models to construct a parameter correlation graph and extends an adversarial variational graph autoencoder to capture and reshape higher-order dependencies. The GRMP attack synthesizes malicious local models that preserve benign-like statistics while embedding adversarial objectives, remaining elusive to detection at the server. Experiments demonstrate a gradual drop in system accuracy under the proposed attack and the ineffectiveness of the prevailing defense mechanism in detecting the attack, underscoring a severe threat to the ambitious IoA paradigm."}

Both approaches share a foundational assumption that scaling up model capacity and data volume leads to improved performance. However, we observe a \\textit{\\textbf{scaling paradox}} in TS models, revealing a puzzling phenomenon that larger models do \\emph{NOT} achieve better performance. Through extensive experiments on two model families across four scales (100M to 1.7B parameters) and diverse data (up to 6B observations), we rigorously confirm that the scaling paradox is a pervasive issue. We then diagnose its root cause by analyzing internal representations, identifying a phenomenon we call \\textit{few-layer dominance}: only a small subset of layers are functionally important, while the majority are redundant, under-utilized, and can even distract training. Based on this discovery, we propose a practical method to automatically identify and retain only these dominant layers. In our models, retaining only 21\\% of the parameters achieves up to a 12\\% accuracy improvement and a 2.7$\\times$ inference speedup. We validate the universality of our method on 8 prominent SOTA models (LLM4TS and TSFMs, 90M to 6B), showing that retaining less than 30\\% of layers achieves comparable or superior accuracy in over 95\\% of tasks."}

However, existing approaches rely on a mono-contextual paradigm that accumulates all information in a single, expanding context window, leading to context suffocation and noise contamination that limit their effectiveness on long-horizon tasks. We introduce IterResearch, a novel iterative deep-research paradigm that reformulates long-horizon research as a Markov Decision Process with strategic workspace reconstruction. By maintaining an evolving report as memory and periodically synthesizing insights, our approach preserves consistent reasoning capacity across arbitrary exploration depths. We further develop Efficiency-Aware Policy Optimization (EAPO), a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes efficient exploration through geometric reward discounting and enables stable distributed training via adaptive downsampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IterResearch achieves substantial improvements over existing open-source agents with average +14.5pp across six benchmarks and narrows the gap with frontier proprietary systems. Remarkably, our paradigm exhibits unprecedented interaction scaling, extending to 2048 interactions with dramatic performance gains (from 3.5\\% to 42.5\\%), and serves as an effective prompting strategy, improving frontier models by up to 19.2pp over ReAct on long-horizon tasks. These findings position IterResearch as a versatile solution for long-horizon reasoning, effective both as a trained agent and as a prompting paradigm for frontier models."}

Prior work explores confidence estimation for self-evaluating LLM-scorer systems, with confidence scorers estimating the likelihood of errors in LLM responses. However, most methods focus on single-step outputs and overlook the challenges of multi-step reasoning. In this work, we extend self-evaluation techniques to multi-step tasks, testing two intuitive approaches: holistic scoring and step-by-step scoring. Using two multi-step benchmark datasets, we show that stepwise evaluation generally outperforms holistic scoring in detecting potential errors, with up to 15% relative increase in AUC-ROC. Our findings demonstrate that self-evaluating LLM systems provide meaningful confidence estimates in complex reasoning, improving their trustworthiness and providing a practical framework for failure detection."}

Existing spatial MLLMs often rely on explicit 3D inputs or architecture-specific modifications, and remain constrained by large-scale datasets or sparse supervision. To address these limitations, we introduce SpatialThinker, a 3D-aware MLLM trained with RL to integrate structured spatial grounding with multi-step reasoning. The model simulates human-like spatial perception by constructing a scene graph of task-relevant objects and spatial relations, and reasoning towards an answer via dense spatial rewards. SpatialThinker consists of two key contributions: (1) a data synthesis pipeline that generates STVQA-7K, a high-quality spatial VQA dataset, and (2) online RL with a multi-objective dense spatial reward enforcing spatial grounding. SpatialThinker-7B outperforms supervised fine-tuning and the sparse RL baseline on spatial understanding and real-world VQA benchmarks, nearly doubling the base-model gain compared to sparse RL, and surpassing GPT-4o. These results showcase the effectiveness of combining spatial supervision with reward-aligned reasoning in enabling robust 3D spatial understanding with limited data and advancing MLLMs towards human-level visual reasoning."}

To accelerate this transformation, two fundamental building blocks are essential: high-quality datasets that enable agents to achieve complex and human-relevant goals, and robust evaluation methods that allow researchers and practitioners to rapidly enhance agent performance. In this paper, we introduce DigiData, a large-scale, high-quality, diverse, multi-modal dataset designed for training mobile control agents. Unlike existing datasets, which derive goals from unstructured interactions, DigiData is meticulously constructed through comprehensive exploration of app features, resulting in greater diversity and higher goal complexity. Additionally, we present DigiData-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating mobile control agents on real-world complex tasks. We demonstrate that the commonly used step-accuracy metric falls short in reliably assessing mobile control agents and, to address this, we propose dynamic evaluation protocols and AI-powered evaluations as rigorous alternatives for agent assessment. Our contributions aim to significantly advance the development of mobile control agents, paving the way for more intuitive and effective human-device interactions."}

Kleinberg and Mullainathan [KM24] proved that generation is achievable in surprisingly general settings. But their generator suffers from ``mode collapse,'' producing from an ever-smaller subset of the target. To address this, Kleinberg and Wei [KW25] require the generator's output to be ``dense'' in the target language. They showed that generation with density, surprisingly, remains achievable at the same generality.\n  Both results assume perfect data: no noisy insertions and no omissions. This raises a central question: how much contamination can generation tolerate? Recent works made partial progress on this question by studying (non-dense) generation with either finite amounts of noise (but no omissions) or omissions (but no noise).\n  We characterize robustness under contaminated enumerations: 1. Generation under Contamination: Language generation in the limit is achievable for all countable collections iff the fraction of contaminated examples converges to zero. When this fails, we characterize which collections are generable. 2. Dense Generation under Contamination: Dense generation is strictly less robust to contamination than generation. As a byproduct, we resolve an open question of Raman and Raman [ICML25] by showing that generation is possible with only membership oracle access under finitely many contaminated examples.\n  Finally, we introduce a beyond-worst-case model inspired by curriculum learning and prove that dense generation is achievable even with infinite contamination provided the fraction of contaminated examples converges to zero. This suggests curriculum learning may be crucial for learning from noisy web data."}
