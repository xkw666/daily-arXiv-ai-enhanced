However, the mechanism behind multilingual reasoning in LRMs is\nnot yet fully explored. To investigate the issue, we fine-tune multilingual\nLRMs with Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on translated versions of\nthe GSM$8$K and SimpleRL-Zoo datasets in three different languages: Chinese,\nKorean, and Ukrainian.

However, designing high-performing agentic systems\nremains challenging. Existing agent search methods suffer from three major\nlimitations: (1) an emphasis on optimizing agentic workflows while\nunder-utilizing proven human-designed components such as memory, planning, and\ntool use; (2) high evaluation costs, as each newly generated agent must be\nfully evaluated on benchmarks; and (3) inefficient search in large search\nspace. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive framework to address these\nchallenges. First, We propose a hierarchical search space that jointly models\nagentic workflow and composable functional components, enabling richer agentic\nsystem designs. Building on this structured design space, we introduce a\npredictive value model that estimates agent performance given agentic system\nand task description, allowing for efficient, low-cost evaluation during the\nsearch process. Finally, we present a hierarchical Monte Carlo Tree Search\n(MCTS) strategy informed by uncertainty to guide the search. Experiments on\nseven benchmarks, covering embodied, math, web, tool, and game, show that our\nmethod achieves an average performance gain of 8.34\\% over state-of-the-art\nbaselines and exhibits faster search progress with steeper improvement\ntrajectories.

While\nautomated systems for sexism detection have been developed, they still face two\nkey challenges: data sparsity and the nuanced nature of sexist language. Even\nin large, well-curated datasets like the Explainable Detection of Online Sexism\n(EDOS), severe class imbalance hinders model generalization. Additionally, the\noverlapping and ambiguous boundaries of fine-grained categories introduce\nsubstantial annotator disagreement, reflecting the difficulty of interpreting\nnuanced expressions of sexism. To address these challenges, we propose two\nprompt-based data augmentation techniques: Definition-based Data Augmentation\n(DDA), which leverages category-specific definitions to generate\nsemantically-aligned synthetic examples, and Contextual Semantic Expansion\n(CSE), which targets systematic model errors by enriching examples with\ntask-specific semantic features. To further improve reliability in fine-grained\nclassification, we introduce an ensemble strategy that resolves prediction ties\nby aggregating complementary perspectives from multiple language models. Our\nexperimental evaluation on the EDOS dataset demonstrates state-of-the-art\nperformance across all tasks, with notable improvements of macro F1 by 1.5\npoints for binary classification (Task A) and 4.1 points for fine-grained\nclassification (Task C)."}
