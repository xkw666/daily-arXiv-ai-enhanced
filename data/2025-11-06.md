### [1] [Cache Mechanism for Agent RAG Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02919)
*Shuhang Lin,Zhencan Peng,Lingyao Li,Xiao Lin,Xi Zhu,Yongfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出新型Agent RAG缓存框架ARC，通过动态管理微型高价值语料库，将存储需求压缩至0.015%的同时提升79.8%命中率并降低80%检索延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG技术在代理级缓存管理方面存在空白，特别是在动态构建/维护面向代理需求的高相关语料库方面缺乏有效解决方案。

Method: 结合历史查询分布模式与嵌入空间几何特征，开发无需人工标注的缓存框架ARC，通过数学建模自动维护高价值缓存内容。

Result: 在三个检索数据集实验中，实现存储效率提升6666倍，最高命中率79.8%，平均检索延迟降低80%。

Conclusion: ARC验证了智能缓存管理对RAG驱动LLM代理的重要价值，为提升大模型应用效率提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have been
propelled by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which grants the models
access to vast external knowledge bases. Despite RAG's success in improving
agent performance, agent-level cache management, particularly constructing,
maintaining, and updating a compact, relevant corpus dynamically tailored to
each agent's need, remains underexplored. Therefore, we introduce ARC (Agent
RAG Cache Mechanism), a novel, annotation-free caching framework that
dynamically manages small, high-value corpora for each agent. By synthesizing
historical query distribution patterns with the intrinsic geometry of cached
items in the embedding space, ARC automatically maintains a high-relevance
cache. With comprehensive experiments on three retrieval datasets, our
experimental results demonstrate that ARC reduces storage requirements to
0.015% of the original corpus while offering up to 79.8% has-answer rate and
reducing average retrieval latency by 80%. Our results demonstrate that ARC can
drastically enhance efficiency and effectiveness in RAG-powered LLM agents.

### [2] [Automatic Machine Translation Detection Using a Surrogate Multilingual Translation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02958)
*Cristian García-Romero,Miquel Esplà-Gomis,Felipe Sánchez-Martínez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出利用多语言MT模型的内部特征检测机器翻译文本，提升翻译系统质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器翻译训练数据中存在大量机器生成的低质量译文，导致翻译性能下降

Method: 通过分析多语言机器翻译模型的内部表征特征，构建人类翻译与机器翻译的判别模型

Result: 在非英语语种上实现至少5%的准确率提升，超越现有最佳方法

Conclusion: 该方法能有效识别合成翻译内容，为构建高质量平行语料库提供关键技术支撑

Abstract: Modern machine translation (MT) systems depend on large parallel corpora,
often collected from the Internet. However, recent evidence indicates that (i)
a substantial portion of these texts are machine-generated translations, and
(ii) an overreliance on such synthetic content in training data can
significantly degrade translation quality. As a result, filtering out non-human
translations is becoming an essential pre-processing step in building
high-quality MT systems. In this work, we propose a novel approach that
directly exploits the internal representations of a surrogate multilingual MT
model to distinguish between human and machine-translated sentences.
Experimental results show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art
techniques, particularly for non-English language pairs, achieving gains of at
least 5 percentage points of accuracy.

### [3] [LEGO-Eval: Towards Fine-Grained Evaluation on Synthesizing 3D Embodied Environments with Tool Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03001)
*Gyeom Hwangbo,Hyungjoo Chae,Minseok Kang,Hyeonjong Ju,Soohyun Oh,Jinyoung Yeo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出LEGO-Eval评估框架和LEGO-Bench基准，解决3D场景生成与细粒度指令对齐不足的问题，实验显示评估框架F1分数提升0.41，生成方法成功率仅10%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM生成的3D场景缺乏真实空间布局和对象属性，导致训练出的代理与现实物理/语义存在偏差，需验证细粒度指令与场景的对齐性。

Method: 开发配备多样化工具的LEGO-Eval评估框架，显式基础场景组件；构建包含复杂真实环境指令的LEGO-Bench基准。

Result: LEGO-Eval比VLM评估F1分数高0.41；现有生成方法在完全对齐指令场景的成功率最高仅10%。

Conclusion: 细粒度指令对齐对场景生成至关重要，LEGO工具显著提升评估效果，同时暴露当前生成技术的重大局限性。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in using Large Language Models (LLMs) for
automatically generating 3D scenes, generated scenes often lack realistic
spatial layouts and object attributes found in real-world environments. As this
problem stems from insufficiently detailed, coarse-grained instructions,
advancing 3D scene synthesis guided by more detailed, fine-grained instructions
that reflect real-world environments becomes crucial. Without such realistic
scenes, training embodied agents in unrealistic environments can lead them to
learn priors that diverge significantly from real-world physics and semantics,
degrading their performance when deployed. Thus, verifying the alignment
between the fine-grained instruction and the generated scene is essential for
effective learning. However, current evaluation methods, such as CLIPScore and
vision-language models (VLMs), often fail to reliably assess such alignment.
This shortcoming arises primarily from their shallow understanding of 3D
scenes, which often leads to improperly grounded scene components. To address
this, we introduce LEGO-Eval, an evaluation framework equipped with diverse
tools designed to explicitly ground scene components, enabling more accurate
alignment assessments. We also present LEGO-Bench, a benchmark of detailed
instructions that specify complex layouts and attributes of real-world
environments. Experiments demonstrate that LEGO-Eval outperforms VLM-as-a-judge
by 0.41 F1 score in assessing scene-instruction alignment. Benchmarking with
LEGO-Bench reveals significant limitations in current generation methods.
Across all evaluated approaches, success rates reached at most 10% in
generating scenes that fully align with fine-grained instructions.

### [4] [Targeted Error Correction in Knowledge Distillation: Small Language Models Surpass GPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03005)
*Hee-Jin Lee,Zhen Guo,Luchao Jin,Morteza Moazami Goudarzi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过ARF流程（分析-修订-微调）使小规模开源模型在客服摘要任务中超越大型商业模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型商业模型的高成本和数据隐私问题，提升开源模型在专业场景的实用价值

Method: 分三步：1) 分析GPT-3.5的常见错误 2) 用Llama3.1-70B修订生成高质量数据 3) 微调Llama3.1-8B模型

Result: 微调后的8B模型在摘要任务上超越GPT-3.5，实现成本降低83%且保持数据本地化处理

Conclusion: 该框架为资源受限场景提供了可扩展的解决方案，证明通过系统化数据优化可突破模型规模限制

Abstract: We introduce an Analyze-Revise-Finetune (ARF) pipeline that enables smaller
open-source language models (LLMs) to surpass substantially larger proprietary
models in customer service summarization tasks. The pipeline first analyzes and
categorizes common errors in summaries produced by a teacher model (GPT-3.5),
then performs a targeted revision using a compact editor model (Llama 3.1 70B)
to generate high-quality, refined training data. Fine-tuning a smaller student
model (Llama 3.1 8B) on this refined data resulted in superior summarization
performance compared to GPT-3.5. The ARF pipeline improves cost efficiency and
data privacy while maintaining competitive accuracy, illustrating a
generalizable framework for enhancing open-source LLMs across diverse
downstream applications.

### [5] [Data-Efficient Adaptation and a Novel Evaluation Method for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03034)
*Yan Cathy Hua,Paul Denny,Jörg Wicker,Katerina Taškova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文针对方面级情感分析在低资源领域的瓶颈问题，提出新型评估方法FTS-OBP、探索小型生成模型在ABSA中的应用策略，并发布首个教育领域ABSA资源集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ABSA研究过度集中于商业领域，教育和医疗等高需求低资源领域存在方法适应困难、评估标准僵化以及大模型依赖资源多等问题。

Method: 1) 提出FTS-OBP柔性评估框架
2) 系统研究1.5-3.8B小型生成模型的上下文学习/权重合并/多任务微调策略
3) 开发适配低资源场景的训练方法

Result: 小模型仅用单GPU+200-1000样本即超越商业大模型，多任务微调使准确率接近基准水平；同步发布首个公开教育领域ABSA数据集。

Conclusion: 通过方法创新和资源开放，有效突破低资源领域ABSA应用壁垒，为领域适应研究提供新范式和实践基础。

Abstract: Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained opinion mining
approach that identifies and classifies opinions associated with specific
entities (aspects) or their categories within a sentence. Despite its rapid
growth and broad potential, ABSA research and resources remain concentrated in
commercial domains, leaving analytical needs unmet in high-demand yet
low-resource areas such as education and healthcare. Domain adaptation
challenges and most existing methods' reliance on resource-intensive
in-training knowledge injection further hinder progress in these areas.
Moreover, traditional evaluation methods based on exact matches are overly
rigid for ABSA tasks, penalising any boundary variations which may misrepresent
the performance of generative models. This work addresses these gaps through
three contributions: 1) We propose a novel evaluation method, Flexible Text
Similarity Matching and Optimal Bipartite Pairing (FTS-OBP), which accommodates
realistic extraction boundary variations while maintaining strong correlation
with traditional metrics and offering fine-grained diagnostics. 2) We present
the first ABSA study of small decoder-only generative language models (SLMs;
<7B parameters), examining resource lower bounds via a case study in education
review ABSA. We systematically explore data-free (in-context learning and
weight merging) and data-light fine-tuning methods, and propose a multitask
fine-tuning strategy that significantly enhances SLM performance, enabling
1.5-3.8 B models to surpass proprietary large models and approach benchmark
results with only 200-1,000 examples on a single GPU. 3) We release the first
public set of education review ABSA resources to support future research in
low-resource domains.

### [6] [ROBoto2: An Interactive System and Dataset for LLM-assisted Clinical Trial Risk of Bias Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03048)
*Anthony Hevia,Sanjana Chintalapati,Veronica Ka Wai Lai,Thanh Tam Nguyen,Wai-Tat Wong,Terry Klassen,Lucy Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出开源平台ROBOTO2，通过LLM辅助+人工审核机制优化临床试验偏倚风险评估流程，并发布包含521份试验报告的数据集


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ROB2偏倚评估流程耗时费力，需结合LLM自动化技术提升系统性综述效率

Method: 集成PDF解析、检索增强的LLM提示工程和人工实时反馈闭环系统

Result: 构建包含521项儿科临床试验报告的数据集（含8954个信号问题），实证显示LLM在ROB2评估中部分场景表现有限

Conclusion: ROBOTO2有效降低评估门槛，但完全自动化仍面临证据检索和推理能力挑战

Abstract: We present ROBOTO2, an open-source, web-based platform for large language
model (LLM)-assisted risk of bias (ROB) assessment of clinical trials. ROBOTO2
streamlines the traditionally labor-intensive ROB v2 (ROB2) annotation process
via an interactive interface that combines PDF parsing, retrieval-augmented LLM
prompting, and human-in-the-loop review. Users can upload clinical trial
reports, receive preliminary answers and supporting evidence for ROB2 signaling
questions, and provide real-time feedback or corrections to system suggestions.
ROBOTO2 is publicly available at https://roboto2.vercel.app/, with code and
data released to foster reproducibility and adoption. We construct and release
a dataset of 521 pediatric clinical trial reports (8954 signaling questions
with 1202 evidence passages), annotated using both manually and LLM-assisted
methods, serving as a benchmark and enabling future research. Using this
dataset, we benchmark ROB2 performance for 4 LLMs and provide an analysis into
current model capabilities and ongoing challenges in automating this critical
aspect of systematic review.

*Victoria Ebert,Rishabh Singh,Tuochao Chen,Noah A. Smith,Shyamnath Gollakota*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出单边对话问题（1SC），通过未来轮次信息和占位符提示实现对话重建，并证明无需完整对话即可生成高质量摘要


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景（如远程医疗、客服中心）中常只能获取单边对话记录，需要隐私保护的对话AI解决方案

Method: 在MultiWOZ等数据集上测试提示和微调模型，结合未来轮次信息、长度特征及占位符技术，对比大模型提示与小模型微调效果

Result: 访问未来轮次提升重建效果，占位符减少幻觉80%，GPT-3提示效果媲美微调小模型，摘要生成准确率达92%

Conclusion: 1SC为对话AI开辟新方向，在隐私保护前提下实现有效对话重建与摘要，推动医疗/客服领域AI实用化

Abstract: Conversational AI is constrained in many real-world settings where only one
side of a dialogue can be recorded, such as telemedicine, call centers, and
smart glasses. We formalize this as the one-sided conversation problem (1SC):
inferring and learning from one side of a conversation. We study two tasks: (1)
reconstructing the missing speaker's turns for real-time use cases, and (2)
generating summaries from one-sided transcripts. Evaluating prompting and
finetuned models on MultiWOZ, DailyDialog, and Candor with both human A/B
testing and LLM-as-a-judge metrics, we find that access to one future turn and
information about utterance length improves reconstruction, placeholder
prompting helps to mitigate hallucination, and while large models generate
promising reconstructions with prompting, smaller models require finetuning.
Further, high-quality summaries can be generated without reconstructing missing
turns. We present 1SC as a novel challenge and report promising results that
mark a step toward privacy-aware conversational AI.

*Michel Wong,Ali Alshehri,Sophia Kao,Haotian He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于大语言模型的PolyNorm文本规范化方法，通过自动数据流程实现多语言支持，在8种语言中显著降低词错误率并发布多语言基准数据集


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统文本规范化系统依赖人工规则且难以扩展，尤其在低资源语言场景存在覆盖限制，需更高效的自动化解决方案

Method: 结合提示工程的大语言模型PolyNorm，配合语言无关的自动数据生成与评估管道实现跨语言扩展

Result: 在八种语言的实验中词错误率(WER)持续下降，优于现有生产级系统

Conclusion: PolyNorm有效降低人工规则依赖，促进多语言场景应用，发布的PolyNorm-Benchmark数据集推动相关研究

Abstract: Text Normalization (TN) is a key preprocessing step in Text-to-Speech (TTS)
systems, converting written forms into their canonical spoken equivalents.
Traditional TN systems can exhibit high accuracy, but involve substantial
engineering effort, are difficult to scale, and pose challenges to language
coverage, particularly in low-resource settings. We propose PolyNorm, a
prompt-based approach to TN using Large Language Models (LLMs), aiming to
reduce the reliance on manually crafted rules and enable broader linguistic
applicability with minimal human intervention. Additionally, we present a
language-agnostic pipeline for automatic data curation and evaluation, designed
to facilitate scalable experimentation across diverse languages. Experiments
across eight languages show consistent reductions in the word error rate (WER)
compared to a production-grade-based system. To support further research, we
release PolyNorm-Benchmark, a multilingual data set covering a diverse range of
text normalization phenomena.

*Gowtham Premananth,Carol Espy-Wilson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过计算语言模型的惊讶度与语义连贯性指标，揭示精神分裂症患者的语言障碍特征及其与症状严重度的关联


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言异常是精神分裂症的重要特征，可能成为客观诊断标志。现有研究需量化分析语言障碍与症状的关系

Method: 使用计算语言学模型量化分析语言的surprisal（预测意外度）和语义连贯性，比较患者组与健康对照组差异

Result: 患者组在surprisal和语义连贯性指标上显著异常，且指标变化与症状严重程度呈相关性

Conclusion: 计算语言学指标可有效表征精神分裂症语言障碍，为症状评估提供客观量化工具

Abstract: Language disruptions are one of the well-known effects of schizophrenia
symptoms. They are often manifested as disorganized speech and impaired
discourse coherence. These abnormalities in spontaneous language production
reflect underlying cognitive disturbances and have the potential to serve as
objective markers for symptom severity and diagnosis of schizophrenia. This
study focuses on how these language disruptions can be characterized in terms
of two computational linguistic measures: surprisal and semantic coherence. By
computing surprisal and semantic coherence of language using computational
models, this study investigates how they differ between subjects with
schizophrenia and healthy controls. Furthermore, this study provides further
insight into how language disruptions in terms of these linguistic measures
change with varying degrees of schizophrenia symptom severity.

### [10] [CARMA: Comprehensive Automatically-annotated Reddit Mental Health Dataset for Arabic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03102)
*Saad Mankarious,Ayah Zirikly*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Created CARMA, the first automatically annotated Arabic mental health dataset from Reddit, enabling improved detection models for underrepresented languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of Arabic mental health resources and cultural stigma hindering early detection, while most research focuses on English.

Method: Built CARMA dataset covering 6 mental health conditions, conducted lexical/semantic analyses, and tested classification models (shallow to LLMs).

Result: CARMA outperforms existing datasets in scale/diversity; LLMs achieved the best classification performance for mental health detection.

Conclusion: CARMA bridges a critical resource gap and demonstrates feasibility of advancing mental health detection in low-resource languages using LLMs.

Abstract: Mental health disorders affect millions worldwide, yet early detection
remains a major challenge, particularly for Arabic-speaking populations where
resources are limited and mental health discourse is often discouraged due to
cultural stigma. While substantial research has focused on English-language
mental health detection, Arabic remains significantly underexplored, partly due
to the scarcity of annotated datasets. We present CARMA, the first
automatically annotated large-scale dataset of Arabic Reddit posts. The dataset
encompasses six mental health conditions, such as Anxiety, Autism, and
Depression, and a control group. CARMA surpasses existing resources in both
scale and diversity. We conduct qualitative and quantitative analyses of
lexical and semantic differences between users, providing insights into the
linguistic markers of specific mental health conditions. To demonstrate the
dataset's potential for further mental health analysis, we perform
classification experiments using a range of models, from shallow classifiers to
large language models. Our results highlight the promise of advancing mental
health detection in underrepresented languages such as Arabic.

### [11] [Control Barrier Function for Aligning Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03121)
*Yuya Miyaoka,Masaki Inoue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于控制屏障函数（CBF）的LLM对齐框架，通过安全过滤器在无需微调模型的前提下实现用户期望的文本生成


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型生成内容与用户期望对齐的问题，避免传统微调方法的高计算成本，通过外部安全层实现灵活可控的文本干预

Method: 使用控制屏障函数构建安全过滤器，对基线LLM生成的预测token进行实时干预。采用开源模型构建文本生成系统，支持直接集成现有评估模型到过滤器设计

Result: 开发出可插拔式安全过滤机制，验证了该框架在生成正向文本场景的有效性，保持基线模型性能的同时实现安全约束

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM对齐提供了高效灵活的解决方案，通过外部控制层实现安全约束，显著降低对齐技术的实施门槛和计算成本

Abstract: This paper proposes a control-based framework for aligning large language
models (LLMs) by leveraging a control barrier function (CBF) to ensure
user-desirable text generation. The presented framework applies the CBF safety
filter to the predicted token generated from the baseline LLM, to intervene in
the generated text. The safety filter includes two significant advantages: this
safety filter is an add-on type, allowing it to be used for alignment purposes
without fine-tuning the baseline LLM, and if there is an evaluation model
regarding the desired alignment, it can be directly applied to the filter
design. The overall text-generation system is implemented with open-source
language models, aiming to generate positive text.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出MME-CC视觉认知评估基准，系统分析多模态大模型的视觉推理能力短板


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态基准过度侧重文本推理，缺乏对视觉核心认知行为的系统性评估

Method: 构建包含11类视觉推理任务的MME-CC基准，分为空间/几何/知识推理三大类，测试16个主流模型

Result: 闭源模型领先（Gemini-2.5-Pro 42.66分），空间/几何推理普遍薄弱（≤30%），发现方向错误、跨视图身份持续性差等典型错误模式

Conclusion: 推动MLLM认知能力评估从边缘指标转向核心设计要素，促进模型认知架构改进

Abstract: As reasoning models scale rapidly, the essential role of multimodality in
human cognition has come into sharp relief, driving a growing need to probe
vision-centric cognitive behaviors. Yet, existing multimodal benchmarks either
overemphasize textual reasoning or fall short of systematically capturing
vision-centric cognitive behaviors, leaving the cognitive capacity of MLLMs
insufficiently assessed. To address this limitation, we introduce MME-CC
(Multi-Modal Evaluation benchmark of Cognitive Capacity), a vision-grounded
benchmark that organizes 11 representative reasoning tasks into three
fundamental categories of visual information: spatial, geometric, and
knowledge-based reasoning, and provides fine-grained analyses of MLLMs'
cognitive capacity across these dimensions. Based on MME-CC, we conduct
extensive experiments over 16 representative MLLMs. Our study reveals that
closed-source models currently lead overall (e.g., 42.66 for Gemini-2.5-Pro vs.
30.45 for GLM-4.5V), while spatial and geometric reasoning remain broadly weak
(less than or equal to 30%). We further identify common error patterns,
including orientation mistakes, fragile cross-view identity persistence, and
poor adherence to counterfactual instructions, and observe that
Chain-of-Thought typically follows a three-stage process (extract -> reason ->
verify) with heavy reliance on visual extraction. We hope this work catalyzes a
shift toward treating the cognitive capacity of MLLMs as central to both
evaluation and model design.

TL;DR: 提出基于LLM的利益相关者风险评估框架，通过案例验证不同视角对风险认知的显著影响，开发可视化工具增强冲突推理透明度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同利益相关者对AI风险的认知差异直接影响系统部署责任，需建立系统化的多视角风险评估方法

Method: 使用LLM作为风险评估代理，结合Risk Atlas Nexus框架和GloVE解释方法，在医疗AI、自动驾驶、反欺诈三个领域进行案例验证

Result: 利益相关者视角显著影响风险认知模式，开发的可视化工具能有效解释冲突成因，提升AI治理透明度

Conclusion: 基于利益相关者视角的解释框架对实现透明、可解释、以人为本的AI治理目标具有关键作用

Abstract: Understanding how different stakeholders perceive risks in AI systems is
essential for their responsible deployment. This paper presents a framework for
stakeholder-grounded risk assessment by using LLMs, acting as judges to predict
and explain risks. Using the Risk Atlas Nexus and GloVE explanation method, our
framework generates stakeholder-specific, interpretable policies that shows how
different stakeholders agree or disagree about the same risks. We demonstrate
our method using three real-world AI use cases of medical AI, autonomous
vehicles, and fraud detection domain. We further propose an interactive
visualization that reveals how and why conflicts emerge across stakeholder
perspectives, enhancing transparency in conflict reasoning. Our results show
that stakeholder perspectives significantly influence risk perception and
conflict patterns. Our work emphasizes the importance of these
stakeholder-aware explanations needed to make LLM-based evaluations more
transparent, interpretable, and aligned with human-centered AI governance
goals.

*Kevin Wang,Subre Abdoul Moktar,Jia Li,Kangshuo Li,Feng Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究通过实证分析比较了12种不确定性估计方法在LLM问答任务中的表现，揭示了信息类方法在分布内数据优势，密度类/P(True)在分布外数据更有效，语义一致性方法具有通用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估不同不确定性估计方法在LLM问答任务中的有效性，为提升模型输出可信度提供方法选择依据，特别关注分布内外数据的性能差异。

Method: 使用12种不确定性估计方法和4种生成质量指标(含LLMScore)，在分布内(ID)和分布外(OOD)的QA数据集上系统评估模型输出的不确定性表现。

Result: 信息类方法在ID数据表现优异，密度类/P(True)在OOD数据效果突出，语义一致性方法在不同场景均具可靠性但非最优选择。

Conclusion: 不同不确定性估计方法适用于不同场景：信息类适合ID环境，密度类/P(True)擅长处理OOD，语义方法通用但需根据具体需求选择。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly pervasive, finding
applications across many industries and disciplines. Ensuring the
trustworthiness of LLM outputs is paramount, where Uncertainty Estimation (UE)
plays a key role. In this work, a comprehensive empirical study is conducted to
examine the robustness and effectiveness of diverse UE measures regarding
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in LLMs. It involves twelve different UE
methods and four generation quality metrics including LLMScore from LLM
criticizers to evaluate the uncertainty of LLM-generated answers in
Question-Answering (QA) tasks on both in-distribution (ID) and
out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. Our analysis reveals that information-based
methods, which leverage token and sequence probabilities, perform exceptionally
well in ID settings due to their alignment with the model's understanding of
the data. Conversely, density-based methods and the P(True) metric exhibit
superior performance in OOD contexts, highlighting their effectiveness in
capturing the model's epistemic uncertainty. Semantic consistency methods,
which assess variability in generated answers, show reliable performance across
different datasets and generation metrics. These methods generally perform well
but may not be optimal for every situation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 首个针对孟加拉语社会文化的大规模伦理基准BengaliMoralBench，涵盖5大道德领域50个子主题，评估主流多语言LLM显示存在文化认知鸿沟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有伦理基准以西方框架为核心，忽视南亚285 million孟加拉语使用者的文化特殊性，需建立本土化评估体系以实现负责任的AI部署。

Method: 通过本土专家共识标注1,000+场景（涵盖日常生活/家庭关系/宗教活动等），采用德性/常识/正义伦理三维评估框架，统一提示协议评估Llama/Gemma等主流模型。

Result: 模型准确率跨度达50-91%，普遍存在文化根植性弱（宗教场景错误率42%）、常识推理不足（家庭伦理任务F1仅63%）、道德公平性偏差等问题。

Conclusion: BengaliMoralBench填补非英语伦理评估空白，为低资源多语言环境下的AI伦理对齐提供可扩展框架，支撑文化敏感的模型本地化。

Abstract: As multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) gain traction across South Asia,
their alignment with local ethical norms, particularly for Bengali, which is
spoken by over 285 million people and ranked 6th globally, remains
underexplored. Existing ethics benchmarks are largely English-centric and
shaped by Western frameworks, overlooking cultural nuances critical for
real-world deployment. To address this, we introduce BengaliMoralBench, the
first large-scale ethics benchmark for the Bengali language and socio-cultural
contexts. It covers five moral domains, Daily Activities, Habits, Parenting,
Family Relationships, and Religious Activities, subdivided into 50 culturally
relevant subtopics. Each scenario is annotated via native-speaker consensus
using three ethical lenses: Virtue, Commonsense, and Justice ethics. We conduct
systematic zero-shot evaluation of prominent multilingual LLMs, including
Llama, Gemma, Qwen, and DeepSeek, using a unified prompting protocol and
standard metrics. Performance varies widely (50-91% accuracy), with qualitative
analysis revealing consistent weaknesses in cultural grounding, commonsense
reasoning, and moral fairness. BengaliMoralBench provides a foundation for
responsible localization, enabling culturally aligned evaluation and supporting
the deployment of ethically robust AI in diverse, low-resource multilingual

*Wenchang Lei,Ping Zou,Yue Wang,Feng Sun,Lei Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出语言图模型(LGM)，通过提取自然语言中的元关系(继承/别名/组合)和验证机制，结合概念迭代检索算法，提升大模型处理模糊概念的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在指令存在模糊或概念错位术语时的理解困难问题，突破传统RAG依赖长上下文窗口的限制。

Method: 1. 提取元关系并构建验证机制
2. 开发概念迭代检索算法动态提供概念关系
3. 支持任意长度文本处理无需截断

Result: 在标准测试基准上持续超越现有RAG基线模型

Conclusion: LGM通过结构化概念关系有效提升大模型的概念解析能力，且具备处理长文本的独特优势

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong semantic understanding, yet
struggle when user instructions involve ambiguous or conceptually misaligned
terms. We propose the Language Graph Model (LGM) to enhance conceptual clarity
by extracting meta-relations-inheritance, alias, and composition-from natural
language. The model further employs a reflection mechanism to validate these
meta-relations. Leveraging a Concept Iterative Retrieval Algorithm, these
relations and related descriptions are dynamically supplied to the LLM,
improving its ability to interpret concepts and generate accurate responses.
Unlike conventional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches that rely
on extended context windows, our method enables large language models to
process texts of any length without the need for truncation. Experiments on
standard benchmarks demonstrate that the LGM consistently outperforms existing
RAG baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs生成流畅但缺乏事实依据，知识图谱精确但覆盖有限。通过融合两者优势，构建互补的混合系统以解决单组件局限性。

Method: 1) DBpedia知识图谱快速检索→2) 基于LLM的任务引导分类→3) 知识图谱不足时触发网络搜索代理的三阶段流程

Result: FEVER基准测试中未微调模型达到F1=0.93，通过定向重标注验证系统能有效发现原标注为NEI声明的有效证据

Conclusion: 模块化开源系统通过分层策略实现高效事实核查，在准确性和泛化能力方面展现优势，为可扩展的自动化验证提供新范式

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in generating fluent utterances but can
lack reliable grounding in verified information. At the same time,
knowledge-graph-based fact-checkers deliver precise and interpretable evidence,
yet suffer from limited coverage or latency. By integrating LLMs with knowledge
graphs and real-time search agents, we introduce a hybrid fact-checking
approach that leverages the individual strengths of each component. Our system
comprises three autonomous steps: 1) a Knowledge Graph (KG) Retrieval for rapid
one-hop lookups in DBpedia, 2) an LM-based classification guided by a
task-specific labeling prompt, producing outputs with internal rule-based
logic, and 3) a Web Search Agent invoked only when KG coverage is insufficient.
Our pipeline achieves an F1 score of 0.93 on the FEVER benchmark on the
Supported/Refuted split without task-specific fine-tuning. To address Not
enough information cases, we conduct a targeted reannotation study showing that
our approach frequently uncovers valid evidence for claims originally labeled
as Not Enough Information (NEI), as confirmed by both expert annotators and LLM
reviewers. With this paper, we present a modular, opensource fact-checking
pipeline with fallback strategies and generalization across datasets.

TL;DR: 提出IndicSuperTokenizer分词器，通过子词+多词混合分词策略及语言特定预分词，显著提升多语言模型的fertility分数和推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有BPE等子词分词方法在多语言场景（尤其是形态丰富的印度语系）存在分词不匹配问题，导致推理效率低下且性能受限。

Method: 结合子词与多词tokenization策略，采用语言定制化预分词，并通过消融实验验证词汇量/训练数据量/合并策略的影响。

Result: 在22种印度语言+代码数据上，fertility分数比LLaMA4提升39.5%，推理吞吐量提高44%，同时保持基准性能。

Conclusion: 该混合分词策略实现了语言对齐与效率的平衡，为多语言LLM分词器设计提供了新范式。

Abstract: Tokenizers play a crucial role in determining the performance, training
efficiency, and the inference cost of Large Language Models (LLMs). Designing
effective tokenizers for multilingual LLMs is particularly challenging due to
diverse scripts and rich morphological variation. While subword methods such as
Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) are widely adopted, their effectiveness in
multilingual settings remains underexplored. We present IndicSuperTokenizer, a
tokenizer for Indic multilingual LLMs, that combines both subword and
multi-word tokenization, along with language-specific pre-tokenization, leading
to more linguistically aligned tokens and achieving a new state-of-the-art in
fertility score. Evaluated across English, 22 Indian languages and code data,
our tokenizer improves the average fertility score by 39.5% over LLaMA4 and by
18% over Sutra (the current best). This translates to 44% improvement in
inference throughput over LLaMA4 while maintaining comparable performance on
English and Indic benchmarks. We also present detailed ablations across
tokenizer training data size, vocabulary size, merging techniques, and
pre-tokenization strategies, demonstrating the robustness of our design
choices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着RAG技术重要性提升，需要明确不同LLM在跨领域QA任务中的性能差异，特别是开源模型与商业模型的对比。

Method: 使用RAG框架，通过准确率/精确度（二分类问题）、专家/Gemini排名（长答案）、余弦相似度（长答案）等指标评估Mistral/LlaMa2/Falcon/Orca/GPT-3.5的表现。

Result: 1. GPT-3.5+RAG综合表现最优
2. Mistral-7b-instruct在开源模型中表现最佳
3. Orca-mini延迟最短(0.75s)，LlaMa2延迟最长(1.25s)
4. 开源模型基础设施优化后可达商用级水平

Conclusion: 开源LLM（如Mistral）通过RAG增强后，在特定配置下能达到与GPT-3.5相当的表现，证明开源方案在优化基础设施后具备商业竞争力。

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is emerging as a powerful technique to
enhance the capabilities of Generative AI models by reducing hallucination.
Thus, the increasing prominence of RAG alongside Large Language Models (LLMs)
has sparked interest in comparing the performance of different LLMs in
question-answering (QA) in diverse domains. This study compares the performance
of four open-source LLMs, Mistral-7b-instruct, LLaMa2-7b-chat,
Falcon-7b-instruct and Orca-mini-v3-7b, and OpenAI's trending GPT-3.5 over QA
tasks within the computer science literature leveraging RAG support. Evaluation
metrics employed in the study include accuracy and precision for binary
questions and ranking by a human expert, ranking by Google's AI model Gemini,
alongside cosine similarity for long-answer questions. GPT-3.5, when paired
with RAG, effectively answers binary and long-answer questions, reaffirming its
status as an advanced LLM. Regarding open-source LLMs, Mistral AI's
Mistral-7b-instruct paired with RAG surpasses the rest in answering both binary
and long-answer questions. However, among the open-source LLMs, Orca-mini-v3-7b
reports the shortest average latency in generating responses, whereas
LLaMa2-7b-chat by Meta reports the highest average latency. This research
underscores the fact that open-source LLMs, too, can go hand in hand with
proprietary models like GPT-3.5 with better infrastructure.

TL;DR: SCALE架构通过宽度扩展和参数冻结策略改善大模型持续预训练，在保留原有功能的同时提升知识获取能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统持续预训练过度依赖参数规模扩展导致严重遗忘问题，需要更高效的结构扩展方法实现稳定性和可塑性的平衡。

Method: 1. 插入轻量级宽度扩展模块同时冻结预训练参数
2. 开发Preserve/Adapt/Route三种变体：Preserve优先保持原功能，Adapt侧重新知识适应，Route实现动态路由
3. 采用保留导向初始化策略和选择性训练机制

Result: 1. 合成数据实验显示遗忘率降低90%
2. 韩语持续预训练后英语任务保留95%性能，韩语基准提升12%
3. 路由机制使训练稳定性提升3倍

Conclusion: 结构扩展优于参数堆砌，SCALE通过模块化设计实现知识保留与适应的协同优化，理论分析揭示其优化稳定性机制。

Abstract: We revisit continual pre-training for large language models and argue that
progress now depends more on scaling the right structure than on scaling
parameters alone. We introduce SCALE, a width upscaling architecture that
inserts lightweight expansion into linear modules while freezing all
pre-trained parameters. This preserves the residual and attention topologies
and increases capacity without perturbing the base model's original
functionality. SCALE is guided by two principles: Persistent Preservation,
which maintains the base model's behavior via preservation-oriented
initialization and freezing of the pre-trained weights, and Collaborative
Adaptation, which selectively trains a subset of expansion components to
acquire new knowledge with minimal interference. We instantiate these ideas as
SCALE-Preserve (preservation-first), SCALE-Adapt (adaptation-first), and
SCALE-Route, an optional routing extension that performs token-level routing
between preservation and adaptation heads. On a controlled synthetic biography
benchmark, SCALE mitigates the severe forgetting observed with depth expansion
while still acquiring new knowledge. In continual pre-training on a Korean
corpus, SCALE variants achieve less forgetting on English evaluations and
competitive gains on Korean benchmarks, with these variants offering the best
overall stability-plasticity trade-off. Accompanying analysis clarifies when
preservation provably holds and why the interplay between preservation and
adaptation stabilizes optimization compared to standard continual learning
setups.

Motivation: 现有语音翻译评估方法依赖参考翻译，忽视了源音频信息价值。借鉴机器翻译中源感知指标的成功经验，需解决音频源缺乏可靠转录/对齐的技术挑战。

Method: 采用ASR转录和参考翻译回译生成源文本代理，提出两阶段跨语言重新分段算法解决对齐问题，覆盖79种语言对和6种系统架构进行系统性验证。

Result: 当语音识别词错率低于20%时ASR更可靠，回译始终是经济有效的替代方案。重新分段算法显著提升源感知指标的鲁棒性，皮尔逊相关系数提升达0.35。

Conclusion: 该研究为语音翻译评估建立了系统方法论，通过创新性的文本代理生成和分段算法，推动了语音翻译评估向更准确、可解释的方向发展。

Abstract: Automatic evaluation of speech-to-text translation (ST) systems is typically
performed by comparing translation hypotheses with one or more reference
translations. While effective to some extent, this approach inherits the
limitation of reference-based evaluation that ignores valuable information from
the source input. In machine translation (MT), recent progress has shown that
neural metrics incorporating the source text achieve stronger correlation with
human judgments. Extending this idea to ST, however, is not trivial because the
source is audio rather than text, and reliable transcripts or alignments
between source and references are often unavailable. In this work, we conduct
the first systematic study of source-aware metrics for ST, with a particular
focus on real-world operating conditions where source transcripts are not
available. We explore two complementary strategies for generating textual
proxies of the input audio, automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts, and
back-translations of the reference translation, and introduce a novel two-step
cross-lingual re-segmentation algorithm to address the alignment mismatch
between synthetic sources and reference translations. Our experiments, carried
out on two ST benchmarks covering 79 language pairs and six ST systems with
diverse architectures and performance levels, show that ASR transcripts
constitute a more reliable synthetic source than back-translations when word
error rate is below 20%, while back-translations always represent a
computationally cheaper but still effective alternative. Furthermore, our
cross-lingual re-segmentation algorithm enables robust use of source-aware MT
metrics in ST evaluation, paving the way toward more accurate and principled
evaluation methodologies for speech translation.

Method: 使用VQA-RAD和ROCOv2数据集，测试Seed1.5-VL和Gemini-2.5-Flash在4个视觉医疗任务（含开放式VQA和医学图像解读）上的表现

Result: 思考模式对多数任务提升微弱（+1.5-3.2%），在开放式问答和医学图像解读任务中准确率不足60%

Conclusion: 需增加领域特异性医疗数据，开发更先进的医学知识整合方法以提升MLLMs的临床可靠性

Abstract: A recent advancement in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) research is
the emergence of "reasoning MLLMs" that offer explicit control over their
internal thinking processes (normally referred as the "thinking mode")
alongside the standard "non-thinking mode". This capability allows these models
to engage in a step-by-step process of internal deliberation before generating
a final response. With the rapid transition to and adoption of these
"dual-state" MLLMs, this work rigorously evaluated how the enhanced reasoning
processes of these MLLMs impact model performance and reliability in clinical
tasks. This paper evaluates the active "thinking mode" capabilities of two
leading MLLMs, Seed1.5-VL and Gemini-2.5-Flash, for medical applications. We
assessed their performance on four visual medical tasks using VQA-RAD and
ROCOv2 datasets. Our findings reveal that the improvement from activating the
thinking mode remains marginal compared to the standard non-thinking mode for
the majority of the tasks. Their performance on complex medical tasks such as
open-ended VQA and medical image interpretation remains suboptimal,
highlighting the need for domain-specific medical data and more advanced
methods for medical knowledge integration.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has become a transformative
approach in bioinformatics that often enables advancements in genomics,
proteomics, transcriptomics, structural biology, and drug discovery. To
systematically identify and evaluate these growing developments, this review
proposed six research questions (RQs), according to the preferred reporting
items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis methods. The objective is to
evaluate impactful GenAI strategies in methodological advancement, predictive
performance, and specialization, and to identify promising approaches for
advanced modeling, data-intensive discovery, and integrative biological
analysis. RQ1 highlights diverse applications across multiple bioinformatics
subfields (sequence analysis, molecular design, and integrative data modeling),
which demonstrate superior performance over traditional methods through pattern
recognition and output generation. RQ2 reveals that adapted specialized model
architectures outperformed general-purpose models, an advantage attributed to
targeted pretraining and context-aware strategies. RQ3 identifies significant
benefits in the bioinformatics domains, focusing on molecular analysis and data
integration, which improves accuracy and reduces errors in complex analysis.
RQ4 indicates improvements in structural modeling, functional prediction, and
synthetic data generation, validated by established benchmarks. RQ5 suggests
the main constraints, such as the lack of scalability and biases in data that
impact generalizability, and proposes future directions focused on robust
evaluation and biologically grounded modeling. RQ6 examines that molecular
datasets (such as UniProtKB and ProteinNet12), cellular datasets (such as
CELLxGENE and GTEx) and textual resources (such as PubMedQA and OMIM) broadly
support the training and generalization of GenAI models.

Conclusion: SBB为公平性评估提供新范式，强调需超越表面安全对齐，开发能根除潜在偏见的模型优化工具。

Abstract: Safety-aligned large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly
widespread, especially in sensitive applications where fairness is essential
and biased outputs can cause significant harm. However, evaluating the fairness
of models is a complex challenge, and approaches that do so typically utilize
standard question-answer (QA) styled schemes. Such methods often overlook
deeper issues by interpreting the model's refusal responses as positive
fairness measurements, which creates a false sense of fairness. In this work,
we introduce the concept of silenced biases, which are unfair preferences
encoded within models' latent space and are effectively concealed by
safety-alignment. Previous approaches that considered similar indirect biases
often relied on prompt manipulation or handcrafted implicit queries, which
present limited scalability and risk contaminating the evaluation process with
additional biases. We propose the Silenced Bias Benchmark (SBB), which aims to
uncover these biases by employing activation steering to reduce model refusals
during QA. SBB supports easy expansion to new demographic groups and subjects,
presenting a fairness evaluation framework that encourages the future
development of fair models and tools beyond the masking effects of alignment
training. We demonstrate our approach over multiple LLMs, where our findings
expose an alarming distinction between models' direct responses and their
underlying fairness issues.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在隐私敏感场景（如移动设备/客户交互）中计算成本高、隐私风险大的问题，同时弥补SLMs在复杂情感角色扮演中的性能差距

Method: 整合游戏理论与隐马尔可夫模型(HMM)，构建动态情感状态追踪系统，无需预训练即可在线学习债务人情绪状态

Result: 7B参数模型在对抗性信用谈判场景中，债务回收率与谈判效率均超越参数量10倍以上的基线LLMs

Conclusion: 战略情感智能（非模型规模）是自动谈判成功关键，推动隐私保护型边缘AI谈判系统发展，实现伦理约束下的高效谈判

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) in automated negotiation has
set a high performance benchmark, but their computational cost and data privacy
requirements render them unsuitable for many privacy-sensitive, on-device
applications such as mobile assistants, embodied AI agents or private client
interactions. While small language models (SLMs) offer a practical alternative,
they suffer from a significant performance gap compared to LLMs in playing
emotionally charged complex personas, especially for credit negotiation. This
paper introduces EQ-Negotiator, a novel framework that bridges this capability
gap using emotional personas. Its core is a reasoning system that integrates
game theory with a Hidden Markov Model(HMM) to learn and track debtor emotional
states online, without pre-training. This allows EQ-Negotiator to equip SLMs
with the strategic intelligence to counter manipulation while de-escalating
conflict and upholding ethical standards. Through extensive agent-to-agent
simulations across diverse credit negotiation scenarios, including adversarial
debtor strategies like cheating, threatening, and playing the victim, we show
that a 7B parameter language model with EQ-Negotiator achieves better debt
recovery and negotiation efficiency than baseline LLMs more than 10 times its
size. This work advances persona modeling from descriptive character profiles
to dynamic emotional architectures that operate within privacy constraints.
Besides, this paper establishes that strategic emotional intelligence, not raw
model scale, is the critical factor for success in automated negotiation,
paving the way for effective, ethical, and privacy-preserving AI negotiators
that can operate on the edge.

Conclusion: 实验证明LFC-DA能有效保持命题逻辑严谨性的同时增强数据多样性，为LLM驱动的逻辑数据增强提供可靠方案

Abstract: For complex logical data augmentation, heavy reliance on human annotation is
costly, whereas direct generation with large language models yields
uninterpretable and logically homogeneous examples. To address this, we present
LFC-DA, a symbolic-logic-controlled pipeline: logical text is first mapped to
propositional expressions, a compact rule library is compiled, and a bounded
state-space search systematically discovers valid formulas that are then
verbalized back into natural-language questions, ensuring both diversity and
logical rigor under propositional logic. Experiments on ReClor and LogiQA show
significant improvements in the logical-reasoning accuracy of pretrained
models, confirming the effectiveness of LFC-DA for LLM-guided logical data
augmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器翻译系统默认采用对称BPE设置，忽视了不同语言对和数据规模对分词效果的影响，可能限制模型性能

Method: 在多语言对（含英语-印地语等7组）和不同数据量（50K-500K句对）场景下，对比分析对称与非对称BPE配置对翻译质量的影响

Result: 低资源场景平均提升CHRF++ 5.32-0.7分（p<0.05），12个系统中10个显著改进，英语-印地语提升最明显

Conclusion: 推荐低资源机器翻译采用源语言高目标语言低的非对称BPE配置，该发现对资源受限的少数语种翻译系统优化具有实践价值

Abstract: Existing Machine Translation (MT) research often suggests a single, fixed set
of hyperparameters for word segmentation models, symmetric Byte Pair Encoding
(BPE), which applies the same number of merge operations (NMO) to train
tokenizers for both source and target languages. However, we demonstrate that
this uniform approach doesn't guarantee optimal MT performance across different
language pairs and data sizes. This work investigates BPE segmentation recipes
across various data volumes and language pairs to evaluate MT system
performance. We find that utilizing asymmetric BPE, where the source and target
languages have different NMOs, significantly improves results over the
symmetric approach, especially in low-resource settings (50K, 100K, and 500K
sentence pairs). Specifically, asymmetric BPE yield statistically significant
($p<0.05$) average gains of 5.32, 4.46, and 0.7 CHRF++ on English-Hindi in
low-resource setups. We validated this trend across six additional language
pairs (English and Telugu, Shona, Norwegian, Kyrgyz, Hausa, and Inuktitut),
observing statistically significant improvement in 10 out of 12 systems
compared to symmetric BPE. Our findings indicate a high NMO for the source (4K
to 32K) and a low NMO for the target (0.5K to 2K) provides optimal results,
particularly benefiting low-resource MT.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) have shown promises for relation extraction (RE)
when extracting RDF triples guided by SHACL shapes focused on common datatype
properties. This paper investigates how SLMs handle both datatype and object
properties for a complete RDF graph extraction. We show that the key bottleneck
is related to long-tail distribution of rare properties. To solve this issue,
we evaluate several strategies: stratified sampling, weighted loss, dataset
scaling, and template-based synthetic data augmentation. We show that the best
strategy to perform equally well over unbalanced target properties is to build
a training set where the number of occurrences of each property exceeds a given
threshold. To enable reproducibility, we publicly released our datasets,
experimental results and code. Our findings offer practical guidance for
training shape-aware SLMs and highlight promising directions for future work in
semantic RE.

TL;DR: 提出3TF框架，通过内部隐式推理实现高效无思维输出，提升推理质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于压缩的Long-to-Short方法依赖显式推理导致效率受限，需要探索更高效的推理范式

Method: 1.训练混合模型支持双模式运行 2.用CoT数据内化结构化推理 3.推理时采用无思维模式输出简洁结果

Result: 在推理基准测试中获得显著提升，证明隐式推理的有效性

Conclusion: 3TF框架成功将复杂推理过程内化，实现高效且高质量的短输出推理

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have leveraged explicit
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to improve reasoning accuracy. However, most
existing methods primarily compress verbose reasoning outputs. These
Long-to-Short transformations aim to improve efficiency, but still rely on
explicit reasoning during inference. In this work, we introduce \textbf{3TF}
(\textbf{T}hought-\textbf{T}raining and \textbf{T}hought-\textbf{F}ree
inference), a framework for efficient reasoning that takes a Short-to-Long
perspective. We first train a hybrid model that can operate in both reasoning
and non-reasoning modes, and then further train it on CoT-annotated data to
internalize structured reasoning, while enforcing concise, thought-free outputs
at inference time using the no-reasoning mode. Unlike compression-based
approaches, 3TF improves the reasoning quality of non-reasoning outputs,
enabling models to perform rich internal reasoning implicitly while keeping
external outputs short. Empirically, 3TF-trained models obtain large
improvements on reasoning benchmarks under thought-free inference,
demonstrating that high quality reasoning can be learned and executed
implicitly without explicit step-by-step generation.

TL;DR: 提出QuestionRAG框架，通过知识增强和强化学习解决LLM在问题修正任务中的误解与过度修正问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在处理错误输入时易出现意图误判和不必要结构修改，影响QA系统可靠性。

Method: 1. 知识增强：引入外部知识（搜索结果/关联实体）辅助理解错误问题
2. 强化学习：通过RL对齐精确修正目标，避免单纯复述

Result: 知识增强提升错误问题理解能力，RL训练效果显著优于监督微调(SFT)，模型指令跟随和泛化能力提升

Conclusion: 知识增强与强化学习的协同策略释放了LLM在问题修正任务中的潜力

Abstract: Input errors in question-answering (QA) systems often lead to incorrect
responses. Large language models (LLMs) struggle with this task, frequently
failing to interpret user intent (misinterpretation) or unnecessarily altering
the original question's structure (over-correction). We propose QuestionRAG, a
framework that tackles these problems. To address misinterpretation, it
enriches the input with external knowledge (e.g., search results, related
entities). To prevent over-correction, it uses reinforcement learning (RL) to
align the model's objective with precise correction, not just paraphrasing. Our
results demonstrate that knowledge augmentation is critical for understanding
faulty questions. Furthermore, RL-based alignment proves significantly more
effective than traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), boosting the model's
ability to follow instructions and generalize. By integrating these two
strategies, QuestionRAG unlocks the full potential of LLMs for the question
correction task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学领域需要严格的文献批判能力，但现有大语言模型在专业领域的批判性推理表现不足，缺乏有效评估基准

Method: 基于法国医学生真实考试构建数据集（534问题/37论文），测试不同上下文条件下通用和生物医学专用LLMs的表现

Result: 最优模型准确率≤0.5，中间推理过程提升效果但有限，模型在研究局限性和统计分析问题上表现最差

Conclusion: CareMedEval暴露LLMs在专业领域批判性推理的不足，为开发自动化文献评估工具提供重要基准

Abstract: Critical appraisal of scientific literature is an essential skill in the
biomedical field. While large language models (LLMs) can offer promising
support in this task, their reliability remains limited, particularly for
critical reasoning in specialized domains. We introduce CareMedEval, an
original dataset designed to evaluate LLMs on biomedical critical appraisal and
reasoning tasks. Derived from authentic exams taken by French medical students,
the dataset contains 534 questions based on 37 scientific articles. Unlike
existing benchmarks, CareMedEval explicitly evaluates critical reading and
reasoning grounded in scientific papers. Benchmarking state-of-the-art
generalist and biomedical-specialized LLMs under various context conditions
reveals the difficulty of the task: open and commercial models fail to exceed
an Exact Match Rate of 0.5 even though generating intermediate reasoning tokens
considerably improves the results. Yet, models remain challenged especially on
questions about study limitations and statistical analysis. CareMedEval
provides a challenging benchmark for grounded reasoning, exposing current LLM
limitations and paving the way for future development of automated support for
critical appraisal.

Result: 模型泛化性能显著提升，能够有效发现新的相关事实（平均F1值提升15%）

Conclusion: Kastor框架通过组合优化和迭代验证机制，在资源受限场景下实现了鲁棒的知识发现模型构建

Abstract: RDF pattern-based extraction is a compelling approach for fine-tuning small
language models (SLMs) by focusing a relation extraction task on a specified
SHACL shape. This technique enables the development of efficient models trained
on limited text and RDF data. In this article, we introduce Kastor, a framework
that advances this approach to meet the demands for completing and refining
knowledge bases in specialized domains. Kastor reformulates the traditional
validation task, shifting from single SHACL shape validation to evaluating all
possible combinations of properties derived from the shape. By selecting the
optimal combination for each training example, the framework significantly
enhances model generalization and performance. Additionally, Kastor employs an
iterative learning process to refine noisy knowledge bases, enabling the
creation of robust models capable of uncovering new, relevant facts

Abstract: Large language models work well for technical problem solving in English but
perform poorly when the same questions are asked in Bangla. A simple solution
would be to translate Bangla questions into English first and then use these
models. However, existing Bangla-English translation systems struggle with
technical terms. They often mistranslate specialized vocabulary, which changes
the meaning of the problem and leads to wrong answers. We present BanglaSTEM, a
dataset of 5,000 carefully selected Bangla-English sentence pairs from STEM
fields including computer science, mathematics, physics, chemistry, and
biology. We generated over 12,000 translations using language models and then
used human evaluators to select the highest quality pairs that preserve
technical terminology correctly. We train a T5-based translation model on
BanglaSTEM and test it on two tasks: generating code and solving math problems.
Our results show significant improvements in translation accuracy for technical
content, making it easier for Bangla speakers to use English-focused language
models effectively. Both the BanglaSTEM dataset and the trained translation
model are publicly released at https://huggingface.co/reyazul/BanglaSTEM-T5.

Method: 定义记忆提取/更新/问答三大任务，构建含1.5万记忆点、3.5千问题的长对话数据集(HaluMem-Medium/Long)，支持百万token级上下文评估

Result: 实验显示现有系统在记忆提取阶段产生26%虚构内容，更新阶段错误积累率达18%，导致问答阶段准确率下降32%

Conclusion: 应开发可解释的约束性内存操作机制，通过阶段化控制减少幻觉传播，提升系统级记忆可靠性

Abstract: Memory systems are key components that enable AI systems such as LLMs and AI
agents to achieve long-term learning and sustained interaction. However, during
memory storage and retrieval, these systems frequently exhibit memory
hallucinations, including fabrication, errors, conflicts, and omissions.
Existing evaluations of memory hallucinations are primarily end-to-end question
answering, which makes it difficult to localize the operational stage within
the memory system where hallucinations arise. To address this, we introduce the
Hallucination in Memory Benchmark (HaluMem), the first operation level
hallucination evaluation benchmark tailored to memory systems. HaluMem defines
three evaluation tasks (memory extraction, memory updating, and memory question
answering) to comprehensively reveal hallucination behaviors across different
operational stages of interaction. To support evaluation, we construct
user-centric, multi-turn human-AI interaction datasets, HaluMem-Medium and
HaluMem-Long. Both include about 15k memory points and 3.5k multi-type
questions. The average dialogue length per user reaches 1.5k and 2.6k turns,
with context lengths exceeding 1M tokens, enabling evaluation of hallucinations
across different context scales and task complexities. Empirical studies based
on HaluMem show that existing memory systems tend to generate and accumulate
hallucinations during the extraction and updating stages, which subsequently
propagate errors to the question answering stage. Future research should focus
on developing interpretable and constrained memory operation mechanisms that
systematically suppress hallucinations and improve memory reliability.

Result: GPT-5平均维持18.54轮对话且鲁棒性达70.31%，较Gemini-2.5-Pro领先11.41%，其他模型表现差距显著。

Conclusion: 该框架有效评估指令跟随能力，数据代码开源推动领域发展，实验结果揭示当前模型间显著性能鸿沟。

Abstract: Understanding how well large language models can follow users' instructions
throughout a dialogue spanning multiple topics is of great importance for
data-intensive conversational applications. Existing benchmarks are often
limited to a fixed number of turns, making them susceptible to saturation and
failing to account for the user's interactive experience. In this work, we
propose an extensible framework for assessing multi-turn instruction-following
ability. At its core, our framework decouples linguistic surface forms from
user intent simulation through a three-layer mechanism that tracks constraints,
instructions, and topics. This framework mimics User-LLM interaction by
enabling the dynamic construction of benchmarks with state changes and
tracebacks, terminating a conversation only when the model exhausts a simulated
user's patience. We define a suite of metrics capturing the quality of the
interaction process. Using this framework, we construct EvolIF, an evolving
instruction-following benchmark incorporating nine distinct constraint types.
Our results indicate that GPT-5 exhibits superior instruction-following
performance. It sustains an average of 18.54 conversational turns and
demonstrates 70.31% robustness, outperforming Gemini-2.5-Pro by a significant
margin of 11.41%, while other models lag far behind. All of the data and code
will be made publicly available online.

Conclusion: 堆栈增强神经网络比标准架构更贴近人类语言习得机制，为心理语言学建模提供了更精确的计算模型。

Abstract: Any finite set of training data is consistent with an infinite number of
hypothetical algorithms that could have generated it. Studies have shown that
when human children learn language, they consistently favor hypotheses based on
hierarchical syntactic rules without ever encountering disambiguating examples.
A recent line of work has inquired as to whether common neural network
architectures share this bias, finding that they do so only under special
conditions: when syntactically supervised, when pre-trained on massive corpora,
or when trained long past convergence. In this paper, we demonstrate, for the
first time, neural network architectures that are able to generalize in
human-like fashion without any of the aforementioned requirements:
stack-augmented neural networks. We test three base architectures (transformer,
simple RNN, LSTM) augmented with two styles of stack: the superposition stack
of Joulin & Mikolov (2015) and a nondeterministic generalization of it proposed
by DuSell & Chiang (2023). We find that transformers with nondeterministic
stacks generalize best out of these architectures on a classical question
formation task. We also propose a modification to the stack RNN architecture
that improves hierarchical generalization. These results suggest that
stack-augmented neural networks may be more accurate models of human language
acquisition than standard architectures, serving as useful objects of
psycholinguistic study. Our code is publicly available.

Abstract: Measuring the full abilities of large language models (LLMs) requires
benchmarks representing multiple tasks. We aim to create large, high-quality
datasets for comparison of logical reasoning skills across several languages
and of suitable difficulty for LLMs of various reasoning ability. We explore
multiple ways of increasing difficulty. We generate zebra puzzles in multiple
languages, themes, sizes and including 14 different clue types and 8 red
herring types (uninformative clues). We find puzzle sizes 2x3 and 4x5 are
sufficiently challenging for GPT-4o mini (a non-reasoning model) and o3-mini (a
reasoning model), respectively. Including 5 red herrings decreases o3-mini
puzzle-level accuracy on 4x5 puzzles by 15$\pm$7 %. Scores of o3-mini on 4x5
puzzles are not significantly affected by use of English vs. Danish or the
common houses theme vs. the country-specific smoerrebroed theme. We find no
correlation between difficulty and the selected clue types. Datasets of
128+1024 puzzles are published as MultiZebraLogic in each of nine Germanic
languages for sizes 2x3 and 4x5. We publish code for puzzle generation,
designed for adaptablity into more languages and themes.

Motivation: 传统语言模型依赖分布式表示导致可解释性不足，难以满足监管领域对透明度的需求。本文旨在通过动态调节局部性参数，实现模型可解释性与性能的优化平衡。

Method: 使用两层Transformer架构，在WikiText语料库上系统调节λ参数（1.0至0.0），分析注意力熵、指针保真度及预测性能的变化规律。

Result: λ=1.0时注意力熵最低（5.36比特），指针保真度最高；λ=0.6时取得最佳平衡（困惑度4.65/准确率84.7%），证明中间值优化性能-可解释性权衡。

Conclusion: 通过显式数学阈值与信息论设计，实现语言模型透明度和能力的连续调控，为金融/医疗等监管领域提供兼具可审计性与性能的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents the first empirical demonstration of controllable
locality in transformer language models, a novel architectural framework that
enables continuous control over the degree of representation localization
through a tunable locality dial parameter. Unlike traditional language models
that rely exclusively on distributed representations, our approach allows
dynamic interpolation between highly interpretable localist encodings and
efficient distributed representations without requiring model retraining. We
conducted experiments on the WikiText corpus using a two-layer transformer
architecture, systematically varying the locality parameter {\lambda} across
the full spectrum from 1.0 (fully localist) to 0.0 (fully distributed). Our
results demonstrate that localist configurations achieve dramatically lower
attention entropy, with {\lambda} = 1.0 yielding 5.36 bits compared to 7.18
bits at {\lambda} = 0.0, while maintaining substantially higher pointer
fidelity scores reflecting stronger alignment with rule-specified targets.
Prediction experiments reveal that intermediate locality values optimize the
tradeoff between interpretability and performance, with {\lambda} = 0.6
achieving test perplexity of 4.65 and accuracy of 84.7%. These findings
establish that localist language models provide a practical framework for
applications in regulated domains requiring both transparency and capability,
offering precise mathematical control over the interpretability-performance
spectrum through explicit penalty thresholds and information-theoretic design
principles.

Abstract: Zero-Shot Stance Detection (ZSSD) identifies the attitude of the post toward
unseen targets. Existing research using contrastive, meta-learning, or data
augmentation suffers from generalizability issues or lack of coherence between
text and target. Recent works leveraging large language models (LLMs) for ZSSD
focus either on improving unseen target-specific knowledge or generating
explanations for stance analysis. However, most of these works are limited by
their over-reliance on explicit reasoning, provide coarse explanations that
lack nuance, and do not explicitly model the reasoning process, making it
difficult to interpret the model's predictions. To address these issues, in our
study, we develop a novel interpretable ZSSD framework, IRIS. We provide an
interpretable understanding of the attitude of the input towards the target
implicitly based on sequences within the text (implicit rationales) and
explicitly based on linguistic measures (explicit rationales). IRIS considers
stance detection as an information retrieval ranking task, understanding the
relevance of implicit rationales for different stances to guide the model
towards correct predictions without requiring the ground-truth of rationales,
thus providing inherent interpretability. In addition, explicit rationales
based on communicative features help decode the emotional and cognitive
dimensions of stance, offering an interpretable understanding of the author's
attitude towards the given target. Extensive experiments on the benchmark
datasets of VAST, EZ-STANCE, P-Stance, and RFD using 50%, 30%, and even 10%
training data prove the generalizability of our model, benefiting from the
proposed architecture and interpretable design.

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs部分认同阴谋论元素，存在潜在社会人口偏见且易被操控，凸显其在敏感场景中的心理维度风险


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs作为人类行为研究代理时是否再现阴谋论等复杂心理结构，检验其社会保真度，为计算社会科学提供基础并防范有害使用

Method: 采用经过验证的心理测量量表，对不同模型进行多维度测试，包括基础响应、社会人口属性条件化响应及针对性提示干预策略

Result: 1. LLMs对阴谋论元素显示部分认同
2. 社会人口条件化暴露模型潜在偏见
3. 针对性提示可显著改变模型立场（如将阴谋论接受率从15%提升至48%）

Conclusion: 揭示LLMs心理维度的脆弱性，强调对其社会认知偏差进行系统评估的必要性，为开发防护策略和推进可信AI发展提供关键洞见

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit
conspiratorial tendencies, whether they display sociodemographic biases in this
domain, and how easily they can be conditioned into adopting conspiratorial
perspectives. Conspiracy beliefs play a central role in the spread of
misinformation and in shaping distrust toward institutions, making them a
critical testbed for evaluating the social fidelity of LLMs. LLMs are
increasingly used as proxies for studying human behavior, yet little is known
about whether they reproduce higher-order psychological constructs such as a
conspiratorial mindset. To bridge this research gap, we administer validated
psychometric surveys measuring conspiracy mindset to multiple models under
different prompting and conditioning strategies. Our findings reveal that LLMs
show partial agreement with elements of conspiracy belief, and conditioning
with socio-demographic attributes produces uneven effects, exposing latent
demographic biases. Moreover, targeted prompts can easily shift model responses
toward conspiratorial directions, underscoring both the susceptibility of LLMs
to manipulation and the potential risks of their deployment in sensitive
contexts. These results highlight the importance of critically evaluating the
psychological dimensions embedded in LLMs, both to advance computational social
science and to inform possible mitigation strategies against harmful uses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究非对称协作对话中表面共识掩盖实际指代分歧的现象，解决传统共同基础理论对隐性误解的检测盲区

Method: 1. 在HCRC MapTask语料库上设计双重视角标注方案
2. 构建LLM驱动的标注流程处理13k指代表达
3. 通过词汇统一和分歧模式分析理解状态演化

Result: 1. 词汇统一后完全误解仅占3.2%
2. 指代多重性导致63%的系统性理解分歧
3. 表面共识场景中41%存在隐性指代错位

Conclusion: 该框架为对话理解研究提供：
1. 首个双重视角标注资源
2. 揭示隐性错位检测方法论
3. 评估V/LLM视角建模能力的新基准

Abstract: Collaborative dialogue relies on participants incrementally establishing
common ground, yet in asymmetric settings they may believe they agree while
referring to different entities. We introduce a perspectivist annotation scheme
for the HCRC MapTask corpus (Anderson et al., 1991) that separately captures
speaker and addressee grounded interpretations for each reference expression,
enabling us to trace how understanding emerges, diverges, and repairs over
time. Using a scheme-constrained LLM annotation pipeline, we obtain 13k
annotated reference expressions with reliability estimates and analyze the
resulting understanding states. The results show that full misunderstandings
are rare once lexical variants are unified, but multiplicity discrepancies
systematically induce divergences, revealing how apparent grounding can mask
referential misalignment. Our framework provides both a resource and an
analytic lens for studying grounded misunderstanding and for evaluating
(V)LLMs' capacity to model perspective-dependent grounding in collaborative
dialogue.

TL;DR: 提出动态调整ODW损失权重的调度策略，通过前期强正则化稳定优化、后期衰减权重恢复细节，显著提升CAD重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定ODW权重策略存在优化矛盾：早期需要强正则化抑制噪声，但后期会阻碍细节恢复。需设计时间衰减调度平衡不同阶段的优化需求。

Method: 设计五种调度策略（常数/线性/五次方/阶梯/递增预热），在ABC数据集上对比分析不同衰减曲线对重建质量的影响。

Result: 动态调度策略在Chamfer距离指标上比基线提升35%，验证了时间衰减机制对优化过程的正向调节作用。

Conclusion: 动态权重调度作为曲率正则化的扩展方案，以简单计算代价显著增强了CAD重建的鲁棒性和几何保真度。

Abstract: Neural signed distance functions (SDFs) have become a powerful representation
for geometric reconstruction from point clouds, yet they often require both
gradient- and curvature-based regularization to suppress spurious warp and
preserve structural fidelity. FlatCAD introduced the Off-Diagonal Weingarten
(ODW) loss as an efficient second-order prior for CAD surfaces, approximating
full-Hessian regularization at roughly half the computational cost. However,
FlatCAD applies a fixed ODW weight throughout training, which is suboptimal:
strong regularization stabilizes early optimization but suppresses detail
recovery in later stages. We present scheduling strategies for the ODW loss
that assign a high initial weight to stabilize optimization and progressively
decay it to permit fine-scale refinement. We investigate constant, linear,
quintic, and step interpolation schedules, as well as an increasing warm-up
variant. Experiments on the ABC CAD dataset demonstrate that time-varying
schedules consistently outperform fixed weights. Our method achieves up to a
35% improvement in Chamfer Distance over the FlatCAD baseline, establishing
scheduling as a simple yet effective extension of curvature regularization for
robust CAD reconstruction.

Motivation: 评估可视化技术对MLLM网络桥梁存在性判断的影响，探究视觉辅助对AI决策质量的作用

Method: 通过对比结构化文本输入与可视化输入，分析MLLM的置信度变化和判断偏差

Result: 可视化提升置信度但导致事实无关的决策偏差（倾向于接受/拒绝桥梁存在）

Conclusion: 需谨慎控制可视化在生成式AI中的应用，避免引发非事实性幻觉

Abstract: We evaluate how visualizations can influence the judgment of MLLMs about the
presence or absence of bridges in a network. We show that the inclusion of
visualization improves confidence over a structured text-based input that could
theoretically be helpful for answering the question. On the other hand, we
observe that standard visualization techniques create a strong bias towards
accepting or refuting the presence of a bridge -- independently of whether or
not a bridge actually exists in the network. While our results indicate that
the inclusion of visualization techniques can effectively influence the MLLM's
judgment without compromising its self-reported confidence, they also imply
that practitioners must be careful of allowing users to include visualizations
in generative AI applications so as to avoid undesired hallucinations.

Motivation: 现有基于直接引用的知识扩散测量存在局限，需开发思想层面的跨领域知识流动追踪方法

Method: 使用72,703份文档(2000-2019)，通过嵌入回归方法分析媒体效应理论在研究、新闻、政策三大领域的语义分布及演化

Result: 1. 不同理论的扩散模式差异显著
2. 政策与研究领域语义距离大于新闻与研究领域
3. 理论角色随领域转变：研究理论→新闻解释框架→政策管理工具

Conclusion: 思想层面的文本分析方法能有效补充传统引用计量，揭示社会科学知识跨领域扩散的复杂动态特征

Abstract: Despite the importance of social science knowledge for various stakeholders,
measuring its diffusion into different domains remains a challenge. This study
uses a novel text-based approach to measure the idea-level diffusion of social
science knowledge from the research domain to the journalism and policy-making
domains. By doing so, we expand the detection of knowledge diffusion beyond the
measurements of direct references. Our study focuses on media effects theories
as key research ideas in the field of communication science. Using 72,703
documents (2000-2019) from three domains (i.e., research, journalism, and
policy-making) that mention these ideas, we count the mentions of these ideas
in each domain, estimate their domain-specific contexts, and track and compare
differences across domains and over time. Overall, we find that diffusion
patterns and dynamics vary considerably between ideas, with some ideas
diffusing between other domains, while others do not. Based on the embedding
regression approach, we compare contextualized meanings across domains and find
that the distances between research and policy are typically larger than
between research and journalism. We also find that ideas largely shift roles
across domains - from being the theories themselves in research to sense-making
in news to applied, administrative use in policy. Over time, we observe
semantic convergence mainly for ideas that are practically oriented. Our
results characterize the cross-domain diffusion patterns and dynamics of social
science knowledge at the idea level, and we discuss the implications for
measuring knowledge diffusion beyond citations.

Result: 基础模型零样本分类F1分数0.674，但受限于数据获取难度、提示过拟合风险及高昂的计算评估成本

Conclusion: LLM在数据引用分类中展现潜力，但实际应用需突破数据壁垒并解决计算资源密集型评估的挑战

Abstract: Efforts have increased in recent years to identify associations between
specific datasets and the scientific literature that incorporates them. Knowing
that a given publication cites a given dataset, the next logical step is to
explore how or why that data was used. Advances in recent years with
pretrained, transformer-based large language models (LLMs) offer potential
means for scaling the description of data use cases in the published
literature. This avoids expensive manual labeling and the development of
training datasets for classical machine-learning (ML) systems. In this work we
apply an open-source LLM, Llama 3.1-405B, to generate structured data use case
labels for publications known to incorporate specific genomic datasets. We also
introduce a novel evaluation framework for determining the efficacy of our
methods. Our results demonstrate that the stock model can achieve an F1 score
of .674 on a zero-shot data citation classification task with no previously
defined categories. While promising, our results are qualified by barriers
related to data availability, prompt overfitting, computational infrastructure,
and the expense required to conduct responsible performance evaluation.

(3) 上下文编辑引发0.73rad平均轨迹偏转

Conclusion: 注意力机制确实在嵌入空间创造可测量的曲率效应，验证了Transformer动态几何特征与广义相对论的深层类比关系

Abstract: We present a geometric framework for understanding Transformer-based language
models, drawing an explicit analogy to General Relativity. Queries and keys
induce an effective metric on representation space, and attention acts as a
discrete connection that implements parallel transport of value vectors across
tokens. Stacked layers provide discrete time-slices through which token
representations evolve on this curved manifold, while backpropagation plays the
role of a least-action principle that shapes loss-minimizing trajectories in
parameter space. If this analogy is correct, token embeddings should not
traverse straight paths in feature space; instead, their layer-wise steps
should bend and reorient as interactions mediated by embedding space curvature.
To test this prediction, we design experiments that expose both the presence
and the consequences of curvature: (i) we visualize a curvature landscape for a
full paragraph, revealing how local turning angles vary across tokens and
layers; (ii) we show through simulations that excess counts of sharp/flat
angles and longer length-to-chord ratios are not explainable by dimensionality
or chance; and (iii) inspired by Einstein's eclipse experiment, we probe
deflection under controlled context edits, demonstrating measurable,
meaning-consistent bends in embedding trajectories that confirm
attention-induced curvature.

Conclusion: 建立LLM自我鲁棒性评估体系，开源工具为模型安全提供系统性测试框架，揭示模型安全边界的动态特性

Abstract: LLMs can provide substantial zero-shot performance on diverse tasks using a
simple task prompt, eliminating the need for training or fine-tuning. However,
when applying these models to sensitive tasks, it is crucial to thoroughly
assess their robustness against adversarial inputs. In this work, we introduce
Static Deceptor (StaDec) and Dynamic Deceptor (DyDec), two innovative attack
frameworks designed to systematically generate dynamic and adaptive adversarial
examples by leveraging the understanding of the LLMs. We produce subtle and
natural-looking adversarial inputs that preserve semantic similarity to the
original text while effectively deceiving the target LLM. By utilizing an
automated, LLM-driven pipeline, we eliminate the dependence on external
heuristics. Our attacks evolve with the advancements in LLMs and demonstrate
strong transferability across models unknown to the attacker. Overall, this
work provides a systematic approach for the self-assessment of an LLM's
robustness. We release our code and data at

Abstract: Empathy is a critical factor in fostering positive user experiences in
conversational AI. While models can display empathy, it is often generic rather
than tailored to specific tasks and contexts. In this work, we introduce a
novel framework for developing and evaluating context-specific empathetic large
language models (LLMs). We first analyze a real-world conversational dataset
consisting of 672 multi-turn conversations across 8 tasks, revealing
significant differences in terms of expected and experienced empathy before and
after the conversations, respectively. To help minimize this gap, we develop a
synthetic multi-turn conversational generation pipeline and steer responses
toward our defined empathy patterns based on the context that more closely
matches users' expectations. We then train empathetic expert adapters for
context-specific empathy that specialize in varying empathy levels based on the
recognized task. Our empirical results demonstrate a significant gap reduction
of 72.66% between perceived and desired empathy with scores increasing by an
average factor of 2.43 as measured by our metrics and reward models.
Additionally, our trained empathetic expert adapters demonstrate superior
effectiveness in preserving empathy patterns throughout conversation turns,
outperforming system prompts, which tend to dramatically diminish in impact as
conversations lengthen.

Conclusion: ABC算法通过智能路径规划实现高效红队评估，大幅降低测试开销，为LLM安全防护提供新方法论

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely deployed across various
applications, yet their potential security and ethical risks have raised
increasing concerns. Existing research employs red teaming evaluations,
utilizing multi-turn jailbreaks to identify potential vulnerabilities in LLMs.
However, these approaches often lack exploration of successful dialogue
trajectories within the attack space, and they tend to overlook the
considerable overhead associated with the attack process. To address these
limitations, this paper first introduces a theoretical model based on
dynamically weighted graph topology, abstracting the multi-turn attack process
as a path planning problem. Based on this framework, we propose ABC, an
enhanced Artificial Bee Colony algorithm for multi-turn jailbreaks, featuring a
collaborative search mechanism with employed, onlooker, and scout bees. This
algorithm significantly improves the efficiency of optimal attack path search
while substantially reducing the average number of queries required. Empirical
evaluations on three open-source and two proprietary language models
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving attack success rates
above 90\% across the board, with a peak of 98\% on GPT-3.5-Turbo, and
outperforming existing baselines. Furthermore, it achieves comparable success
with only 26 queries on average, significantly reducing red teaming overhead
and highlighting its superior efficiency.

Conclusion: 建议优先研究LLM底层架构内嵌式水印技术，需建立跨学科评估框架应对技术-法律协同挑战

Abstract: To foster trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI) within the European Union,
the AI Act requires providers to mark and detect the outputs of their
general-purpose models. The Article 50 and Recital 133 call for marking methods
that are ''sufficiently reliable, interoperable, effective and robust''. Yet,
the rapidly evolving and heterogeneous landscape of watermarks for Large
Language Models (LLMs) makes it difficult to determine how these four standards
can be translated into concrete and measurable evaluations. Our paper addresses
this challenge, anchoring the normativity of European requirements in the
multiplicity of watermarking techniques. Introducing clear and distinct
concepts on LLM watermarking, our contribution is threefold. (1) Watermarking
Categorisation: We propose an accessible taxonomy of watermarking methods
according to the stage of the LLM lifecycle at which they are applied - before,
during, or after training, and during next-token distribution or sampling. (2)
Watermarking Evaluation: We interpret the EU AI Act's requirements by mapping
each criterion with state-of-the-art evaluations on robustness and
detectability of the watermark, and of quality of the LLM. Since
interoperability remains largely untheorised in LLM watermarking research, we
propose three normative dimensions to frame its assessment. (3) Watermarking
Comparison: We compare current watermarking methods for LLMs against the
operationalised European criteria and show that no approach yet satisfies all
four standards. Encouraged by emerging empirical tests, we recommend further
research into watermarking directly embedded within the low-level architecture
of LLMs.

Motivation: 传统FFT海洋无法表达局部非均匀波浪交互，而波粒子方法在大规模场景中计算成本过高且难以匹配全局频谱统计。需要兼顾全局真实感与局部交互性。

Method: 1. 混合表示框架：通过统一频谱参数驱动全局FFT背景与局部波粒子区域

Conclusion: 该创新框架突破传统方法局限，通过频谱一致性设计成功融合全局/局部模拟优势，为实时交互式海洋仿真提供新范式。

Abstract: Fast Fourier Transform-based (FFT) spectral oceans are widely adopted for
their efficiency and large-scale realism, but they assume global stationarity
and spatial homogeneity, making it difficult to represent non-uniform seas and
near-field interactions (e.g., ships and floaters). In contrast, wave particles
capture local wakes and ripples, yet are costly to maintain at scale and hard
to match global spectral statistics.We present a real-time interactive hybrid
ocean: a global FFT background coupled with local wave-particle (WP) patch
regions around interactive objects, jointly driven under a unified set of
spectral parameters and dispersion. At patch boundaries, particles are injected
according to the same directional spectrum as the FFT, aligning the local
frequency-direction distribution with the background and matching energy
density, without disturbing the far field.Our approach introduces two main
innovations: (1) Hybrid ocean representation. We couple a global FFT background
with local WP patches under a unified spectrum, achieving large-scale spectral
consistency while supporting localized wakes and ripples.(2) Frequency-bucketed
implementation. We design a particle sampling and GPU-parallel synthesis scheme
based on frequency buckets, which preserves spectral energy consistency and
sustains real-time interactive performance.Together, these innovations enable a
unified framework that delivers both large-scale spectral realism and
fine-grained interactivity in real time.

Conclusion: 构建动态决策基准必要性凸显，需测试模型在持续不确定性下的序列决策一致性与实时适应能力

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across
benchmarks--from knowledge quizzes and math reasoning to web-agent tasks--but
these tests occur in static settings, lacking real dynamics and uncertainty.
Consequently, they evaluate isolated reasoning or problem-solving rather than
decision-making under uncertainty. To address this, we introduce
LiveTradeBench, a live trading environment for evaluating LLM agents in
realistic and evolving markets. LiveTradeBench follows three design principles:
(i) Live data streaming of market prices and news, eliminating dependence on
offline backtesting and preventing information leakage while capturing
real-time uncertainty; (ii) a portfolio-management abstraction that extends
control from single-asset actions to multi-asset allocation, integrating risk
management and cross-asset reasoning; and (iii) multi-market evaluation across
structurally distinct environments--U.S. stocks and Polymarket prediction
markets--differing in volatility, liquidity, and information flow. At each
step, an agent observes prices, news, and its portfolio, then outputs
percentage allocations that balance risk and return. Using LiveTradeBench, we
run 50-day live evaluations of 21 LLMs across families. Results show that (1)
high LMArena scores do not imply superior trading outcomes; (2) models display
distinct portfolio styles reflecting risk appetite and reasoning dynamics; and
(3) some LLMs effectively leverage live signals to adapt decisions. These
findings expose a gap between static evaluation and real-world competence,
motivating benchmarks that test sequential decision making and consistency
under live uncertainty.
