To test whether\nAI-generated ideas lead to better research outcomes, we conduct an execution\nstudy by recruiting 43 expert researchers to execute randomly-assigned ideas,\neither written by experts or generated by an LLM. Each expert spent over 100\nhours implementing the idea and wrote a 4-page short paper to document the\nexperiments. All the executed projects are then reviewed blindly by expert NLP\nresearchers. Comparing the review scores of the same ideas before and after\nexecution, the scores of the LLM-generated ideas decrease significantly more\nthan expert-written ideas on all evaluation metrics (novelty, excitement,\neffectiveness, and overall; p < 0.05), closing the gap between LLM and human\nideas observed at the ideation stage.

Given a\nsingle character sketch, we first employ an MLLM to generate a structured\nstoryboard with shot-level descriptions that specify environment settings,\ncharacter actions, and camera perspectives. To ensure visual consistency, we\nintroduce a style propagation adapter that captures the character's visual\nstyle and applies it to the background, faithfully retaining the character's\nfull visual identity while synthesizing style-consistent scenes. A shot design\nmodule further enhances visual diversity and cinematic quality through frame\ncropping and multi-view synthesis based on the storyboard. To animate the\nstory, we reconstruct a 3D proxy of the character to derive physically\nplausible motion sequences, which are then used to fine-tune an MMDiT-based\nimage-to-video diffusion model. We further propose a two-stage motion\ncustomization adapter: the first stage learns appearance features from\ntemporally unordered frames, disentangling identity from motion; the second\nstage models temporal dynamics using a timestep-shift strategy with frozen\nidentity weights. Once trained, FairyGen directly renders diverse and coherent\nvideo scenes aligned with the storyboard.

There is also a growing expectation for them\nto display human-like personalities during interactions. To meet this\nexpectation, numerous studies have proposed methods for modelling LLM\npersonalities through psychometric evaluations. However, most existing models\nface two major limitations: they rely on the Big Five (OCEAN) framework, which\nonly provides coarse personality dimensions, and they lack mechanisms for\ncontrolling trait intensity. In this paper, we address this gap by extending\nthe Machine Personality Inventory (MPI), which originally used the Big Five\nmodel, to incorporate the 16 Personality Factor (16PF) model, allowing\nexpressive control over sixteen distinct traits. We also developed a structured\nframework known as Specific Attribute Control (SAC) for evaluating and\ndynamically inducing trait intensity in LLMs. Our method introduces\nadjective-based semantic anchoring to guide trait intensity expression and\nleverages behavioural questions across five intensity factors:\n\\textit{Frequency}, \\textit{Depth}, \\textit{Threshold}, \\textit{Effort}, and\n\\textit{Willingness}. Through experimentation, we find that modelling intensity\nas a continuous spectrum yields substantially more consistent and controllable\npersonality expression compared to binary trait toggling. Moreover, we observe\nthat changes in target trait intensity systematically influence closely related\ntraits in psychologically coherent directions, suggesting that LLMs internalize\nmulti-dimensional personality structures rather than treating traits in\nisolation.

Since SAEs are trained post-hoc, it is unclear if the\nfailure to discover a particular concept is a failure on the SAE's side or due\nto the underlying LM not representing this concept. This problem is exacerbated\nby training conditions and architecture choices affecting which features an SAE\nlearns. When tracing how LMs learn concepts during training, the lack of\nfeature stability also makes it difficult to compare SAEs features across\ndifferent checkpoints. To address these limitations, we introduce a\nmodification to the transformer architecture that incorporates a TopK\nactivation function at chosen layers, making the model's hidden states\nequivalent to the latent features of a TopK SAE. This approach eliminates the\nneed for post-hoc training while providing interpretability comparable to SAEs.\nThe resulting TopK LMs offer a favorable trade-off between model size,\ncomputational efficiency, and interpretability.

Our experiments demonstrate that\nthe sparse representations learned by TopK LMs enable successful steering\nthrough targeted neuron interventions and facilitate detailed analysis of\nneuron formation processes across checkpoints and layers. These features make\nTopK LMs stable and reliable tools for understanding how language models learn\nand represent concepts, which we believe will significantly advance future\nresearch on model interpretability and controllability."}

Additionally, we analyze\ncomputational resource requirements across different adapter scales,\ndemonstrating how mid-sized adapters (40M parameters) achieve an optimal\nbalance between expressivity and quality. Furthermore, we find that Mustango, a\ndiffusion-based model, generates more diverse outputs with better adherence to\nthe description in the input prompt while lacking in providing stability in\nnotes, rhythm alignment, and aesthetics. Also, it is computationally intensive\nand requires significantly more time to train. In contrast, autoregressive\nmodels like MusicGen offer faster training and are more efficient, and can\nproduce better quality output in comparison, but have slightly higher\nredundancy in their generations."}

This research\ninvestigates hybrid modeling strategies that integrate classical signal\nprocessing techniques with deep learning architectures to address this problem\nin low-resource scenarios. Two hybrid models were developed and evaluated: (1)\nMel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) combined with a Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (CNN), and (2) Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) features combined with\na Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The models were trained on a dialect-filtered\nsubset of the Common Voice Arabic dataset, with dialect labels assigned based\non speaker metadata. Experimental results demonstrate that the MFCC + CNN\narchitecture achieved superior performance, with an accuracy of 91.2% and\nstrong precision, recall, and F1-scores, significantly outperforming the\nWavelet + RNN configuration, which achieved an accuracy of 66.5%. These\nfindings highlight the effectiveness of leveraging spectral features with\nconvolutional models for Arabic dialect recognition, especially when working\nwith limited labeled data. The study also identifies limitations related to\ndataset size, potential regional overlaps in labeling, and model optimization,\nproviding a roadmap for future research. Recommendations for further\nimprovement include the adoption of larger annotated corpora, integration of\nself-supervised learning techniques, and exploration of advanced neural\narchitectures such as Transformers. Overall, this research establishes a strong\nbaseline for future developments in Arabic dialect recognition within\nresource-constrained environments."}

Prior work has made\nBayesian deep learning-based approaches to this problem more tractable by\nperforming inference over the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) parameters of a\nfine-tuned model. While effective, these approaches struggle to scale to larger\nLLMs due to requiring further additional parameters compared to LoRA.

We perform\nBayesian inference in an $r$-dimensional subspace, for LoRA rank $r$. By\nrepurposing the LoRA parameters as projection matrices, we are able to map\nsamples from this subspace into the full weight space of the LLM.

The significant improvement comes from a synergistic\napproach, \"map-then-reason\", that jointly trains the model to first generate a\ncognitive map and then reason upon it. By training models to reason over these\ninternal maps, we boosted accuracy from 37.8% to 60.8% (+23.0%). Adding\nreinforcement learning pushed performance even further to 70.7% (+32.9%).

In response, we introduce\nHalluSegBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate\nhallucinations in visual grounding through the lens of counterfactual visual\nreasoning. Our benchmark consists of a novel dataset of 1340 counterfactual\ninstance pairs spanning 281 unique object classes, and a set of newly\nintroduced metrics that quantify hallucination sensitivity under visually\ncoherent scene edits. Experiments on HalluSegBench with state-of-the-art\nvision-language segmentation models reveal that vision-driven hallucinations\nare significantly more prevalent than label-driven ones, with models often\npersisting in false segmentation, highlighting the need for counterfactual\nreasoning to diagnose grounding fidelity."}
