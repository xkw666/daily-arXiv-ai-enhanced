However, their effectiveness diminishes significantly\nin the contexts of low-resource languages. Current multilingual enhancement\nmethods are often limited to text modality or rely solely on machine\ntranslation. While such approaches help models acquire basic linguistic\ncapabilities and produce \"thin descriptions\", they neglect the importance of\nmultimodal informativeness and cultural groundedness, both of which are crucial\nfor serving low-resource language users effectively. To bridge this gap, in\nthis study, we identify two significant objectives for a truly effective MLLM\nin low-resource language settings, namely 1) linguistic capability and 2)\ncultural groundedness, placing special emphasis on cultural awareness. To\nachieve these dual objectives, we propose a dual-source strategy that guides\nthe collection of data tailored to each goal, sourcing native web alt-text for\nculture and MLLM-generated captions for linguistics. As a concrete\nimplementation, we introduce MELLA, a multimodal, multilingual dataset.\nExperiment results show that after fine-tuning on MELLA, there is a general\nperformance improvement for the eight languages on various MLLM backbones, with\nmodels producing \"thick descriptions\". We verify that the performance gains are\nfrom both cultural knowledge enhancement and linguistic capability enhancement.\nOur dataset can be found at https://opendatalab.com/applyMultilingualCorpus."}

To handle diverse, task-directed dialog, and find\nsuccessful collaborative strategies that minimize human effort, MICoBot makes\ndecisions at three levels: (1) a meta-planner considers human dialog to\nformulate and code a high-level collaboration strategy, (2) a planner optimally\nallocates the remaining steps to either agent based on the robot's capabilities\n(measured by a simulation-pretrained affordance model) and the human's\nestimated availability to help, and (3) an action executor decides the\nlow-level actions to perform or words to say to the human.

All current QAT\nresearch focuses on minimizing quantization error on full-precision models,\nwhere the full-precision accuracy acts as an upper bound (accuracy ceiling). No\nexisting method has even attempted to surpass this ceiling. To break this\nceiling, we propose a new paradigm: raising the ceiling (full-precision model),\nand then still quantizing it efficiently into 2 bits.

However, extending CoT to vision-language reasoning tasks remains\nchallenging, as it often requires interpreting transitions of visual states to\nsupport reasoning. Existing methods often struggle with this due to limited\ncapacity of modeling visual state transitions or incoherent visual trajectories\ncaused by fragmented architectures.\n  To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-CoT, a Unified Chain-of-Thought\nframework that enables coherent and grounded multimodal reasoning within a\nsingle unified model. The key idea is to leverage a model capable of both image\nunderstanding and generation to reason over visual content and model evolving\nvisual states. However, empowering a unified model to achieve that is\nnon-trivial, given the high computational cost and the burden of training. To\naddress this, Uni-CoT introduces a novel two-level reasoning paradigm: A\nMacro-Level CoT for high-level task planning and A Micro-Level CoT for subtask\nexecution. This design significantly reduces the computational overhead.\nFurthermore, we introduce a structured training paradigm that combines\ninterleaved image-text supervision for macro-level CoT with multi-task\nobjectives for micro-level CoT. Together, these innovations allow Uni-CoT to\nperform scalable and coherent multi-modal reasoning. Furthermore, thanks to our\ndesign, all experiments can be efficiently completed using only 8 A100 GPUs\nwith 80GB VRAM each. Experimental results on reasoning-driven image generation\nbenchmark (WISE) and editing benchmarks (RISE and KRIS) indicates that Uni-CoT\ndemonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalization, establishing Uni-CoT\nas a promising solution for multi-modal reasoning.

While existing methods achieve strong performance\nthrough extensive supervised training or reinforcement learning with labeled\nrewards, they remain constrained by the cost and availability of pixel-level\nannotations. We observe that when models generate multiple predictions for the\nsame GUI element, the spatial overlap patterns reveal implicit confidence\nsignals that can guide more accurate localization. Leveraging this insight, we\npropose GUI-RC (Region Consistency), a test-time scaling method that constructs\nspatial voting grids from multiple sampled predictions to identify consensus\nregions where models show highest agreement. Without any training, GUI-RC\nimproves accuracy by 2-3% across various architectures on ScreenSpot\nbenchmarks.
