While\nthe LAMB optimizer partially addresses this issue, some attention layers still\nface this issue. The reason is that $l_2$-norm-based trust ratios in LAMB are\nless effective in directly influencing the max value of query/key weights.\nFurthermore, the weight-wise trust ratio in LAMB is error-prone as it overlooks\nrelationships of weight values within rows or columns.
