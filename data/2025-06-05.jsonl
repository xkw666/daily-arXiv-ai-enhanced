In\ncontrast to previous approaches, our method does not require cross-modal camera\ncalibration and is versatile enough to model a variety of different spectra,\nincluding thermal and near-infra red, without any algorithmic changes.\n  Unlike existing 3DGS-based frameworks that treat each modality separately (by\noptimizing per-channel spherical harmonics) and therefore fail to exploit the\nunderlying spectral and spatial correlations, our method leverages a novel\nneural color representation that encodes multi-spectral information into a\nlearned, compact, per-splat feature embedding. A shallow multi-layer perceptron\n(MLP) then decodes this embedding to obtain spectral color values, enabling\njoint learning of all bands within a unified representation.\n  Our experiments show that this simple yet effective strategy is able to\nimprove multi-spectral rendering quality, while also leading to improved\nper-spectra rendering quality over state-of-the-art methods.

However, their deployment is resource-intensive, not\nonly due to the large number of model parameters but also because the\n(Key-Value) KV cache consumes a lot of memory during inference. While several\nworks propose reducing the KV cache by evicting the unnecessary tokens, these\napproaches rely on accumulated attention score as eviction score to quantify\nthe importance of the token. We identify the accumulated attention score is\nbiased and it decreases with the position of the tokens in the mathematical\nexpectation. As a result, the retained tokens concentrate on the initial\npositions, limiting model's access to global contextual information. To address\nthis issue, we propose Adaptive holistic attention KV (AhaKV), it addresses the\nbias of the accumulated attention score by adaptively tuning the scale of\nsoftmax according the expectation of information entropy of attention scores.\nTo make use of the holistic attention information in self-attention mechanism,\nAhaKV utilize the information of value vectors, which is overlooked in previous\nworks, to refine the adaptive score.

Finally, we show that including demographic\nidentity terms (e.g., ``a woman'', ``a Black person'') in input scenarios\namplifies directional drift, despite identical underlying quantities,\nhighlighting the interplay between semantic framing and social referents. These\nfindings expose critical blind spots in standard evaluation and motivate\nframing-aware benchmarks for diagnosing reasoning robustness and fairness in\nLLMs."}

To address these challenges, task\nvector-based approaches compress task information into a single vector.\nHowever, these methods typically construct task vectors from fixed sets of\ndemonstrations and reuse them across input queries, without conditioning on the\nspecific input.

In this\npaper, we propose Entity-centric Multimodal Preference Optimization (EMPO),\nwhich achieves enhanced modality alignment than existing human preference\nalignment methods. Besides, to overcome the scarcity of high-quality multimodal\npreference data, we utilize open-source instruction datasets to automatically\nconstruct high-quality preference data across three aspects: image,\ninstruction, and response. Experiments on two human preference datasets and\nfive multimodal hallucination benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of EMPO,\ne.g., reducing hallucination rates by 85.9% on Object-HalBench and 49.8% on\nMM-HalBench."}

While recent advances have leveraged large\nlanguage models (LLMs) for reasoning over structured tables, such high-quality\ntextual representations are often unavailable in real-world settings, where\ntables typically appear as images. In this paper, we tackle the task of tabular\nreasoning from table images, leveraging privileged structured information\navailable during training to enhance multimodal large language models (MLLMs).\nThe key challenges lie in the complexity of accurately aligning structured\ninformation with visual representations, and in effectively transferring\nstructured reasoning skills to MLLMs despite the input modality gap.

A Benchmark for Multimodal Deep Reasoning in Videos", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.CL"], "comment": "Project Page: https://mmr-v.github.io", "summary": "The sequential structure of videos poses a challenge to the ability of\nmultimodal large language models (MLLMs) to locate multi-frame evidence and\nconduct multimodal reasoning. However, existing video benchmarks mainly focus\non understanding tasks, which only require models to match frames mentioned in\nthe question (hereafter referred to as \"question frame\") and perceive a few\nadjacent frames. To address this gap, we propose MMR-V: A Benchmark for\nMultimodal Deep Reasoning in Videos. The benchmark is characterized by the\nfollowing features. (1) Long-range, multi-frame reasoning: Models are required\nto infer and analyze evidence frames that may be far from the question frame.\n(2) Beyond perception: Questions cannot be answered through direct perception\nalone but require reasoning over hidden information. (3) Reliability: All tasks\nare manually annotated, referencing extensive real-world user understanding to\nalign with common perceptions. (4) Confusability: Carefully designed distractor\nannotation strategies to reduce model shortcuts. MMR-V consists of 317 videos\nand 1,257 tasks. Our experiments reveal that current models still struggle with\nmulti-modal reasoning; even the best-performing model, o4-mini, achieves only\n52.5% accuracy. Additionally, current reasoning enhancement strategies\n(Chain-of-Thought and scaling test-time compute) bring limited gains. Further\nanalysis indicates that the CoT demanded for multi-modal reasoning differs from\nit in textual reasoning, which partly explains the limited performance gains.\nWe hope that MMR-V can inspire further research into enhancing multi-modal\nreasoning capabilities."}

However, they still struggle to activate complex reasoning. In\nthis paper, rather than examining multimodal RL in isolation, we delve into\ncurrent training pipelines and identify three crucial phenomena: 1) Effective\ncold start initialization is critical for enhancing MLLM reasoning.\nIntriguingly, we find that initializing with carefully selected text data alone\ncan lead to performance surpassing many recent multimodal reasoning models,\neven before multimodal RL. 2) Standard GRPO applied to multimodal RL suffers\nfrom gradient stagnation, which degrades training stability and performance. 3)\nSubsequent text-only RL training, following the multimodal RL phase, further\nenhances multimodal reasoning. This staged training approach effectively\nbalances perceptual grounding and cognitive reasoning development.

Understanding Test-Time Scaling in Reasoning Models", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "comment": null, "summary": "Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1,\nDeepSeek R1) have led to a popular belief that extending thinking traces using\nprompts like \"Wait\" or \"Let me rethink\" can improve performance. This raises a\nnatural question: Does thinking more at test-time truly lead to better\nreasoning? To answer this question, we perform a detailed empirical study\nacross models and benchmarks, which reveals a consistent pattern of initial\nperformance improvements from additional thinking followed by a decline, due to\n\"overthinking\". To understand this non-monotonic trend, we consider a simple\nprobabilistic model, which reveals that additional thinking increases output\nvariance-creating an illusion of improved reasoning while ultimately\nundermining precision. Thus, observed gains from \"more thinking\" are not true\nindicators of improved reasoning, but artifacts stemming from the connection\nbetween model uncertainty and evaluation metric. This suggests that test-time\nscaling through extended thinking is not an effective way to utilize the\ninference thinking budget. Recognizing these limitations, we introduce an\nalternative test-time scaling approach, parallel thinking, inspired by\nBest-of-N sampling. Our method generates multiple independent reasoning paths\nwithin the same inference budget and selects the most consistent response via\nmajority vote, achieving up to 20% higher accuracy compared to extended\nthinking. This provides a simple yet effective mechanism for test-time scaling\nof reasoning models."}
