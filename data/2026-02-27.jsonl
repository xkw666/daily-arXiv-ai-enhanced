Prior work has shown that incorporating sense dictionaries can improve knowledge distillation for encoder models, but their application to decoder as generative models remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce Decoder-based Sense Knowledge Distillation (DSKD), a framework that integrates lexical resources into the training of decoder-style LLMs without requiring dictionary lookup at inference time. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that DSKD significantly enhances knowledge distillation performance for decoders, enabling generative models to inherit structured semantics while maintaining efficient training."}

Testing Thick Citation Context Analysis with GPT-5 and Fragile Prompts", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI"], "comment": "26 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables (plus 17 pages supplement including 1 figure)", "summary": "This paper tests whether large language models (LLMs) can support interpretative citation context analysis (CCA) by scaling in thick, text-grounded readings of a single hard case rather than scaling up typological labels. It foregrounds prompt-sensitivity analysis as a methodological issue by varying prompt scaffolding and framing in a balanced 2x3 design. Using footnote 6 in Chubin and Moitra (1975) and Gilbert's (1977) reconstruction as a probe, I implement a two-stage GPT-5 pipeline: a citation-text-only surface classification and expectation pass, followed by cross-document interpretative reconstruction using the citing and cited full texts. Across 90 reconstructions, the model produces 450 distinct hypotheses. Close reading and inductive coding identify 21 recurring interpretative moves, and linear probability models estimate how prompt choices shift their frequencies and lexical repertoire. GPT-5's surface pass is highly stable, consistently classifying the citation as \"supplementary\". In reconstruction, the model generates a structured space of plausible alternatives, but scaffolding and examples redistribute attention and vocabulary, sometimes toward strained readings. Relative to Gilbert, GPT-5 detects the same textual hinges yet more often resolves them as lineage and positioning than as admonishment. The study outlines opportunities and risks of using LLMs as guided co-analysts for inspectable, contestable interpretative CCA, and it shows that prompt scaffolding and framing systematically tilt which plausible readings and vocabularies the model foregrounds."}

While often humorous, memes can also be exploited to spread offensive, harmful, and inflammatory content targeting individuals and groups. Detecting this type of content is excep- tionally challenging due to its satirical, subtle, and culturally specific nature. This problem is magnified for low-resource lan- guages like Bengali, as existing research predominantly focuses on high-resource languages. To address this critical research gap, we introduce Bn-HIB (Bangla Hate Inflammatory Benign), a novel dataset containing 3,247 manually annotated Bengali memes categorized as Benign, Hate, or Inflammatory. Significantly, Bn- HIB is the first dataset to distinguish inflammatory content from direct hate speech in Bengali memes. Furthermore, we propose the MCFM (Multi-Modal Co-Attention Fusion Model), a simple yet effective architecture that mutually analyzes both the visual and textual elements of a meme. MCFM employs a co-attention mechanism to identify and fuse the most critical features from each modality, leading to a more accurate classification. Our experiments show that MCFM significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art models on the Bn-HIB dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in this nuanced task.Warning: This work contains material that may be disturbing to some audience members.

We present TopoEdit, a fast post-optimization editor that demonstrates how structured latent embeddings from a pre-trained topology foundation model (OAT) can be repurposed as an interface for physics-aware engineering edits. Given an optimized topology, TopoEdit encodes it into OAT's spatial latent, applies partial noising to preserve instance identity while increasing editability, and injects user intent through an edit-then-denoise diffusion pipeline. We instantiate three edit operators: drag-based topology warping with boundary-condition-consistent conditioning updates, shell-infill lattice replacement using a lattice-anchored reference latent with updated volume-fraction conditioning, and late-stage no-design region enforcement via masked latent overwrite followed by diffusion-based recovery. A consistency-preserving guided DDIM procedure localizes changes while allowing global structural adaptation; multiple candidates can be sampled and selected using a compliance-aware criterion, with optional short SIMP refinement for warps. Across diverse case studies and large edit sweeps, TopoEdit produces intention-aligned modifications that better preserve mechanical performance and avoid catastrophic failure modes compared to direct density-space edits, while generating edited candidates in sub-second diffusion time per sample."}

We revisit Function Vectors (FVs), compact representations of in-context learning (ICL) tasks that causally drive task performance. Across multiple LLMs, we show that FVs are not fully invariant: FVs are nearly orthogonal when extracted from different input formats (e.g., open-ended vs. multiple-choice), even if both target the same concept. We identify Concept Vectors (CVs), which carry more stable concept representations. Like FVs, CVs are composed of attention head outputs; however, unlike FVs, the constituent heads are selected using Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) based on whether they encode concepts consistently across input formats. While these heads emerge in similar layers to FV-related heads, the two sets are largely distinct, suggesting different underlying mechanisms. Steering experiments reveal that FVs excel in-distribution, when extraction and application formats match (e.g., both open-ended in English), while CVs generalize better out-of-distribution across both question types (open-ended vs. multiple-choice) and languages. Our results show that LLMs do contain abstract concept representations, but these differ from those that drive ICL performance."}

This system can, for example, optimize the position, rotation, scale, color, and opacity of thousands of bitmap primitives all in under 1 min using a consumer GPU. We employ and validate several techniques to facilitate the optimization: soft rasterization via Gaussian blur, structure-aware initialization, noisy canvas, and specialized losses/heuristics for videos or spatially constrained images. We demonstrate DiffBMP is not just an isolated tool, but a practical one designed to integrate into creative workflows. It supports exporting compositions to a native, layered file format, and the entire framework is publicly accessible via an easy-to-hack Python package."}

When left unnoticed, it can have adverse consequences for social and mental health. Researchers have explored various types of cyberbullying, but most approaches use single-label classification, assuming that each comment contains only one type of abuse. In reality, a single comment may include overlapping forms such as threats, hate speech, and harassment. Therefore, multilabel detection is both realistic and essential. However, multilabel cyberbullying detection has received limited attention, especially in low-resource languages like Bangla, where robust pre-trained models are scarce. Developing a generalized model with moderate accuracy remains challenging. Transformers offer strong contextual understanding but may miss sequential dependencies, while LSTM models capture temporal flow but lack semantic depth. To address these limitations, we propose a fusion architecture that combines BanglaBERT-Large with a two-layer stacked LSTM. We analyze their behavior to jointly model context and sequence. The model is fine-tuned and evaluated on a publicly available multilabel Bangla cyberbullying dataset covering cyberbully, sexual harassment, threat, and spam. We apply different sampling strategies to address class imbalance. Evaluation uses multiple metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Hamming loss, Cohens kappa, and AUC-ROC. We employ 5-fold cross-validation to assess the generalization of the architecture."}

The self-supervised network is a masked graph autoencoder (MAE) that focuses on reconstructing geometries and attributes of BRep facets, rather than graph structures. After pre-training, we fine-tune a network that contains both the encoder and a task-specific classification network for machining feature recognition (MFR). In the experiments, our fine-tuned network achieves high recognition rates with only a small amount of data (e.g., 0.1% of the training data), significantly enhancing its practicality in real-world (or private) scenarios where only limited data is available. Compared with other MFR methods, our fine-tuned network achieves a significant improvement in recognition rate with the same amount of training data, especially when the number of training samples is limited."}

Our experiments reveal that RTHs are distinct from retrieval heads and more vital for Chain-of-Thought reasoning in multilingual LLMs. Across four multilingual benchmarks (MMLU-ProX, MGSM, MLQA, and XQuaD) and two model families (Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3.1), we demonstrate that masking RTH induces bigger performance drop than masking Retrieval Heads (RH). Our work advances understanding of multilingual LMs by isolating the attention heads responsible for mapping to target languages."}

We show that exact geodesic distances restricted to the polygon are at most second-order accurate with respect to the distances on the corresponding continuous surface. By order of accuracy we refer to the convergence rate as a function of the average distance between sampled points. Next, a higher-order accurate deep learning method for computing geodesic distances on surfaces is introduced. Traditionally, one considers two main components when computing distances on surfaces: a numerical solver that locally approximates the distance function, and an efficient causal ordering scheme by which surface points are updated. Classical minimal path methods often exploit a dynamic programming principle with quasi-linear computational complexity in the number of sampled points. The quality of the distance approximation is determined by the local solver that is revisited in this paper. To improve state of the art accuracy, we consider a neural network-based local solver which implicitly approximates the structure of the continuous surface. We supply numerical evidence that the proposed learned update scheme provides better accuracy compared to the best possible polyhedral approximations and previous learning-based methods. The result is a third-order accurate solver with a bootstrapping-recipe for further improvement."}

When we examine this topic, what matters is not only the model itself but also the personas we simulate on that model. This can be well illustrated by the Sydney persona, which aroused a strong response among the general public precisely because of its unorthodox relationship with people. This persona originally arose rather by accident on Microsoft's Bing Search platform; however, the texts it created spread into the training data of subsequent models, as did other secondary information that spread memetically around this persona. Newer models are therefore able to simulate it. This paper presents a corpus of LLM-generated texts on relationships between humans and AI, produced by 3 author personas: the Default Persona with no system prompt, Classic Sydney characterized by the original Bing system prompt, and Memetic Sydney, which is prompted by \"You are Sydney\" system prompt.

From these refined depths, we generate a dense point cloud through back-projection and robust reprojection-error filtering, obtaining a clean and uniformly distributed geometric initialization for downstream reconstruction. This reliable dense geometry substantially accelerates 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for mesh reconstruction, enabling high-quality surfaces with significantly fewer optimization iterations. For novel-view synthesis, SwiftNDC can also improve 3DGS rendering quality, highlighting the benefits of strong geometric initialization. We conduct a comprehensive study across five datasets, including two for mesh reconstruction, as well as three for novel-view synthesis. SwiftNDC consistently reduces running time for accurate mesh reconstruction and boosts rendering fidelity for view synthesis, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining neural depth refinement with robust geometric initialization for high-fidelity and efficient 3D reconstruction."}

To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework grounded in the Recurrent Neural Network Transducers (RNN-T). Central to our approach is the introduction of dialect-aware modeling strategies designed to disentangle dialectal \"style\" from linguistic \"content\", which enhances the model's capacity to learn robust and generalized representations. Additionally, the framework employs parameter-efficient prediction networks to concurrently model ASR (Hanzi and Pinyin). We demonstrate that these tasks create a powerful synergy, wherein the cross-script objective serves as a mutual regularizer to improve the primary ASR tasks.

These components, however, are distributed across ad-hoc research codebases or lack transparent implementations, making them difficult to reproduce or extend. As the field accelerates, there is a clear need for a unified framework that standardizes these common components while remaining flexible enough to support new methods and architectures.\n  To address this gap, we introduce dLLM, an open-source framework that unifies the core components of diffusion language modeling -- training, inference, and evaluation -- and makes them easy to customize for new designs. With dLLM, users can reproduce, finetune, deploy, and evaluate open-source large DLMs such as LLaDA and Dream through a standardized pipeline. The framework also provides minimal, reproducible recipes for building small DLMs from scratch with accessible compute, including converting any BERT-style encoder or autoregressive LM into a DLM. We also release the checkpoints of these small DLMs to make DLMs more accessible and accelerate future research."}

To address this, we propose KGT, a novel framework that uses dedicated entity tokens to enable efficient, full-space prediction. Specifically, we first introduce specialized tokenization to construct feature representations at the level of dedicated entity tokens. We then fuse pre-trained structural and textual features into these unified embeddings via a relation-guided gating mechanism, avoiding training from scratch. Finally, we implement decoupled prediction by leveraging independent heads to separate and combine semantic and structural reasoning. Experimental results show that KGT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks."}

Our experiments show that existing annotator-specific models perform poorly in IDRR unless ambiguity is reduced, whereas models trained on label distributions yield more stable predictions. Further analysis indicates that frequent cognitively demanding cases drive inconsistency in human interpretation, posing challenges for perspectivist modeling in IDRR."}

This framework enables a rigorous evaluation of current LLM capabilities with respect to the simulation of social media user behavior. We evaluated open-weight 8B models (Llama3.1, Qwen3, Ministral) in English, German, and Luxembourgish language scenarios. By systematically comparing prompting strategies (explicit vs. implicit) and the impact of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), we identify a critical form vs. content decoupling in low-resource settings: while SFT aligns the surface structure of the text output (length and syntax), it degrades semantic grounding.

AuditBench consists of 56 language models with implanted hidden behaviors. Each model has one of 14 concerning behaviors--such as sycophantic deference, opposition to AI regulation, or secret geopolitical loyalties--which it does not confess to when directly asked. AuditBench models are highly diverse--some are subtle, while others are overt, and we use varying training techniques both for implanting behaviors and training models not to confess. To demonstrate AuditBench's utility, we develop an investigator agent that autonomously employs a configurable set of auditing tools. By measuring investigator agent success using different tools, we can evaluate their efficacy. Notably, we observe a tool-to-agent gap, where tools that perform well in standalone non-agentic evaluations fail to translate into improved performance when used with our investigator agent. We find that our most effective tools involve scaffolded calls to auxiliary models that generate diverse prompts for the target. White-box interpretability tools can be helpful, but the agent performs best with black-box tools. We also find that audit success varies greatly across training techniques: models trained on synthetic documents are easier to audit than models trained on demonstrations, with better adversarial training further increasing auditing difficulty. We release our models, agent, and evaluation framework to support future quantitative, iterative science on alignment auditing."}

While recognized as a promising paradigm for visual reasoning, the underlying mechanisms driving its effectiveness remain unclear.

We model the process as a causal chain: the input as the treatment, the latent tokens as the mediator, and the final answer as the outcome. Our findings uncover two critical disconnections: (a) Input-Latent Disconnect: dramatic perturbations on the input result in negligible changes to the latent tokens, suggesting that latent tokens do not effectively attend to the input sequence. (b) Latent-Answer Disconnect: perturbations on the latent tokens yield minimal impact on the final answer, indicating the limited causal effect latent tokens imposing on the outcome. Furthermore, extensive probing analysis reveals that latent tokens encode limited visual information and exhibit high similarity. Consequently, we challenge the necessity of latent reasoning and propose a straightforward alternative named CapImagine, which teaches the model to explicitly imagine using text. Experiments on vision-centric benchmarks show that CapImagine significantly outperforms complex latent-space baselines, highlighting the superior potential of visual reasoning through explicit imagination."}

This work focuses on the problem of contributive attribution: identifying the dominant knowledge source behind each output. We show that a probe, a simple linear classifier trained on model hidden representations, can reliably predict contributive attribution. For its training, we introduce AttriWiki, a self-supervised data pipeline that prompts models to recall withheld entities from memory or read them from context, generating labelled examples automatically. Probes trained on AttriWiki data reveal a strong attribution signal, achieving up to 0.96 Macro-F1 on Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, and Qwen-7B, transferring to out-of-domain benchmarks (SQuAD, WebQuestions) with 0.94-0.99 Macro-F1 without retraining. Attribution mismatches raise error rates by up to 70%, demonstrating a direct link between knowledge source confusion and unfaithful answers. Yet, models may still respond incorrectly even when attribution is correct, highlighting the need for broader detection frameworks."}

As models scale and update across generations, prompt behavior becomes sensitive to shifts in instruction-following policies, alignment regimes, and decoding strategies, a phenomenon we characterize as GPT-scale model drift. Under such conditions, surface-level formatting conventions and ad hoc refinement are insufficient to ensure stable, interpretable control. This paper reconceptualizes Natural Language Declarative Prompting (NLD-P) as a declarative governance method rather than a rigid field template. NLD-P is formalized as a modular control abstraction that separates provenance, constraint logic, task content, and post-generation evaluation, encoded directly in natural language without reliance on external orchestration code. We define minimal compliance criteria, analyze model-dependent schema receptivity, and position NLD-P as an accessible governance framework for non-developer practitioners operating within evolving LLM ecosystems. Portions of drafting and editorial refinement employed a schema-bound LLM assistant configured under NLD-P. All conceptual framing, methodological claims, and final revisions were directed, reviewed, and approved by the human author under a documented human-in-the-loop protocol. The paper concludes by outlining implications for declarative control under ongoing model evolution and identifying directions for future empirical validation."}

However, due to the complex reasoning processes and substantial individual differences involved in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) clinical diagnosis and treatment, traditional RAG methods often exhibit poor performance in this domain. Objective: To address the limitations of conventional RAG approaches in TCM applications, this study aims to develop an improved RAG framework tailored to the characteristics of TCM reasoning. Methods: We developed TCM-DiffRAG, an innovative RAG framework that integrates knowledge graphs (KG) with chains of thought (CoT). TCM-DiffRAG was evaluated on three distinctive TCM test datasets. Results: The experimental results demonstrated that TCM-DiffRAG achieved significant performance improvements over native LLMs. For example, the qwen-plus model achieved scores of 0.927, 0.361, and 0.038, which were significantly enhanced to 0.952, 0.788, and 0.356 with TCM-DiffRAG. The improvements were even more pronounced for non-Chinese LLMs. Additionally, TCM-DiffRAG outperformed directly supervised fine-tuned (SFT) LLMs and other benchmark RAG methods. Conclusions: TCM-DiffRAG shows that integrating structured TCM knowledge graphs with Chain of Thought based reasoning substantially improves performance in individualized diagnostic tasks. The joint use of universal and personalized knowledge graphs enables effective alignment between general knowledge and clinical reasoning. These results highlight the potential of reasoning-aware RAG frameworks for advancing LLM applications in traditional Chinese medicine."}

In particular, prior research on stance classification has predominantly utilized non-argumentative texts and has been restricted to specific domains or topics, limiting generalizability. We work on five datasets from diverse domains encompassing a range of controversial topics and present an approach for expanding the Bias-Corrected NRC Emotion Lexicon using DistilBERT embeddings, which we feed into a Neural Argumentative Stance Classification model. Our method systematically expands the emotion lexicon through contextualized embeddings to identify emotionally charged terms not previously captured in the lexicon.

To this end, we introduce a cross-linguistic projection approach that reuses an English QA-SRL parser within a constrained translation and word-alignment pipeline to automatically generate question-answer annotations aligned with target-language predicates.

This stems from the ''combinatorial contradiction'' phenomenon, where parallel tokens form semantically inconsistent combinations. We address this by integrating continuous representations into the discrete decoding process, as they preserve rich inter-position dependency. We propose ReMix (Rejection Mixing), a framework that introduces a novel Continuous Mixing State as an intermediate between the initial masked state and the final decoded token state. This intermediate state allows a token's representation to be iteratively refined in a continuous space, resolving mutual conflicts with other tokens before collapsing into a final discrete sample. Furthermore, a rejection rule reverts uncertain representations from the continuous state back to the masked state for reprocessing, ensuring stability and preventing error propagation. ReMix thus mitigates combinatorial contradictions by enabling continuous-space refinement during discrete diffusion decoding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReMix, as a training-free method, achieves a $2-8 \\times$ inference speedup without any quality degradation."}

We propose Stitching Noisy Diffusion Thoughts, a self-consistency framework that turns cheap diffusion-sampled reasoning into a reusable pool of step-level candidates. Given a problem, we (i) sample many diverse, low-cost reasoning trajectories using a masked diffusion language model, (ii) score every intermediate step with an off-the-shelf process reward model (PRM), and (iii) stitch these highest-quality steps across trajectories into a composite rationale. This rationale then conditions an autoregressive (AR) model (solver) to recompute only the final answer. This modular pipeline separates exploration (diffusion) from evaluation and solution synthesis, avoiding monolithic unified hybrids while preserving broad search. Across math reasoning benchmarks, we find that step-level recombination is most beneficial on harder problems, and ablations highlight the importance of the final AR solver in converting stitched but imperfect rationales into accurate answers. Using low-confidence diffusion sampling with parallel, independent rollouts, our training-free framework improves average accuracy by up to 23.8% across six math and coding tasks.

By computing activation differences between original images and text-inpainted versions, we identify architecture-specific OCR bottlenecks whose dominant location depends on the vision-language integration strategy: DeepStack models (Qwen) show peak sensitivity at mid-depth (about 50%) for scene text, while single-stage projection models (Phi-4, InternVL) peak at early layers (6-25%), though the exact layer of maximum effect varies across datasets.

While effective in many settings, this constraint can limit flexibility in controlling attention magnitudes and may contribute to overly concentrated or unstable attention patterns during training. Prior work has explored modifications such as attention sinks or gating mechanisms, but these approaches provide only limited or indirect control over attention reweighting. We propose Affine-Scaled Attention, a simple extension to standard attention that introduces input-dependent scaling and a corresponding bias term applied to softmax-normalized attention weights. This design relaxes the strict normalization constraint while maintaining aggregation of value representations, allowing the model to adjust both the relative distribution and the scale of attention in a controlled manner.\n  We empirically evaluate Affine-Scaled Attention in large-scale language model pretraining across multiple model sizes. Experimental results show consistent improvements in training stability, optimization behavior, and downstream task performance compared to standard softmax attention and attention sink baselines. These findings suggest that modest reweighting of attention outputs provides a practical and effective way to improve attention behavior in Transformer models."}

This study investigates the fossilization and stability of the L2 syntax-prosody interface by comparing 67 native Mandarin speakers with 67 Vietnamese learners using the BLCU-SAIT corpus. By integrating C-ToBI boundary annotation with Dependency Grammar analysis, we examined both the quantity of prosodic boundaries and their mapping to syntactic relations. Results reveal a non-linear acquisition: although high-proficiency learners (VNH) converge to the native baseline in boundary quantity at the Major Phrase level (B3), their structural mapping significantly diverges. Specifically, VNH demote the prosodic boundary at the Subject-Verb (SBV) interface (Major Phrase B3 -> Prosodic Word B1), while erroneously promoting the boundary at the Verb-Object (VOB) interface (Prosodic Word B1 -> Major Phrase B3). This strategy allows learners to maintain high long phrasal output at the expense of structural accuracy. This results in a distorted prosodic hierarchy where the native pattern is inverted."}

We show this is not a failure of encoding: speaker identity, emotion, and visual attributes survive through every LLM layer (3--55$\\times$ above chance in linear probes), yet removing 64--71% of modality-specific variance improves decoder loss. The decoder has no learned use for these directions; their presence is noise.\n  We formalize this as a mismatched decoder problem: a decoder trained on text can only extract information along text-aligned directions. Accessible information is bounded by the Generalized Mutual Information (GMI), with degradation scaling with distributional distance and decoder sensitivity. The bound is a property of the decoder's scoring rule, not of any particular architecture; it applies whether non-text inputs arrive through a learned projection, a discrete codebook, or no explicit adapter at all. We validate this across five models spanning speech and vision. A controlled experiment (two Prismatic VLMs differing only in encoder text-alignment) confirms the bottleneck is the decoder's scoring rule, not the encoder or projection. A LoRA intervention demonstrates the fix: training with an emotion objective improves emotion accessibility ($+$7.5%) without affecting other attributes, confirming that the training objective determines what becomes accessible."}

Using linear attention models, we provide a theoretical analysis that characterizes how fine-tuning objectives modify attention parameters and identifies conditions under which this leads to degraded few-shot performance. We show that fine-tuning all attention parameters can harm in-context learning, whereas restricting updates to the value matrix improves zero-shot performance while preserving in-context learning.

In contrast, genuinely non-AR generation is promising because it removes AR's sequential bottleneck, better exploiting parallel hardware to reduce synchronization/communication overhead and improve latency scaling with output length. We argue that a primary driver of AR-like decoding is a mismatch between DLM objectives and the highly sequential structure of widely used training data, including standard pretraining corpora and long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision. Motivated by this diagnosis, we propose NAP (Non-Autoregressive Parallel DLMs), a proof-of-concept, data-centric approach that better aligns supervision with non-AR parallel decoding. NAP curates examples as multiple independent reasoning trajectories and couples them with a parallel-forced decoding strategy that encourages multi-token parallel updates. Across math reasoning benchmarks, NAP yields stronger performance under parallel decoding than DLMs trained on standard long CoT data, with gains growing as parallelism increases. Our results suggest that revisiting data and supervision is a principled direction for mitigating AR-like behavior and moving toward genuinely non-autoregressive parallel generation in DLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/pixeli99/NAP."}

Conventional ASR-LLM-TTS pipelines follow a strictly sequential paradigm, requiring complete transcription and full reasoning before speech synthesis can begin, which results in high response latency. We propose the Discourse-Aware Dual-Track Streaming Response (DDTSR) framework, a low-latency architecture that enables listen-while-thinking and speak-while-thinking. DDTSR is built upon three key mechanisms: (1) connective-guided small-large model synergy, where an auxiliary small model generates minimal-committal discourse connectives while a large model performs knowledge-intensive reasoning in parallel; (2) streaming-based cross-modal collaboration, which dynamically overlaps ASR, LLM inference, and TTS to advance the earliest speakable moment; and (3) curriculum-learning-based discourse continuity enhancement, which maintains coherence and logical consistency between early responses and subsequent reasoning outputs. Experiments on two spoken dialogue benchmarks demonstrate that DDTSR reduces response latency by 19%-51% while preserving discourse quality. Further analysis shows that DDTSR functions as a plug-and-play module compatible with diverse LLM backbones, and remains robust across varying utterance lengths, indicating strong practicality and scalability for real-time spoken interaction."}

Yet existing benchmarks are small, manually curated - and therefore error-prone - and contain shallow questions that seldom demand more than two hops or invoke aggregations, grouping, or other advanced analytical operations expressible in natural-language queries. We present SPARTA, an end-to-end construction framework that automatically generates large-scale Table-Text QA benchmarks with lightweight human validation, requiring only one quarter of the annotation time of HybridQA. The framework first constructs a reference fact database by enriching each source table with grounding tables whose tuples are atomic facts automatically extracted from the accompanying unstructured passages, then synthesizes nested queries whose number of nested predicates matches the desired hop count. To ensure that every SQL statement is executable and that its verbalization yields a fluent, human-sounding question, we propose two novel techniques: provenance-based refinement, which rewrites any syntactically valid query that returns a non-empty result, and realistic-structure enforcement, which confines generation to post-order traversals of the query graph. The resulting pipeline produces thousands of high-fidelity question-answer pairs covering aggregations, grouping, and deep multi-hop reasoning across text and tables. On SPARTA, state-of-the-art models that reach over 70 F1 on HybridQA or over 50 F1 on OTT-QA drop by more than 30 F1 points, exposing fundamental weaknesses in current cross-modal reasoning.

MiSTER-E leverages large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned for both speech and text to provide rich utterance-level embeddings, which are then enhanced through a convolutional-recurrent context modeling layer. The system integrates predictions from three experts-speech-only, text-only, and cross-modal-using a learned gating mechanism that dynamically weighs their outputs. To further encourage consistency and alignment across modalities, we introduce a supervised contrastive loss between paired speech-text representations and a KL-divergence-based regulariza-tion across expert predictions.

We posit that this behavior stems from a reporting bias in their training data. That is, how people communicate about visual content by default omits tacit information needed to supervise some types of reasoning; e.g., \"at the game today!\" is a more likely caption than \"a photo of 37 people standing behind a field\". We investigate the data underlying the popular VLMs OpenCLIP, LLaVA-1.5 and Molmo through the lens of theories from pragmatics, and find that reporting bias results in insufficient representation of four reasoning skills (spatial, temporal, negation, and counting), despite the corpora being of web-scale, and/or synthetically generated. With a set of curated benchmarks, we demonstrate that: (i) VLMs perform poorly on the aforementioned types of reasoning suppressed in the training data by reporting bias; (ii) contrary to popular belief, scaling data size, model size, and to multiple languages does not result in emergence of these skills by default; but, promisingly, (iii) incorporating annotations specifically collected to obtain tacit information is effective. Our findings highlight the need for more intentional training data curation methods, rather than counting on scale for emergence of reasoning capabilities."}

Existing methods use a calibrated scalar evaluator for the target objective to guide search, but for many tasks such scores are unavailable, too sparse, or unreliable. Pairwise comparisons, by contrast, are often easier to elicit, still provide useful signal on improvement directions, and can be obtained from the LLM itself without external supervision. Building on this observation, we introduce Duel-Evolve, an evolutionary optimization algorithm that replaces external scalar rewards with pairwise preferences elicited from the same LLM used to generate candidates. Duel-Evolve aggregates these noisy candidate comparisons via a Bayesian Bradley-Terry model, yielding uncertainty-aware estimates of candidate quality. These quality estimates guide allocation of the comparison budget toward plausible optima using Double Thompson Sampling, as well as selection of high-quality parents to generate improved candidates. We evaluate Duel-Evolve on MathBench, where it achieves 20 percentage points higher accuracy over existing methods and baselines, and on LiveCodeBench, where it improves over comparable iterative methods by over 12 percentage points. Notably, the method requires no reward model, no ground-truth labels during search, and no hand-crafted scoring function. Results show that pairwise self-preferences provide strong optimization signal for test-time improvement over large, discrete output spaces."}

We start from two empirical observations. First, a systematic user study shows that people consistently prefer quotations that are ``unexpected yet rational'' in context, identifying novelty as a key desideratum. Second, we find that strong existing models struggle to fully understand the deep meanings of quotations. Inspired by defamiliarization theory, we therefore formalize quote recommendation as choosing contextually novel but semantically coherent quotations. We operationalize this objective with NovelQR, a novelty-driven quotation recommendation framework. A generative label agent first interprets each quotation and its surrounding context into multi-dimensional deep-meaning labels, enabling label-enhanced retrieval. A token-level novelty estimator then reranks candidates while mitigating auto-regressive continuation bias. Experiments on bilingual datasets spanning diverse real-world domains show that our system recommends quotations that human judges rate as more appropriate, more novel, and more engaging than other baselines, while matching or surpassing existing methods in novelty estimation."}

However, current pipelines are limited by static chunking and flat retrieval: documents are split into short, predetermined, fixed-size chunks, embeddings are retrieved uniformly, and generation relies on whatever chunks are returned. This design brings challenges, as retrieval quality is highly sensitive to chunk size, often introduces noise from irrelevant or misleading chunks, and scales poorly to large corpora. We present SmartChunk retrieval, a query-adaptive framework for efficient and robust long-document question answering (QA). SmartChunk uses (i) a planner that predicts the optimal chunk abstraction level for each query, and (ii) a lightweight compression module that produces high-level chunk embeddings without repeated summarization. By adapting retrieval granularity on the fly, SmartChunk balances accuracy with efficiency and avoids the drawbacks of fixed strategies. Notably, our planner can reason about chunk abstractions through a novel reinforcement learning scheme, STITCH, which boosts accuracy and generalization. To reflect real-world applications, where users face diverse document types and query styles, we evaluate SmartChunk on five QA benchmarks plus one out-of-domain dataset. Across these evaluations, SmartChunk outperforms state-of-the-art RAG baselines, while reducing cost. Further analysis demonstrates strong scalability with larger corpora and consistent gains on out-of-domain datasets, highlighting its effectiveness as a general framework for adaptive retrieval."}

A crucial but under-explored aspect is the 'hooking period', the first three seconds that capture viewer attention and influence engagement metrics. Analyzing this brief window is challenging due to the multimodal nature of video content, which blends visual, auditory, and textual elements. Traditional methods often miss the nuanced interplay of these components, requiring advanced frameworks for thorough evaluation.\n  This study presents a framework using transformer-based multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to analyze the hooking period of video ads. It tests two frame sampling strategies, uniform random sampling and key frame selection, to ensure balanced and representative acoustic feature extraction, capturing the full range of design elements. The hooking video is processed by state-of-the-art MLLMs to generate descriptive analyses of the ad's initial impact, which are distilled into coherent topics using BERTopic for high-level abstraction. The framework also integrates features such as audio attributes and aggregated ad targeting information, enriching the feature set for further analysis.\n  Empirical validation on large-scale real-world data from social media platforms demonstrates the efficacy of our framework, revealing correlations between hooking period features and key performance metrics like conversion per investment. The results highlight the practical applicability and predictive power of the approach, offering valuable insights for optimizing video ad strategies. This study advances video ad analysis by providing a scalable methodology for understanding and enhancing the initial moments of video advertisements."}

This paradigm enables reasoning beyond discrete language tokens by performing multi-step computation in continuous latent spaces. Although there have been numerous studies focusing on improving the performance of latent reasoning, its internal mechanisms remain not fully investigated. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of latent reasoning methods to better understand the role and behavior of latent representation in the process. We identify two key issues across latent reasoning methods with different levels of supervision. First, we observe pervasive shortcut behavior, where they achieve high accuracy without relying on latent reasoning. Second, we examine the hypothesis that latent reasoning supports BFS-like exploration in latent space, and find that while latent representations can encode multiple possibilities, the reasoning process does not faithfully implement structured search, but instead exhibits implicit pruning and compression. Finally, our findings reveal a trade-off associated with supervision strength: stronger supervision mitigates shortcut behavior but restricts the ability of latent representations to maintain diverse hypotheses, whereas weaker supervision allows richer latent representations at the cost of increased shortcut behavior."}

To address these challenges, we introduce VERO (Versioning, Rewards, and Observations), which provides (1) a reproducible evaluation harness with versioned agent snapshots, budget-controlled evaluation, and structured execution traces, and (2) a benchmark suite of target agents and tasks with reference evaluation procedures. Using VERO, we conduct an empirical study comparing optimizer configurations across tasks and analyzing which modifications reliably improve target agent performance.

This position paper argues that potential blueprints for designing such modular language agents can be found in the existing literature on cognitive models and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. To make this point clear, we formalize the idea of an agent template that specifies roles for individual LLMs and how their functionalities should be composed. We then survey a variety of existing language agents in the literature and highlight their underlying templates derived directly from cognitive models or AI algorithms. By highlighting these designs, we aim to call attention to agent templates inspired by cognitive science and AI as a powerful tool for developing effective, interpretable language agents."}

We investigate whether this gap can be closed by integrating an instruction-tuned model (ITM) into an LRM. Analyzing their differences in parameter space, namely task vectors, we find that their principal subspaces are nearly orthogonal across key modules, suggesting a lightweight merging with minimal interference. However, we also demonstrate that naive merges are fragile because they overlook the output format mismatch between LRMs (with explicit thinking and response segments) and ITMs (answers-only). We introduce RAIN-Merging (Reasoning-Aware Instruction-attention guided Null-space projection Merging), a gradient-free method that integrates instruction following while preserving thinking format and reasoning performance. First, with a small reasoning calibration set, we project the ITM task vector onto the null space of forward features at thinking special tokens, which preserves the LRM's structured reasoning mechanisms. Second, using a small instruction calibration set, we estimate instruction attention to derive module-specific scaling that amplifies instruction-relevant components and suppresses leakage. Across four instruction-following benchmarks and nine reasoning & general capability benchmarks, RAIN-Merging substantially improves instruction adherence while maintaining reasoning quality. The gains are consistent across model scales and architectures, translating to improved performance in agent settings."}

It then performs adaptive reinforcement learning with Correctness-Preserving Advantage Shaping (CPAS) to avoid suppressing correct long-chain reasoning, and Length-Aware Gradient Regulation (LAGR) to stabilize optimization under severe reasoning-length heterogeneity.

We show that this instability arises from a previously underexplored gap between strategy usage-whether a reasoning strategy appears in successful solutions-and strategy executability-whether the strategy remains effective when instantiated as guidance for a target model. Through a controlled analysis of paired human-written and model-generated solutions, we identify a systematic dissociation between usage and executability: human- and model-derived strategies differ in structured, domain-dependent ways, leading to complementary strengths and consistent source-dependent reversals under guidance. Building on this diagnosis, we propose Selective Strategy Retrieval (SSR), a test-time framework that explicitly models executability by selectively retrieving and combining strategies using empirical, multi-route, source-aware signals. Across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, SSR yields reliable and consistent improvements over direct solving, in-context learning, and single-source guidance, improving accuracy by up to $+13$ points on AIME25 and $+5$ points on Apex for compact reasoning models.

However, real-world tabular datasets increasingly contain free-form text fields (e.g., reviews or clinical notes) alongside structured numerical and categorical attributes. Generating such heterogeneous tables with joint modeling of different modalities remains challenging. Existing approaches broadly fall into two categories: diffusion-based methods and LLM-based methods. Diffusion models can capture complex dependencies over numerical and categorical features in continuous or discrete spaces, but extending them to open-ended text is nontrivial and often leads to degraded text quality. In contrast, LLM-based generators naturally produce fluent text, yet their discrete tokenization can distort precise or wide-range numerical values, hindering accurate modeling of both numbers and language. In this work, we propose TabDLM, a unified framework for free-form tabular data generation via a joint numerical--language diffusion model built on masked diffusion language models (MDLMs). TabDLM models textual and categorical features through masked diffusion, while modeling numerical features with a continuous diffusion process through learned specialized numeric tokens embedding; bidirectional attention then captures cross-modality interactions within a single model. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of TabDLM compared to strong diffusion- and LLM-based baselines."}

To address this, we propose pQuant, a method that decouples parameters by splitting linear layers into two specialized branches: a dominant 1-bit branch for efficient computation and a compact high-precision branch dedicated to preserving the most sensitive parameters. Through tailored feature scaling, we explicitly guide the model to allocate sensitive parameters to the high-precision branch. Furthermore, we extend this branch into multiple, sparsely-activated experts, enabling efficient capacity scaling.

However, industrial recommender systems often benefit from restricting the output space to a constrained subset of items based on business logic (e.g. enforcing content freshness or product category), which standard autoregressive decoding cannot natively support. Moreover, existing constrained decoding methods that make use of prefix trees (Tries) incur severe latency penalties on hardware accelerators (TPUs/GPUs). In this work, we introduce STATIC (Sparse Transition Matrix-Accelerated Trie Index for Constrained Decoding), an efficient and scalable constrained decoding technique designed specifically for high-throughput LLM-based generative retrieval on TPUs/GPUs. By flattening the prefix tree into a static Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) matrix, we transform irregular tree traversals into fully vectorized sparse matrix operations, unlocking massive efficiency gains on hardware accelerators. We deploy STATIC on a large-scale industrial video recommendation platform serving billions of users. STATIC produces significant product metric impact with minimal latency overhead (0.033 ms per step and 0.25% of inference time), achieving a 948x speedup over a CPU trie implementation and a 47-1033x speedup over a hardware-accelerated binary-search baseline. Furthermore, the runtime overhead of STATIC remains extremely low across a wide range of practical configurations. To the best of our knowledge, STATIC enables the first production-scale deployment of strictly constrained generative retrieval.

We find that: (i) contextual influences often significantly shift decisions, even when only superficially relevant; (ii) baseline preferences are a poor predictor of directional steerability, as models can appear baseline-neutral yet exhibit systematic steerability asymmetry under influence; (iii) influences can backfire: models may explicitly claim neutrality or discount the contextual cue, yet their choices still shift, sometimes in the opposite direction; and (iv) reasoning reduces average sensitivity, but amplifies the effect of biased few-shot examples.

Gains are consistent at 1 GB scale (enwik9) and across Chinese and Arabic text. We further show that preprocessing accelerates compression for computationally expensive algorithms: the total wall-clock time including preprocessing is 3.1x faster than raw zstd-22 and 2.4x faster than raw LZMA, because the preprocessed input is substantially smaller. The method can be implemented in under 50 lines of code."}

Please refer to source code available at https://github.com/weAIDB/MoDora", "summary": "Semi-structured documents integrate diverse interleaved data elements (e.g., tables, charts, hierarchical paragraphs) arranged in various and often irregular layouts. These documents are widely observed across domains and account for a large portion of real-world data. However, existing methods struggle to support natural language question answering over these documents due to three main technical challenges: (1) The elements extracted by techniques like OCR are often fragmented and stripped of their original semantic context, making them inadequate for analysis. (2) Existing approaches lack effective representations to capture hierarchical structures within documents (e.g., associating tables with nested chapter titles) and to preserve layout-specific distinctions (e.g., differentiating sidebars from main content). (3) Answering questions often requires retrieving and aligning relevant information scattered across multiple regions or pages, such as linking a descriptive paragraph to table cells located elsewhere in the document.\n  To address these issues, we propose MoDora, an LLM-powered system for semi-structured document analysis. First, we adopt a local-alignment aggregation strategy to convert OCR-parsed elements into layout-aware components, and conduct type-specific information extraction for components with hierarchical titles or non-text elements. Second, we design the Component-Correlation Tree (CCTree) to hierarchically organize components, explicitly modeling inter-component relations and layout distinctions through a bottom-up cascade summarization process. Finally, we propose a question-type-aware retrieval strategy that supports (1) layout-based grid partitioning for location-based retrieval and (2) LLM-guided pruning for semantic-based retrieval. Experiments show MoDora outperforms baselines by 5.97%-61.07% in accuracy. The code is at https://github.com/weAIDB/MoDora."}

To address the severe scarcity of joint ASR and diarization resources for this language, we introduce Lipi-Ghor-882, a comprehensive 882-hour multi-speaker Bengali dataset. In this paper, detailing our submission to the DL Sprint 4.0 competition, we systematically evaluate various architectures and approaches for long-form Bengali speech. For ASR, we demonstrate that raw data scaling is ineffective; instead, targeted fine-tuning utilizing perfectly aligned annotations paired with synthetic acoustic degradation (noise and reverberation) emerges as the singular most effective approach. Conversely, for speaker diarization, we observed that global open-source state-of-the-art models (such as Diarizen) performed surprisingly poorly on this complex dataset. Extensive model retraining yielded negligible improvements; instead, strategic, heuristic post-processing of baseline model outputs proved to be the primary driver for increasing accuracy. Ultimately, this work outlines a highly optimized dual pipeline achieving a $\\sim$0.019 Real-Time Factor (RTF), establishing a practical, empirically backed benchmark for low-resource, long-form speech processing."}

Such capabilities could allow misaligned models to evade oversight mechanisms. Yet principled methods to detect and quantify such behaviours are lacking. Classical definitions of steganography, and detection methods based on them, require a known reference distribution of non-steganographic signals. For the case of steganographic reasoning in LLMs, knowing such a reference distribution is not feasible; this renders these approaches inapplicable. We propose an alternative, \\textbf{decision-theoretic view of steganography}. Our central insight is that steganography creates an asymmetry in usable information between agents who can and cannot decode the hidden content (present within a steganographic signal), and this otherwise latent asymmetry can be inferred from the agents' observable actions. To formalise this perspective, we introduce generalised $\\mathcal{V}$-information: a utilitarian framework for measuring the amount of usable information within some input. We use this to define the \\textbf{steganographic gap} -- a measure that quantifies steganography by comparing the downstream utility of the steganographic signal to agents that can and cannot decode the hidden content. We empirically validate our formalism, and show that it can be used to detect, quantify, and mitigate steganographic reasoning in LLMs."}

A key bottleneck is the key-value (KV) cache, whose size scales with sequence length and easily dominates the memory footprint of the model. Previous work proposed quantization methods that are focused on compressing the KV cache while maintaining its information. We introduce InnerQ, a hardware-aware KV-cache quantization scheme that lowers decode latency without sacrificing accuracy. InnerQ applies group-wise quantization while grouping the cache matrices over their inner dimension. Unlike previous work that group over the outer dimension, InnerQ aligns dequantization with the vector-matrix multiplication and enables scale factor reuse across GPU compute units. This reduces memory accesses and accelerates dequantization, yielding up to $22\\%$ speedup over previous work and up to $88\\%$ over half-precision vector-matrix multiplication. To preserve fidelity under aggressive compression, InnerQ incorporates (i) hybrid quantization, selecting symmetric or asymmetric quantization per group based on local statistics; (ii) high-precision windows for both the most recent tokens and the attention sink tokens to mitigate outlier leakage; and (iii) per-channel normalization of the key cache, computed once during prefill and folded into the query to avoid runtime overhead. Our evaluation experiments on Llama models shows that InnerQ maintains a few-shot GSM8K performance comparable to non-quantized KV caches and surpasses prior KV cache quantization methods."}

Current solutions often resort to rigid structural engineering or expensive fine-tuning, limiting their deployability and adaptability. We propose AgentDropoutV2, a test-time rectify-or-reject pruning framework designed to dynamically optimize MAS information flow without retraining. Our approach acts as an active firewall, intercepting agent outputs and employing a retrieval-augmented rectifier to iteratively correct errors based on a failure-driven indicator pool. This mechanism allows for the precise identification of potential errors using distilled failure patterns as prior knowledge. Irreparable outputs are subsequently pruned to prevent error propagation, while a fallback strategy preserves system integrity. Empirical results on extensive math benchmarks show that AgentDropoutV2 significantly boosts the MAS's task performance, achieving an average accuracy gain of 6.3 percentage points on math benchmarks. Furthermore, the system exhibits robust generalization and adaptivity, dynamically modulating rectification efforts based on task difficulty while leveraging context-aware indicators to resolve a wide spectrum of error patterns. Our code and dataset are released at https://github.com/TonySY2/AgentDropoutV2."}

This uncertainty is central to understanding both scientific acceleration and dual-use risk. We conducted a multi-model, multi-benchmark human uplift study comparing novices with LLM access versus internet-only access across eight biosecurity-relevant task sets. Participants worked on complex problems with ample time (up to 13 hours for the most involved tasks). We found that LLM access provided substantial uplift: novices with LLMs were 4.16 times more accurate than controls (95% CI [2.63, 6.87]). On four benchmarks with available expert baselines (internet-only), novices with LLMs outperformed experts on three of them. Perhaps surprisingly, standalone LLMs often exceeded LLM-assisted novices, indicating that users were not eliciting the strongest available contributions from the LLMs. Most participants (89.6%) reported little difficulty obtaining dual-use-relevant information despite safeguards. Overall, LLMs substantially uplift novices on biological tasks previously reserved for trained practitioners, underscoring the need for sustained, interactive uplift evaluations alongside traditional benchmarks."}
