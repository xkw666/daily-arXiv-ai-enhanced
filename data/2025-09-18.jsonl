We trained and evaluated two types of models: baseline support vector\nmachines (SVM) and BlueBERT which is a large language model pretrained on\nPubMed abstracts and hospitalized patient data. We assessed for\ngeneralizability of our model in two ways. First, we evaluated models trained\nusing Inst.-train on SF-test. Second, we trained a BlueBERT_TRANSFER model that\nwas first fine-tuned on Inst.-train then on SF-train before testing on SF-test\nset. To further analyze model performance, we also examined a subset of 59\nreports from our Inst. dataset, which were manually edited for clarity.\n  RESULTS Classification performance on the Inst. test achieved AUROC 0.82\nusing SVM and 0.81 using BlueBERT. Without cross-institution transfer learning,\nperformance on the SF test was limited to an AUROC of 0.42 using SVM and 0.56\nusing BlueBERT.

Previous studies have revealed the misalignment of\nLLMs with human values using expert-designed or agent-based emulated bias\nscenarios. However, it remains unclear whether the alignment of LLMs with human\nvalues differs across different types of scenarios (e.g., scenarios containing\nnegative vs. non-negative questions). In this study, we investigate the\nalignment of LLMs with human values regarding social biases (HVSB) in different\ntypes of bias scenarios. Through extensive analysis of 12 LLMs from four model\nfamilies and four datasets, we demonstrate that LLMs with large model parameter\nscales do not necessarily have lower misalignment rate and attack success rate.\nMoreover, LLMs show a certain degree of alignment preference for specific types\nof scenarios and the LLMs from the same model family tend to have higher\njudgment consistency. In addition, we study the understanding capacity of LLMs\nwith their explanations of HVSB. We find no significant differences in the\nunderstanding of HVSB across LLMs. We also find LLMs prefer their own generated\nexplanations. Additionally, we endow smaller language models (LMs) with the\nability to explain HVSB. The generation results show that the explanations\ngenerated by the fine-tuned smaller LMs are more readable, but have a\nrelatively lower model agreeability."}

Mobile code commonly\nsuffers from large amounts of stalls in the CPU frontend and thus starvation of\nthe rest of the CPU resources. Complexity of these applications and their code\nfootprint are projected to grow at a rate faster than available on-chip memory\ndue to power and area constraints, making conventional hardware-centric methods\nfor managing instruction caches to be inadequate. We present a novel\nsoftware-hardware co-design approach called TRRIP (Temperature-based\nRe-Reference Interval Prediction) that enables the compiler to analyze,\nclassify, and transform code based on \"temperature\" (hot/cold), and to provide\nthe hardware with a summary of code temperature information through a\nwell-defined OS interface based on using code page attributes. TRRIP's\nlightweight hardware extension employs code temperature attributes to optimize\nthe instruction cache replacement policy resulting in the eviction rate\nreduction of hot code. TRRIP is designed to be practical and adoptable in real\nmobile systems that have strict feature requirements on both the software and\nhardware components. TRRIP can reduce the L2 MPKI for instructions by 26.5%\nresulting in geomean speedup of 3.9%, on top of RRIP cache replacement running\nmobile code already optimized using PGO."}

However, this benefit comes with high\ncomputational costs: longer outputs increase latency, memory usage, and\nKV-cache demands. These issues are especially critical in software engineering\ntasks where concise and deterministic outputs are required. To investigate\nthese trade-offs, we conduct an empirical study based on code generation\nbenchmarks. The results reveal that longer CoT does not always help. Excessive\nreasoning often causes truncation, accuracy drops, and latency up to five times\nhigher, with failed outputs consistently longer than successful ones. These\nfindings challenge the assumption that longer reasoning is inherently better\nand highlight the need for adaptive CoT control. Motivated by this, we propose\nSEER (Self-Enhancing Efficient Reasoning), an adaptive framework that\ncompresses CoT while preserving accuracy. SEER combines Best-of-N sampling with\ntask-aware adaptive filtering, dynamically adjusting thresholds based on\npre-inference outputs to reduce verbosity and computational overhead. We then\nevaluate SEER on three software engineering tasks and one math task. On\naverage, SEER shortens CoT by 42.1%, improves accuracy by reducing truncation,\nand eliminates most infinite loops. These results demonstrate SEER as a\npractical method to make CoT-enhanced LLMs more efficient and robust, even\nunder resource constraints."}

This\npaper introduces a framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) into\nimmersive VR to create medically coherent virtual patients with distinct,\nconsistent personalities, built on a modular architecture that decouples\npersonality from clinical data. We evaluated our system in a mixed-method,\nwithin-subjects study with licensed physicians who engaged in simulated\nconsultations. Results demonstrate that the approach is not only feasible but\nis also perceived by physicians as a highly rewarding and effective training\nenhancement. Furthermore, our analysis uncovers critical design principles,\nincluding a ``realism-verbosity paradox\" where less communicative agents can\nseem more artificial, and the need for challenges to be perceived as authentic\nto be instructive.

However, current video large language models (VLLMs) and\nbenchmarks mostly rely on low-frame-rate sampling, such as uniform sampling or\nkeyframe selection, discarding dense temporal information. This compromise\navoids the high cost of tokenizing every frame, which otherwise leads to\nredundant computation and linear token growth as video length increases. While\nthis trade-off works for slowly changing content, it fails for tasks like\nlecture comprehension, where information appears in nearly every frame and\nrequires precise temporal alignment. To address this gap, we introduce Dense\nVideo Understanding (DVU), which enables high-FPS video comprehension by\nreducing both tokenization time and token overhead. Existing benchmarks are\nalso limited, as their QA pairs focus on coarse content changes. We therefore\npropose DIVE (Dense Information Video Evaluation), the first benchmark designed\nfor dense temporal reasoning. To make DVU practical, we present Gated Residual\nTokenization (GRT), a two-stage framework: (1) Motion-Compensated Inter-Gated\nTokenization uses pixel-level motion estimation to skip static regions during\ntokenization, achieving sub-linear growth in token count and compute. (2)\nSemantic-Scene Intra-Tokenization Merging fuses tokens across static regions\nwithin a scene, further reducing redundancy while preserving dynamic semantics.\nExperiments on DIVE show that GRT outperforms larger VLLM baselines and scales\npositively with FPS. These results highlight the importance of dense temporal\ninformation and demonstrate that GRT enables efficient, scalable high-FPS video\nunderstanding."}

To address this gap, we propose GEM-Bench, the first comprehensive\nbenchmark for ad-injected response generation in GEM. GEM-Bench includes three\ncurated datasets covering both chatbot and search scenarios, a metric ontology\nthat captures multiple dimensions of user satisfaction and engagement, and\nseveral baseline solutions implemented within an extensible multi-agent\nframework.

We find that the average\nactivations of test samples for the six training datasets encode the training\norder: when projected into a 2D subspace, these centroids are arranged exactly\nin the order of training and lie on a straight line. Further, we show that\nlinear probes can accurately (~90%) distinguish \"early\" vs. \"late\" entities,\ngeneralizing to entities unseen during the probes' own training. The model can\nalso be fine-tuned to explicitly report an unseen entity's training stage (~80%\naccuracy). Interestingly, this temporal signal does not seem attributable to\nsimple differences in activation magnitudes, losses, or model confidence.
