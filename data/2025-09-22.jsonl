We evaluate PILOT across three state-of-the-art\nLLMs (Mistral Large 2, Deepseek-R1, LLaMA 3.3 70B) using 25 synthetic personas\nunder three conditions: Natural-language Persona Steering (NPS), Schema-Based\nSteering (SBS), and Hybrid Persona-Schema Steering (HPS). Results demonstrate\nthat schema-based approaches significantly reduce artificial-sounding persona\nrepetition while improving output coherence, with silhouette scores increasing\nfrom 0.098 to 0.237 and topic purity from 0.773 to 0.957. Our analysis reveals\na fundamental trade-off: SBS produces more concise outputs with higher topical\nconsistency, while NPS offers greater lexical diversity but reduced\npredictability. HPS achieves a balance between these extremes, maintaining\noutput variety while preserving structural consistency. Expert linguistic\nevaluation confirms that PILOT maintains high response quality across all\nconditions, with no statistically significant differences between steering\napproaches."}

These models\ntypically undergo meticulous alignment procedures involving human feedback to\nensure the acceptance of safe inputs while rejecting harmful or unsafe ones.\nHowever, despite their massive scale and alignment efforts, LLMs remain\nvulnerable to jailbreak attacks, where malicious users manipulate the model to\nproduce harmful outputs that it was explicitly trained to avoid. In this study,\nwe find that the safety mechanisms in LLMs are predominantly embedded in the\nmiddle-to-late layers. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel white-box\njailbreak method, SABER (Safety Alignment Bypass via Extra Residuals), which\nconnects two intermediate layers $s$ and $e$ such that $s < e$, through a\nresidual connection. Our approach achieves a 51% improvement over the\nbest-performing baseline on the HarmBench test set. Furthermore, SABER induces\nonly a marginal shift in perplexity when evaluated on the HarmBench validation\nset. The source code is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/PalGitts/SABER."}

Existing defenses often demand costly retraining or\nsignificant architecture changes. We introduce a lightweight defense using\ntensor decomposition suitable for any pre-trained VLM, requiring no retraining.\nBy decomposing and reconstructing vision encoder representations, it filters\nadversarial noise while preserving meaning. Experiments with CLIP on COCO and\nFlickr30K show improved robustness. On Flickr30K, it restores 12.3\\%\nperformance lost to attacks, raising Recall@1 accuracy from 7.5\\% to 19.8\\%. On\nCOCO, it recovers 8.1\\% performance, improving accuracy from 3.8\\% to 11.9\\%.\nAnalysis shows Tensor Train decomposition with low rank (8-32) and low residual\nstrength ($\\alpha=0.1-0.2$) is optimal. This method is a practical,\nplug-and-play solution with minimal overhead for existing VLMs."}

Here, we draw inspiration from cognitive\nscience to argue that one weakness of machine learning systems is their failure\nto exhibit latent learning -- learning information that is not relevant to the\ntask at hand, but that might be useful in a future task. We show how this\nperspective links failures ranging from the reversal curse in language modeling\nto new findings on agent-based navigation. We then highlight how cognitive\nscience points to episodic memory as a potential part of the solution to these\nissues. Correspondingly, we show that a system with an oracle retrieval\nmechanism can use learning experiences more flexibly to generalize better\nacross many of these challenges. We also identify some of the essential\ncomponents for effectively using retrieval, including the importance of\nwithin-example in-context learning for acquiring the ability to use information\nacross retrieved examples. In summary, our results illustrate one possible\ncontributor to the relative data inefficiency of current machine learning\nsystems compared to natural intelligence, and help to understand how retrieval\nmethods can complement parametric learning to improve generalization."}

However, existing open-source\nmodels often suffer from a performance trade-off between these capabilities. We\npresent Manzano, a simple and scalable unified framework that substantially\nreduces this tension by coupling a hybrid image tokenizer with a well-curated\ntraining recipe. A single shared vision encoder feeds two lightweight adapters\nthat produce continuous embeddings for image-to-text understanding and discrete\ntokens for text-to-image generation within a common semantic space. A unified\nautoregressive LLM predicts high-level semantics in the form of text and image\ntokens, with an auxiliary diffusion decoder subsequently translating the image\ntokens into pixels. The architecture, together with a unified training recipe\nover understanding and generation data, enables scalable joint learning of both\ncapabilities. Manzano achieves state-of-the-art results among unified models,\nand is competitive with specialist models, particularly on text-rich\nevaluation. Our studies show minimal task conflicts and consistent gains from\nscaling model size, validating our design choice of a hybrid tokenizer."}
