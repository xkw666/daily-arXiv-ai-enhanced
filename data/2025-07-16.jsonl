This paper introduces a novel\napproach to combating misinformation by developing an AI-powered system that\nnot only fact-checks claims made in YouTube videos but also actively engages\nusers in the comment section and challenge misleading narratives. Our system\ncomprises two main agents: Truth Sleuth and Trend Bender.\n  Truth Sleuth extracts claims from a YouTube video, uses a Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) approach - drawing on sources like Wikipedia, Google Search,\nGoogle FactCheck - to accurately assess their veracity and generates a nuanced\nand comprehensive report. Through rigorous prompt engineering, Trend Bender\nleverages this report along with a curated corpus of relevant articles to\ngenerate insightful and persuasive comments designed to stimulate a productive\ndebate. With a carefully set up self-evaluation loop, this agent is able to\niteratively improve its style and refine its output.\n  We demonstrate the system's capabilities through experiments on established\nbenchmark datasets and a real-world deployment on YouTube, showcasing its\npotential to engage users and potentially influence perspectives. Our findings\nhighlight the high accuracy of our fact-checking agent, and confirm the\npotential of AI-driven interventions in combating misinformation and fostering\na more informed online space."}

In recent years, numerous machine learning-based methods have been\ndeveloped to detect hateful comments on online platforms automatically.\nHowever, research on Chinese hate speech detection lags behind, and\ninterpretability studies face two major challenges: first, the scarcity of\nspan-level fine-grained annotated datasets limits models' deep semantic\nunderstanding of hate speech; second, insufficient research on identifying and\ninterpreting coded hate speech restricts model explainability in complex\nreal-world scenarios. To address these, we make the following contributions:\n(1) We introduce the Span-level Target-Aware Toxicity Extraction dataset (STATE\nToxiCN), the first span-level Chinese hate speech dataset, and evaluate the\nhate semantic understanding of existing models using it. (2) We conduct the\nfirst comprehensive study on Chinese coded hate terms, LLMs' ability to\ninterpret hate semantics.

Our analysis identifies a paradigm shift\nin the 'locus of intelligence': from being encoded in external data (Semantic\nWeb) or the platform (MAS) to being embedded within the agent's core model\n(LLM). This shift is foundational to modern Agentic AI, enabling the scalable\nand adaptive systems the WoA has long envisioned. We conclude that while new\nprotocols are essential, they are insufficient for building a robust, open,\ntrustworthy ecosystem. Finally, we argue that the next research frontier lies\nin solving persistent socio-technical challenges, and we map out a new agenda\nfocused on decentralized identity, economic models, security, and governance\nfor the emerging WoA."}

This paper proposes a domain-adaptive\nsmall language model (SLM) with an encoder-decoder architecture for the\nenhanced prediction of product and service tax codes. In this approach, we\naddress the problem of predicting hierarchical tax code sequences using\nunstructured product and services data. We employ an SLM based upon\nencoder-decoder architecture as this enables sequential generation of tax codes\nto capture the hierarchical dependencies present within the tax codes. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that encoder-decoder SLMs can be successfully applied\nto the sequential prediction of structured tax codes, a domain that remains\ncomparatively unexplored in current NLP research. In this paper, we demonstrate\nthe superior performance of the domain-adaptive encoder-decoder SLMs over flat\nclassifiers when applied to the Harmonized System of Nomenclature (HSN), and\nachieve superior results compared to decoder-only and encoder-only\narchitectures for structured sequence generation tasks.

Existing compensation-based weight calibration methods\noften rely on a second-order Taylor expansion to model quantization error,\nunder the assumption that the first-order term is negligible in well-trained\nfull-precision models. However, we reveal that the progressive compensation\nprocess introduces accumulated first-order deviations between latent weights\nand their full-precision counterparts, making this assumption fundamentally\nflawed. To address this, we propose FOEM, a novel PTQ method that explicitly\nincorporates first-order gradient terms to improve quantization error\ncompensation. FOEM approximates gradients by directly computing the difference\nbetween latent and full-precision weights, avoiding the high cost and limited\ngeneralization of backpropagation-based gradient computation. This approach\nintroduces minimal additional computational overhead. Moreover, FOEM leverages\nprecomputed Cholesky factors to efficiently recover the inverse of Hessian\nsubmatrices in real time. Extensive experiments across a wide range of models\nand benchmarks demonstrate that FOEM consistently outperforms the classical\nGPTQ method. In 3-bit weight-only quantization, FOEM reduces the perplexity of\nLlama3-8B by 89.6%, and improves the 5-shot MMLU accuracy of Llama3-70B from\n51.7% to 74.9%, approaching the full-precision performance of 78.6%.\nFurthermore, FOEM can be seamlessly integrated with advanced techniques such as\nGPTAQ and SpinQuant, yielding additional improvements under the challenging\nW4A4KV4 setting, and further narrowing the accuracy gap with full-precision\nbaselines beyond what current state-of-the-art methods achieve.
