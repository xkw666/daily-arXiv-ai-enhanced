### [1] [DeBERTa-KC: A Transformer-Based Classifier for Knowledge Construction in Online Learning Discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19858)
*Jindi Wang,Yidi Zhang,Zhaoxing Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 开发了基于DeBERTa-KC的Transformer模型，通过Focal Loss等技术解决类别不平衡问题，在YouTube科学评论数据上实现了高效的知识构建级别分类（macro-F1 0.836）


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法难以大规模分析非正式数字学习环境中知识构建的难题，开发自动化工具来评估认知参与水平

Method: 扩展DeBERTa-v3模型，集成Focal Loss、Label Smoothing和R-Drop正则化，构建20,000样本平衡语料库，实施可复现的端到端处理流程（含10折分层交叉验证）

Result: macro-F1达0.836±0.008，显著优于基线模型(p<0.01)，对高阶认知类别（Explore/Negotiate）表现出强敏感性

Conclusion: 证明大语言模型能有效捕捉知识构建的细微特征，为数字学习环境的认知评估提供了可扩展的理论驱动解决方案

Abstract: This study presents DeBERTa-KC, a transformer-based model for automatic
classification of knowledge construction (KC) levels in online science learning
discourse. Using comments collected from four popular YouTube science channels
(2022--2024), a balanced corpus of 20,000 manually annotated samples was
created across four KC categories: \textit{nonKC}, \textit{Share},
\textit{Explore}, and \textit{Negotiate}. The proposed model extends DeBERTa-v3
with Focal Loss, Label Smoothing, and R-Drop regularization to address class
imbalance and enhance generalization. A reproducible end-to-end pipeline was
implemented, encompassing data extraction, annotation, preprocessing, training,
and evaluation. Across 10-fold stratified cross-validation, DeBERTa-KC achieved
a macro-F1 of $0.836 \pm 0.008$, significantly out-performing both classical
and transformer baselines ($p<0.01$). Per-category results indicate strong
sensitivity to higher-order epistemic engagement, particularly in
\textit{Explore} and \textit{Negotiate} discourse. These findings demonstrate
that large language models can effectively capture nuanced indicators of
knowledge construction in informal digital learning environments, offering
scalable, theory-informed approaches to discourse analysis and the development
of automated tools for assessing epistemic engagement.

### [2] [An Evaluation of the Pedagogical Soundness and Usability of AI-Generated Lesson Plans Across Different Models and Prompt Frameworks in High-School Physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19866)
*Xincheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 五大AI模型生成高中物理教案评估显示：模型选择主导可读性（DeepSeek最优），提示框架决定准确性（RACE框架最佳），学习目标普遍停留在低阶认知层次。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估不同大语言模型（ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini等）和提示框架（TAG/RACE/COSTAR）生成物理教案的教学合理性与技术可靠性

Method: 生成15份电磁波谱教案，通过四项指标分析：可读性、事实准确性、课程标准对齐、认知需求层级

Result: DeepSeek可读性最佳（FKGL=8.64），RACE框架实现最低幻觉率+最高NGSS标准对齐，所有教案学习目标80%集中在布鲁姆低阶认知（记忆/理解）

Conclusion: 最优方案=可读性优化模型+RACE框架+明确物理概念清单。模型设计决定语言复杂度，提示框架影响教学可靠性。

Abstract: This study evaluates the pedagogical soundness and usability of AI-generated
lesson plans across five leading large language models: ChatGPT (GPT-5), Claude
Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, DeepSeek V3.2, and Grok 4. Beyond model choice,
three structured prompt frameworks were tested: TAG (Task, Audience, Goal),
RACE (Role, Audience, Context, Execution), and COSTAR (Context, Objective,
Style, Tone, Audience, Response Format).
  Fifteen lesson plans were generated for a single high-school physics topic,
The Electromagnetic Spectrum. The lesson plans were analyzed through four
automated computational metrics: (1) readability and linguistic complexity, (2)
factual accuracy and hallucination detection, (3) standards and curriculum
alignment, and (4) cognitive demand of learning objectives.
  Results indicate that model selection exerted the strongest influence on
linguistic accessibility, with DeepSeek producing the most readable teaching
plan (FKGL = 8.64) and Claude generating the densest language (FKGL = 19.89).
  The prompt framework structure most strongly affected the factual accuracy
and pedagogical completeness, with the RACE framework yielding the lowest
hallucination index and the highest incidental alignment with NGSS curriculum
standards. Across all models, the learning objectives in the fifteen lesson
plans clustered at the Remember and Understand tiers of Bloom's taxonomy. There
were limited higher-order verbs in the learning objectives extracted.
  Overall, the findings suggest that readability is significantly governed by
model design, while instructional reliability and curricular alignment depend
more on the prompt framework. The most effective configuration for lesson plans
identified in the results was to combine a readability-optimized model with the
RACE framework and an explicit checklist of physics concepts, curriculum
standards, and higher-order objectives.

### [3] [From Denoising to Refining: A Corrective Framework for Vision-Language Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19871)
*Yatai Ji,Teng Wang,Yuying Ge,Zhiheng Liu,Sidi Yang,Ying Shan,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出ReDiff框架，通过主动精炼和在线自校正机制解决离散扩散模型的错误级联问题，显著提升生成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散扩散模型的训练-推理差异导致并行解码时初始错误污染上下文，引发语义幻觉和句法错误的恶性循环

Method: 两阶段训练：1) 基于合成错误构建基础修正能力 2) 在线自校正循环实现错误驱动学习，通过专家校正引导模型自我修复

Result: 实验证明ReDiff在保持并行效率的同时，生成内容的连贯性和事实准确性显著优于传统去噪方法

Conclusion: 主动精炼范式突破了被动去噪的局限，错误驱动的自校正机制为稳定高效的并行生成开辟了新方向

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a promising direction for
vision-language tasks, offering bidirectional context modeling and theoretical
parallelization. However, their practical application is severely hindered by a
train-inference discrepancy, which leads to catastrophic error cascades:
initial token errors during parallel decoding pollute the generation context,
triggering a chain reaction of compounding errors and leading to syntactic
errors and semantic hallucinations. To address this fundamental challenge, we
reframe the generation process from passive denoising to active refining. We
introduce ReDiff, a refining-enhanced diffusion framework that teaches the
model to identify and correct its own errors. Our approach features a two-stage
training process: first, we instill a foundational revision capability by
training the model to revise synthetic errors; second, we implement a novel
online self-correction loop where the model is explicitly trained to revise its
own flawed drafts by learning from an expert's corrections. This mistake-driven
learning endows the model with the crucial ability to revisit and refine its
already generated output, effectively breaking the error cascade. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ReDiff significantly improves the coherence and
factual accuracy of generated content, enabling stable and efficient parallel
generation far superior to traditional denoising methods. Our codes and models
are available at https://rediff-hku.github.io/.

### [4] [Stream: Scaling up Mechanistic Interpretability to Long Context in LLMs via Sparse Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19875)
*J Rosser,José Luis Redondo García,Gustavo Penha,Konstantina Palla,Hugues Bouchard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Sparse Tracing技术和Stream算法，通过动态稀疏注意力实现长上下文LLM的高效可解释性分析，将复杂度降至近线性级别


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统注意力机制分析方法的二次方复杂度导致处理百万token级上下文时需要TB级内存，难以实用化

Method: 开发Stream分层剪枝算法：1）通过二分搜索式优化保留每个query的top-k关键块 2）保持模型预测效果 3）实现近线性时间O(T logT)和线性空间复杂度

Result: 在长思维链推理中剪枝97-99% token交互，RULER基准下保留关键检索路径(剪枝90-96%)并暴露从关键信息到输出的分层路径

Conclusion: 首次实现消费级GPU的长上下文可解释性分析，通过动态稀疏注意力与高效算法设计，为模型透明度研究提供实用工具，代码已开源

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale to million-token contexts, traditional
Mechanistic Interpretability techniques for analyzing attention scale
quadratically with context length, demanding terabytes of memory beyond 100,000
tokens. We introduce Sparse Tracing, a novel technique that leverages dynamic
sparse attention to efficiently analyze long context attention patterns. We
present Stream, a compilable hierarchical pruning algorithm that estimates
per-head sparse attention masks in near-linear time $O(T \log T)$ and linear
space $O(T)$, enabling one-pass interpretability at scale. Stream performs a
binary-search-style refinement to retain only the top-$k$ key blocks per query
while preserving the model's next-token behavior. We apply Stream to long
chain-of-thought reasoning traces and identify thought anchors while pruning
97-99\% of token interactions. On the RULER benchmark, Stream preserves
critical retrieval paths while discarding 90-96\% of interactions and exposes
layer-wise routes from the needle to output. Our method offers a practical
drop-in tool for analyzing attention patterns and tracing information flow
without terabytes of caches. By making long context interpretability feasible
on consumer GPUs, Sparse Tracing helps democratize chain-of-thought monitoring.

### [5] [Automated HIV Screening on Dutch EHR with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19879)
*Lang Zhou,Amrish Jhingoer,Yinghao Luo,Klaske Vliegenthart--Jongbloed,Carlijn Jordans,Ben Werkhoven,Tom Seinen,Erik van Mulligen,Casper Rokx,Yunlei Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 利用大语言模型分析非结构化电子健康记录文本，提升HIV检测效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HIV诊断研究主要依赖结构化数据，忽略临床文本中的关键风险信息。本研究旨在通过挖掘非结构化EHR文本提升HIV检测候选者筛选精度。

Method: 开发基于LLM的流程分析EHR非结构化文本，实验数据来自荷兰伊拉斯谟大学医学中心的临床记录

Result: 模型在保持低假阴性率（2.1%）的同时达到89.6%的准确率

Conclusion: 通过LLM挖掘非结构化临床文本能有效识别HIV检测候选者，有助于实现早期诊断并降低传播风险

Abstract: Efficient screening and early diagnosis of HIV are critical for reducing
onward transmission. Although large scale laboratory testing is not feasible,
the widespread adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offers new
opportunities to address this challenge. Existing research primarily focuses on
applying machine learning methods to structured data, such as patient
demographics, for improving HIV diagnosis. However, these approaches often
overlook unstructured text data such as clinical notes, which potentially
contain valuable information relevant to HIV risk. In this study, we propose a
novel pipeline that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze
unstructured EHR text and determine a patient's eligibility for further HIV
testing. Experimental results on clinical data from Erasmus University Medical
Center Rotterdam demonstrate that our pipeline achieved high accuracy while
maintaining a low false negative rate.

### [6] [An Expert-grounded benchmark of General Purpose LLMs in LCA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19886)
*Artur Donaldson,Bharathan Balaji,Cajetan Oriekezie,Manish Kumar,Laure Patouillard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现通用大语言模型在生命周期评估应用中存在37%信息失真风险，开源模型表现与闭源模型相当，需验证机制保障可靠性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在LCA中的可靠性，填补该领域缺乏系统性评估框架和共识协议的空白

Method: 11个通用LLM模型在22项LCA任务中接受17位专家评审，168份专家评估聚焦科学准确性、解释质量等维度

Result: 37%回答含误导信息，幻觉引用率最高达40%；开源模型在准确性等指标上与闭源模型相当甚至更优

Conclusion: LLMs在解释质量与简化常规任务方面具有潜力，但需建立验证机制防范信息失真风险

Abstract: Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI), and in particular large language
models (LLMs), are increasingly being explored as tools to support life cycle
assessment (LCA). While demonstrations exist across environmental and social
domains, systematic evidence on their reliability, robustness, and usability
remains limited. This study provides the first expert-grounded benchmark of
LLMs in LCA, addressing the absence of standardized evaluation frameworks in a
field where no clear ground truth or consensus protocols exist.
  Methods: We evaluated eleven general-purpose LLMs, spanning both commercial
and open-source families, across 22 LCA-related tasks. Seventeen experienced
practitioners reviewed model outputs against criteria directly relevant to LCA
practice, including scientific accuracy, explanation quality, robustness,
verifiability, and adherence to instructions. We collected 168 expert reviews.
  Results: Experts judged 37% of responses to contain inaccurate or misleading
information. Ratings of accuracy and quality of explanation were generally
rated average or good on many models even smaller models, and format adherence
was generally rated favourably. Hallucination rates varied significantly, with
some models producing hallucinated citations at rates of up to 40%. There was
no clear-cut distinction between ratings on open-weight versus closed-weight
LLMs, with open-weight models outperforming or competing on par with
closed-weight models on criteria such as accuracy and quality of explanation.
  Conclusion: These findings highlight the risks of applying LLMs na\"ively in
LCA, such as when LLMs are treated as free-form oracles, while also showing
benefits especially around quality of explanation and alleviating labour
intensiveness of simple tasks. The use of general-purpose LLMs without
grounding mechanisms presents ...

### [7] [Can They Dixit? Yes they Can! Dixit as a Playground for Multimodal Language Model Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19892)
*Nishant Balepur,Dang Nguyen,Dayeon Ki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于Dixit卡牌游戏的评估框架，通过多维度竞争性测试揭示多模态大语言模型能力，验证其与现有基准结果的高度相关性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态基准测试无法综合评价MLM能力，成对比较方法存在主观性强、成本高、易受模型表面策略干扰等问题

Method: 将Dixit卡牌游戏改造为评估框架（需同时生成迷惑性描述、策略推理等多模态能力），定量分析5个MLM的胜率及人机对战策略差异

Result: Dixit胜率排名与主流基准完全正相关；人机对战揭示MLM在上下文推理、策略连贯性方面存在改进空间

Conclusion: 基于游戏的评估方法兼具客观性、多维性和趣味性，为MLM能力评估提供新范式，未来可扩展至其他复杂任务场景

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLMs) are often assessed on static,
individual benchmarks -- which cannot jointly assess MLM capabilities in a
single task -- or rely on human or model pairwise comparisons -- which is
highly subjective, expensive, and allows models to exploit superficial
shortcuts (e.g., verbosity) to inflate their win-rates. To overcome these
issues, we propose game-based evaluations to holistically assess MLM
capabilities. Games require multiple abilities for players to win, are
inherently competitive, and are governed by fix, objective rules, and makes
evaluation more engaging, providing a robust framework to address the
aforementioned challenges. We manifest this evaluation specifically through
Dixit, a fantasy card game where players must generate captions for a card that
trick some, but not all players, into selecting the played card. Our
quantitative experiments with five MLMs show Dixit win-rate rankings are
perfectly correlated with those on popular MLM benchmarks, while games between
human and MLM players in Dixit reveal several differences between agent
strategies and areas of improvement for MLM reasoning.

### [8] [Large Language Model enabled Mathematical Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19895)
*Guoyun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨如何将大语言模型（DeepSeek-R1）与优化建模结合，通过自然语言处理和代码生成能力解决运筹学中的模型构建难题，并在四个关键基准测试中系统评估其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统运筹学优化方法依赖专家知识，现有LLMs（如GPT-4）存在高成本和幻觉问题。DeepSeek-R1作为高性价比模型，在应用场景中的有效性尚未充分验证。

Method: 在NL4OPT、IndustryOR、EasyLP和ComplexOR四个基准测试中，采用基线评估、幻觉分类法和缓解策略（LLM-as-a-Judge、Few-shot学习、工具调用和多智能体框架）。

Result: 提出的缓解策略有效减少模型幻觉，提升数学建模准确性，并更好对齐用户需求，验证了DeepSeek-R1在运筹学应用中的潜力。

Conclusion: DeepSeek-R1可作为传统LLMs的替代方案，其与优化技术的结合为自动化决策支持系统开辟新方向，特别在供应链管理场景中具有应用前景。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with optimization modeling
offers a promising avenue for advancing decision-making in operations research
(OR). Traditional optimization methods,such as linear programming, mixed
integer programming, and simulation depend heavily on domain expertise to
translate real-world problems into solvable mathematical models. While solvers
like Gurobi and COPT are powerful, expert input remains essential for defining
objectives, constraints, and variables. This research investigates the
potential of LLMs, specifically the DeepSeek-R1 model, to bridge this
formulation gap using natural language understanding and code generation.
Although prior models like GPT-4, Claude, and Bard have shown strong
performance in NLP and reasoning tasks, their high token costs and tendency
toward hallucinations limit real-world applicability in supply chain contexts.
In contrast, DeepSeek-R1, a cost-efficient and high-performing model trained
with reinforcement learning, presents a viable alternative. Despite its success
in benchmarks such as LiveCodeBench and Math-500, its effectiveness in applied
OR scenarios remains under explored. This study systematically evaluates
DeepSeek-R1 across four key OR benchmarks: NL4OPT, IndustryOR, EasyLP, and
ComplexOR. Our methodology includes baseline assessments, the development of a
hallucination taxonomy, and the application of mitigation strategies like
LLM-as-a-Judge, Few-shot Learning (FSL), Tool Calling, and a Multi-agent
Framework. These techniques aim to reduce hallucinations, enhance formulation
accuracy, and better align model outputs with user intent.

### [9] [Learning from Supervision with Semantic and Episodic Memory: A Reflective Approach to Agent Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19897)
*Jackson Hassell,Dan Zhang,Hannah Kim,Tom Mitchell,Estevam Hruschka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出记忆增强框架提升LLM代理分类性能，比RAG基线提升24.8%准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微调方法存在成本高、灵活性差和可解释性低的问题，需要更高效的监督学习范式

Method: 双记忆系统：情景记忆存储实例级批判反馈，语义记忆提炼可复用任务级指导

Result: OpenAI与开源模型在事实/偏好数据处理上表现差异显著，新指标suggestibility量化模型监督敏感性

Conclusion: 记忆驱动的反思学习机制为构建自适应、可解释的LLM代理提供了新路径

Abstract: We investigate how agents built on pretrained large language models can learn
target classification functions from labeled examples without parameter
updates. While conventional approaches like fine-tuning are often costly,
inflexible, and opaque, we propose a memory-augmented framework that leverages
both labeled data and LLM-generated critiques. Our framework uses episodic
memory to store instance-level critiques-capturing specific past
experiences-and semantic memory to distill these into reusable, task-level
guidance. Across a diverse set of tasks, incorporating critiques yields up to a
24.8 percent accuracy improvement over retrieval-based (RAG-style) baselines
that rely only on labels. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we uncover
distinct behavioral differences between OpenAI and opensource models,
particularly in how they handle fact-oriented versus preference-based data. To
interpret how models respond to different representations of supervision
encoded in memory, we introduce a novel metric, suggestibility. This helps
explain observed behaviors and illuminates how model characteristics and memory
strategies jointly shape learning dynamics. Our findings highlight the promise
of memory-driven, reflective learning for building more adaptive and
interpretable LLM agents.

*Le Ren,Xiangjian Zeng,Qingqiang Wu,Ruoxuan Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LyriCAR是一个无监督歌词翻译框架，通过难度感知课程设计和自适应策略优化训练效率，在EN-ZH任务中实现SOTA效果并减少40%训练步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有歌词翻译方法依赖手工规则和句子级建模，难以捕捉段落级音乐语言特征（如跨行连贯性和全局押韵）。

Method: 1. 难度感知课程设计器分配训练资源
2. 自适应课程策略逐步增加任务复杂度
3. 双策略协同加速模型收敛

Result: 在标准翻译指标和多维奖励分数上超越基线，自适应策略节省40%训练成本且保持性能优势

Conclusion: 该框架通过智能训练资源分配实现了高效收敛与质量提升，公开的代码/数据为后续研究提供基础。

Abstract: Lyric translation is a challenging task that requires balancing multiple
musical constraints. Existing methods often rely on hand-crafted rules and
sentence-level modeling, which restrict their ability to internalize
musical-linguistic patterns and to generalize effectively at the paragraph
level, where cross-line coherence and global rhyme are crucial. In this work,
we propose LyriCAR, a novel framework for controllable lyric translation that
operates in a fully unsupervised manner. LyriCAR introduces a difficulty-aware
curriculum designer and an adaptive curriculum strategy, ensuring efficient
allocation of training resources, accelerating convergence, and improving
overall translation quality by guiding the model with increasingly complex
challenges. Extensive experiments on the EN-ZH lyric translation task show that
LyriCAR achieves state-of-the-art results across both standard translation
metrics and multi-dimensional reward scores, surpassing strong baselines.
Notably, the adaptive curriculum strategy reduces training steps by nearly 40%
while maintaining superior performance. Code, data and model can be accessed at

*Xin Lian,Kenneth D. Forbus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出结合大语言模型与符号自然语言理解系统的混合方法，在常识科学文本处理任务中显著优于纯符号系统


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型存在幻觉和输出不稳定的缺陷，符号系统虽具备结构化表示能力但覆盖范围有限。希望通过融合两种技术实现优势互补

Method: 使用LLM进行文本重写/简化与知识填充，结合符号NLU生成结构化关系表示以支持推理和增量学习

Result: 在科学文本的数量关系提取和因果规律解析任务中，混合方法比纯符号系统表现显著更好

Conclusion: LLM的广泛覆盖能力与符号系统的结构化表示能力形成有效互补，为自然语言理解系统设计提供了新方向

Abstract: Despite the broad applicability of large language models (LLMs), their
reliance on probabilistic inference makes them vulnerable to errors such as
hallucination in generated facts and inconsistent output structure in natural
language understanding (NLU) tasks. By contrast, symbolic NLU systems provide
interpretable understanding grounded in curated lexicons, semantic resources,
and syntactic & semantic interpretation rules. They produce relational
representations that can be used for accurate reasoning and planning, as well
as incremental debuggable learning. However, symbolic NLU systems tend to be
more limited in coverage than LLMs and require scarce knowledge representation
and linguistics skills to extend and maintain. This paper explores a hybrid
approach that integrates the broad-coverage language processing of LLMs with
the symbolic NLU capabilities of producing structured relational
representations to hopefully get the best of both approaches. We use LLMs for
rephrasing and text simplification, to provide broad coverage, and as a source
of information to fill in knowledge gaps more automatically. We use symbolic
NLU to produce representations that can be used for reasoning and for
incremental learning. We evaluate this approach on the task of extracting and
interpreting quantities and causal laws from commonsense science texts, along
with symbolic- and LLM-only pipelines. Our results suggest that our hybrid
method works significantly better than the symbolic-only pipeline.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的自然语言依存解析算法，模仿人脑处理方式，理论复杂度O(n³)但在实际语言中表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统短语结构解析器在处理自然语言时效率较低，无法模拟人脑的实时处理机制。本研究旨在开发一种逐个单词处理的依存解析算法，以更接近人脑的解析方式，提升效率和适用性。

Method: 该算法采用逐个单词处理的方式，在能够连接时立即建立依存关系。这种逐步解析方法避免了传统方法中的复杂结构分析，通过动态决策实现高效解析。

Result: 理论分析显示算法的最坏时间复杂度为O(n³)，但实证研究表明在自然语言中，该复杂度仅在小规模输入时出现，实际解析效率显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该依存解析算法成功模拟了人脑的实时处理机制，在保持理论严谨性的同时，为自然语言处理提供了更高效的解析方案，具有重要的应用价值。

Abstract: This paper presents a fundamental algorithm for parsing natural language
sentences into dependency trees. Unlike phrase-structure (constituency)
parsers, this algorithm operates one word at a time, attaching each word as
soon as it can be attached, corresponding to properties claimed for the parser
in the human brain. Like phrase-structure parsing, its worst-case complexity is
$O(n^3)$, but in human language, the worst case occurs only for small $n$.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出临床决策二维评估范式（临床背景+临床问题），突破传统QA简化评估，建立更贴近真实场景的LLM评估体系


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学数据集（如MedQA）采用简化的问答形式，无法反映真实临床决策的复杂性

Method: 1. 建立二维评估框架（背景复杂度+问题类型）
2. 系统性总结训练方法（预训练/微调）和推理技术（CoT等）
3. 扩展评估维度（效率/可解释性）

Result: 1. 揭示数据集设置与临床真实性的关联性
2. 验证不同技术在不同复杂度任务中的有效性
3. 建立多维评估标准体系

Conclusion: 该范式为临床LLM开发提供标准化框架：明确模型假设、统一评估基准、指导开发具有临床实用价值的大模型

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for clinical use. They are often
evaluated using datasets such as MedQA. However, Many medical datasets, such as
MedQA, rely on simplified Question-Answering (Q\A) that underrepresents
real-world clinical decision-making. Based on this, we propose a unifying
paradigm that characterizes clinical decision-making tasks along two
dimensions: Clinical Backgrounds and Clinical Questions. As the background and
questions approach the real clinical environment, the difficulty increases. We
summarize the settings of existing datasets and benchmarks along two
dimensions. Then we review methods to address clinical decision-making,
including training-time and test-time techniques, and summarize when they help.
Next, we extend evaluation beyond accuracy to include efficiency,
explainability. Finally, we highlight open challenges. Our paradigm clarifies
assumptions, standardizes comparisons, and guides the development of clinically
meaningful LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Greek Embedding Models系列模型，通过高质量数据构建和多样化架构训练，显著提升希腊语NLP在法律等专业领域的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对希腊语等形态丰富语言的NLP发展受限问题，特别是在法律领域存在模型架构陈旧和上下文长度不足的缺陷。

Method: 构建大规模希腊语语料库并进行质量过滤，预训练ELECTRA/ConvBERT/ModernBERT等现代架构，开发首个法律领域希腊-英语双语模型。

Result: GEM-RoBERTa和GEM-ConvBERT模型在多个下游任务中显著超越现有基准模型。

Conclusion: 通过数据质量优化和架构创新，成功提升了希腊语NLP性能，填补了法律领域长文本处理的技术空白。

Abstract: The advancement of natural language processing for morphologically rich,
moderately-resourced languages like Modern Greek is often hindered by a
fragmented research landscape, a lack of architectural diversity and reliance
on limited context-length models. This is particularly true in specialized,
high-value domains such as law, where existing models are frequently confined
to early transformer architectures with a restrictive 512-token window,
insufficient for analyzing long legal documents. To address these challenges,
this paper presents Greek Embedding Models, a new family of transformer models
for Greek language built upon a foundation of extensive, quality-driven data
curation. We detail the construction of several large-scale Greek corpora,
emphasizing a rigorous, quality-based filtering and preprocessing methodology
to create high-value training datasets from both general-domain and specialized
legal sources. On this carefully curated foundation, we pre-train and
systematically evaluate a diverse suite of modern architectures, which has not

Furthermore, we propose the first bilingual Greek-English Embedding Models
tailored for the legal domain. The extensive experiments on downstream tasks
demonstrate that the new class of models establish the effectiveness of the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统序列标注任务的迁移学习方法未能充分挖掘预训练语言模型的潜力，尤其在领域迁移、信息流动方向、生成式模型应用方面存在局限。

Method: 1. 多任务模型融合领域无关文本处理系统的信号
2. 改进自回归大语言模型的架构实现跨层双向信息流
3. 构建生成式监督上下文微调框架（结合响应导向的适配策略）

Result: 在事件触发检测等任务中，针对性迁移学习方法使预训练模型达到最优性能表现，尤其在跨领域适应、上下文建模方面提升显著。

Conclusion: 通过领域信号融合、架构改造、生成式微调三位一体的迁移学习范式，能最大限度释放预训练模型在序列标注任务中的潜力，为NLP迁移学习提供系统方法论。

Abstract: This doctoral thesis improves the transfer learning for sequence labeling
tasks by adapting pre-trained neural language models. The proposed improvements
in transfer learning involve introducing a multi-task model that incorporates
an additional signal, a method based on architectural modifications in
autoregressive large language models, and a sequence labeling framework for
autoregressive large language models utilizing supervised in-context
fine-tuning combined with response-oriented adaptation strategies. The first
improvement is given in the context of domain transfer for the event trigger
detection task. The domain transfer of the event trigger detection task can be
improved by incorporating an additional signal obtained from a
domain-independent text processing system into a multi-task model. The second
improvement involves modifying the model's architecture. For that purpose, a
method is proposed to enable bidirectional information flow across layers of
autoregressive large language models. The third improvement utilizes
autoregressive large language models as text generators through a generative
supervised in-context fine-tuning framework. The proposed model, method, and
framework demonstrate that pre-trained neural language models achieve their
best performance on sequence labeling tasks when adapted through targeted
transfer learning paradigms.

TL;DR: 提出ToolScope框架（包含工具合并组件和工具检索组件），显著提升大语言模型工具选择的准确率（8.38%-38.6%）


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM工具使用存在两大痛点：1）工具集冗余导致名称/功能重叠，2）输入上下文长度限制阻碍大规模工具集的调用。这导致工具选择准确率下降。

Method: 1）ToolScopeMerger：通过自动校正机制合并冗余工具；2）ToolScopeRetriever：基于相关性排序压缩工具集，适配上下文长度限制

Result: 在3个SOTA大模型和3个开源工具使用基准测试中，工具选择准确率提升8.38%-38.6%

Conclusion: ToolScope通过工具集优化和上下文压缩机制，有效解决工具冗余与长度限制问题，显著提升LLM工具调用效能，实验验证了方案的有效性

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents rely on external tools to solve complex
tasks, but real-world toolsets often contain redundant tools with overlapping
names and descriptions, introducing ambiguity and reducing selection accuracy.
LLMs also face strict input context limits, preventing efficient consideration
of large toolsets. To address these challenges, we propose ToolScope, which
includes: (1) ToolScopeMerger with Auto-Correction to automatically audit and
fix tool merges, reducing redundancy, and (2) ToolScopeRetriever to rank and
select only the most relevant tools for each query, compressing toolsets to fit
within context limits without sacrificing accuracy. Evaluations on three
state-of-the-art LLMs and three open-source tool-use benchmarks show gains of
8.38% to 38.6% in tool selection accuracy, demonstrating ToolScope's
effectiveness in enhancing LLM tool use.

Abstract: Recent progress in NLP research has demonstrated remarkable capabilities of
large language models (LLMs) across a wide range of tasks. While recent
multilingual benchmarks have advanced cultural evaluation for LLMs, critical
gaps remain in capturing the nuances of low-resource cultures. Our work
addresses these limitations through a Bengali Language Cultural Knowledge
(BLanCK) dataset including folk traditions, culinary arts, and regional
dialects. Our investigation of several multilingual language models shows that
while these models perform well in non-cultural categories, they struggle
significantly with cultural knowledge and performance improves substantially
across all models when context is provided, emphasizing context-aware
architectures and culturally curated training data.

Motivation: 解决波斯语等资源稀缺语言在专业领域（如医疗问答）中语言模型推理能力不足的问题，探索小样本高效训练的可能性。

Method: 1. 将医疗多选题数据集翻译成波斯语
2. 通过RLAIF生成偏好/拒绝答案对
3. 构建包含200万token偏好答案和250万token拒绝答案的CoT数据集
4. 使用DPO进行模型微调

Conclusion: 基于推理优化的训练方法能高效开发专业领域语言模型，在数据有限情况下仍可取得优异性能，为低资源语言NLP应用提供新思路。

Abstract: Enhancing reasoning capabilities in small language models is critical for
specialized applications such as medical question answering, particularly in
underrepresented languages like Persian. In this study, we employ Reinforcement
Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) and Direct preference optimization (DPO) to
improve the reasoning skills of a general-purpose Persian language model. To
achieve this, we translated a multiple-choice medical question-answering
dataset into Persian and used RLAIF to generate rejected-preferred answer
pairs, which are essential for DPO training. By prompting both teacher and
student models to produce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning responses, we
compiled a dataset containing correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories.
This dataset, comprising 2 million tokens in preferred answers and 2.5 million
tokens in rejected ones, was used to train a baseline model, significantly
enhancing its medical reasoning capabilities in Persian. Remarkably, the
resulting model outperformed its predecessor, gaokerena-V, which was trained on
approximately 57 million tokens, despite leveraging a much smaller dataset.
These results highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of reasoning-focused
training approaches in developing domain-specific language models with limited
data availability.

Motivation: 现有LLM创造力评估方法零散且存在定义分歧，需要统一框架跨领域测量创造力不同维度。

Method: 构建包含3维度（质量/新颖性/多样性）、3领域（发散思维/创意写作/逻辑推理）和20个指标的评估体系，测试17个前沿LLM。

Result: 专有模型整体优于开源模型；同领域任务表现高度相关，跨领域相关性弱；质量与多样性强相关，新颖性独立变化。

Conclusion: LLM创造力评估需多维度覆盖，单维度/单领域表现无法代表整体创造力水平，强调全面评估框架的必要性。

Abstract: Creativity is often seen as a hallmark of human intelligence. While large
language models (LLMs) are increasingly perceived as producing creative text,
there is still no holistic framework to evaluate their creativity across
diverse scenarios. Existing evaluation methods remain fragmented, with dramatic
variation across domains and tasks, largely due to differing definitions and
measurements of creativity. Inspired by the hypothesis that creativity is not
one fixed idea, we propose CreativityPrism, an evaluation analysis framework
that decomposes creativity into three dimensions: quality, novelty, and
diversity. CreativityPrism incorporates nine tasks, three domains, i.e.,
divergent thinking, creative writing, and logical reasoning, and twenty
evaluation metrics, which measure each dimension in task-specific, unique ways.
We evaluate 17 state-of-the-art (SoTA) proprietary and open-sourced LLMs on
CreativityPrism and analyze the performance correlations among different
metrics and task domains. Our results reveal a notable gap between proprietary
and open-source models. Overall, model performance tends to be highly
correlated across tasks within the same domain and less so across different
domains. Among evaluation dimensions, diversity and quality metrics show strong
correlations - models that perform well on one often excel on the other -
whereas novelty exhibits much weaker correlation with either. These findings
support our hypothesis that strong performance in one creativity task or
dimension does not necessarily generalize to others, underscoring the need for
a holistic evaluation of LLM creativity.

Motivation: 传统实体链接方法依赖大量标注数据和模型微调，而现有少样本方法虽然使用大语言模型(LLM)提示但效率低下

Method: 构建包含候选生成、上下文评分、自适应路由和选择性推理的混合架构，通过互补信号区分难易案例分别处理

Result: 在6个数据集中5个实现平均+2.53%提升，推理效率达到全LLM方法的两倍

Conclusion: ARTER在保持高性能的同时显著优化计算效率，为少样本实体链接提供了新的技术路径

Abstract: Entity Linking (EL) has traditionally relied on large annotated datasets and
extensive model fine-tuning. While recent few-shot methods leverage large
language models (LLMs) through prompting to reduce training requirements, they
often suffer from inefficiencies due to expensive LLM-based reasoning. ARTER
(Adaptive Routing and Targeted Entity Reasoning) presents a structured pipeline
that achieves high performance without deep fine-tuning by strategically
combining candidate generation, context-based scoring, adaptive routing, and
selective reasoning. ARTER computes a small set of complementary signals(both
embedding and LLM-based) over the retrieved candidates to categorize contextual
mentions into easy and hard cases. The cases are then handled by a
low-computational entity linker (e.g. ReFinED) and more expensive targeted
LLM-based reasoning respectively. On standard benchmarks, ARTER outperforms
ReFinED by up to +4.47%, with an average gain of +2.53% on 5 out of 6 datasets,
and performs comparably to pipelines using LLM-based reasoning for all
mentions, while being as twice as efficient in terms of the number of LLM
tokens.

Motivation: 传统基于段落的分割方法难以处理含表格/代码等复杂结构的文本，需开发能降低推理成本并减少幻觉的高效分割方案。

Method: 1. 仅生成起始标记并在原文本定位  2. 设计RLVR奖励机制优化重构保真度与语义对齐  3. 通过扰动生成序列构建中间候选防止熵崩溃

Result: 1.7B小模型效果优于大模型少样本学习  RLVR比监督学习提升明显  中间候选策略使F1提升2.3%且泛化性更好

Conclusion: BoundRL为复杂结构化文本（如LLM提示）提供高效分割方案，验证了强化学习奖励与候选扰动策略的有效性。

Abstract: As structured texts become increasingly complex across diverse domains --
from technical reports to generative AI prompts -- the need for text
segmentation into semantically meaningful components becomes critical. Such
texts often contain elements beyond plain language, including tables, code
snippets, and placeholders, which conventional sentence- or paragraph-level
segmentation methods cannot handle effectively. To address this challenge, we
propose BoundRL, a novel and efficient approach that jointly performs
token-level text segmentation and label prediction for long structured texts.
Instead of generating complete contents for each segment, it generates only a
sequence of starting tokens and reconstructs the complete contents by locating
these tokens within the original texts, thereby reducing inference costs by
orders of magnitude and minimizing hallucination. To adapt the model for the
output format, BoundRL~performs reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards
(RLVR) with a specifically designed reward that jointly optimizes document
reconstruction fidelity and semantic alignment. To mitigate entropy collapse,
it further constructs intermediate candidates by systematically perturbing a
fraction of generated sequences of segments to create stepping stones toward
higher-quality solutions. To demonstrate BoundRL's effectiveness on
particularly challenging structured texts, we focus evaluation on complex
prompts used for LLM applications. Experiments show that BoundRL enables small
language models (1.7B parameters) to outperform few-shot prompting of much
larger models. Moreover, RLVR with our designed reward yields significant
improvements over supervised fine-tuning, and incorporating intermediate
candidates further improves both performance and generalization.

Motivation: 立场检测作为涉及政治倾向的敏感NLP任务，其模型偏见评估长期被忽视。研究旨在揭示大语言模型在零样本设置下的立场检测偏见模式

Method: 通过自动化标注现有数据集的文本属性（特定群体方言和文本复杂度），分析这些属性对模型立场判断的影响

Result: LLMs表现出系统性偏见：低文本复杂度文本被误判为支持大麻，非洲裔美国方言文本被错误关联到反对特朗普立场

Conclusion: 研究证实大语言模型继承训练数据中的社会刻板印象，在立场检测中产生系统性偏见，强调开发去偏技术的必要性

Abstract: Large Language Models inherit stereotypes from their pretraining data,
leading to biased behavior toward certain social groups in many Natural
Language Processing tasks, such as hateful speech detection or sentiment
analysis. Surprisingly, the evaluation of this kind of bias in stance detection
methods has been largely overlooked by the community. Stance Detection involves
labeling a statement as being against, in favor, or neutral towards a specific
target and is among the most sensitive NLP tasks, as it often relates to
political leanings. In this paper, we focus on the bias of Large Language
Models when performing stance detection in a zero-shot setting. We
automatically annotate posts in pre-existing stance detection datasets with two
attributes: dialect or vernacular of a specific group and text
complexity/readability, to investigate whether these attributes influence the
model's stance detection decisions. Our results show that LLMs exhibit
significant stereotypes in stance detection tasks, such as incorrectly
associating pro-marijuana views with low text complexity and African American
dialect with opposition to Donald Trump.

Result: 最先进代理平均成功率仅2.39%，识别出反思缺失、知识依赖过度、检索不足、上下文溢出四大失败模式

Conclusion: 公开基准DeepWideSearch将推动开发具备深度推理与广域信息处理能力的鲁棒性代理系统

Abstract: Current search agents fundamentally lack the ability to simultaneously
perform \textit{deep} reasoning over multi-hop retrieval and
\textit{wide}-scale information collection-a critical deficiency for real-world
applications like comprehensive market analysis and business development. To
bridge this gap, we introduce DeepWideSearch, the first benchmark explicitly
designed to evaluate agents to integrate depth and width in information
seeking. In DeepWideSearch, agents must process a large volume of data, each
requiring deep reasoning over multi-hop retrieval paths. Specifically, we
propose two methods to converse established datasets, resulting in a curated
collection of 220 questions spanning 15 diverse domains. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that even state-of-the-art agents achieve only 2.39% average
success rate on DeepWideSearch, highlighting the substantial challenge of
integrating depth and width search in information-seeking tasks. Furthermore,
our error analysis reveals four failure modes: lack of reflection, overreliance
on internal knowledge, insufficient retrieval, and context overflow-exposing
key limitations in current agent architectures. We publicly release
DeepWideSearch to catalyze future research on more capable and robust
information-seeking agents.

Conclusion: 验证了多智能体框架与强化学习结合在表格理解任务中的有效性，展示了结构化工作流与代码执行的协同优势

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over tables is a critical capability for many
real-world applications. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise on
this task, but current approaches remain limited. Fine-tuning based methods
strengthen language reasoning; yet they are prone to arithmetic errors and
hallucination. In contrast, tool-based methods enable precise table
manipulation but rely on rigid schemas and lack semantic understanding. These
complementary drawbacks highlight the need for approaches that integrate robust
reasoning with reliable table processing. In this work, we propose
Mixture-of-Minds, a multi-agent framework that decomposes table reasoning into
three specialized roles: planning, coding, and answering. This design enables
each agent to focus on a specific aspect of the task while leveraging code
execution for precise table manipulation. Building on this workflow, we
introduce a self-improvement training framework that employs Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) rollouts to generate pseudo-gold trajectories and optimize agents
with reinforcement learning (RL). Extensive experiments show that
Mixture-of-Minds delivers substantial gains, reaching 62.13% on TableBench and
surpassing OpenAI-o4-mini-high. These results demonstrate the promise of
combining structured multi-agent workflows with RL to advance table
understanding.

Conclusion: 语言模型的文本空间推理能力与几何计算存在显著鸿沟，需开发融合语言与空间表征的新型评估体系

Abstract: This paper explores the spatial reasoning capability of large language models
(LLMs) over textual input through a suite of five tasks aimed at probing their
spatial understanding and computational abilities. The models were tested on
both fundamental spatial reasoning and multi-step problem-solving within
structured grid-based environments using tasks such as quadrant identification,
geometric transformations, distance evaluation, word searches, and tile
sliding. Each task was scaled in complexity through increasing grid dimensions,
requiring models to extend beyond simple pattern recognition into abstract
spatial reasoning. Our results reveal that while LLMs demonstrate moderate
success in all tasks with small complexity and size, performance drops off
rapidly as scale increases, with an average loss in accuracy of 42.7%, and
reaching as high as 84%. Every test that began with over 50% accuracy showed a
loss of at least 48%, illustrating the consistent nature of the deterioration.
Furthermore, their struggles with scaling complexity hint at a lack of robust
spatial representations in their underlying architectures. This paper
underscores the gap between linguistic and spatial reasoning in LLMs, offering
insights into their current limitations, and laying the groundwork for future
integrative benchmarks at the intersection of language and geometry.

Result: 在多个开源模型上验证，该方法以极低计算成本获得足够精确的边际概率估计。

Conclusion: 解码无关采样为语言模型概率边际化评估提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Modern language models operate on subword-tokenized text in order to make a
trade-off between model size, inference speed, and vocabulary coverage. A side
effect of this is that, during inference, models are evaluated by measuring the
probability of only the specific tokenization produced as the output, despite
there being many possible ways to represent the same text with a subword
vocabulary. Recent studies have argued instead for evaluating LLMs by
marginalization - the probability mass of all tokenizations of a given text.
  Marginalization is difficult due to the number of possible tokenizations of a
text, so often approximate marginalization is done via sampling. However, a
downside of sampling is that an expensive generation step must be performed by
the LLM for each sample, which limits the number of samples that can be
acquired given a runtime budget, and therefore also the accuracy of the
approximation. Since computing the probability of a sequence given the
tokenization is relatively cheap compared to actually generating it, we
investigate sampling strategies that are decoding-free - they require no
generation from the LLM, instead relying entirely on extremely cheap sampling
strategies that are model and tokenizer agnostic.
  We investigate the approximation quality and speed of decoding-free sampling
strategies for a number of open models to find that they provide sufficiently
accurate marginal estimates at a small fraction of the runtime cost and
demonstrate its use on a set of downstream inference tasks.

Conclusion: 该框架实现可重复的多障碍共病评估，通过特征归因提供临床决策支持，在模态缺失时仍保持可靠判断，推进情感计算在真实临床场景的应用。

Abstract: Depression and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) often co-occur with
connected symptoms, complicating automated assessment, which is often binary
and disorder specific. Clinically useful diagnosis needs severity aware cross
disorder estimates and decision support explanations. Our unified tri modal
affective severity framework synchronizes and fuses interview text with
sentence level transformer embeddings, audio with log Mel statistics with
deltas, and facial signals with action units, gaze, head and pose descriptors
to output graded severities for diagnosing both depression (PHQ-8; 5 classes)
and PTSD (3 classes). Standardized features are fused via a calibrated late
fusion classifier, yielding per disorder probabilities and feature-level
attributions. This severity aware tri-modal affective fusion approach is demoed
on multi disorder concurrent depression and PTSD assessment. Stratified cross
validation on DAIC derived corpora outperforms unimodal/ablation baselines. The
fused model matches the strongest unimodal baseline on accuracy and weighted
F1, while improving decision curve utility and robustness under noisy or
missing modalities. For PTSD specifically, fusion reduces regression error and
improves class concordance. Errors cluster between adjacent severities; extreme
classes are identified reliably. Ablations show text contributes most to
depression severity, audio and facial cues are critical for PTSD, whereas
attributions align with linguistic and behavioral markers. Our approach offers
reproducible evaluation and clinician in the loop support for affective
clinical decision making.

Result: 在1.5B参数的GPT2/Pythia模型上实现困惑度降低和下游任务性能提升，计算开销最小化

Conclusion: next-context预测提供了一种高效可扩展的增强方案，显著改善长程连贯性和注意力分配效果

Abstract: Next-token prediction (NTP) is the cornerstone of modern large language
models (LLMs) pretraining, driving their unprecedented capabilities in text
generation, reasoning, and instruction following. However, the token-level
prediction limits the model's capacity to capture higher-level semantic
structures and long-range contextual relationships. To overcome this
limitation, we introduce \textbf{ContextLM}, a framework that augments standard
pretraining with an inherent \textbf{next-context prediction} objective. This
mechanism trains the model to learn predictive representations of multi-token
contexts, leveraging error signals derived from future token chunks. Crucially,
ContextLM achieves this enhancement while remaining fully compatible with the
standard autoregressive, token-by-token evaluation paradigm (e.g., perplexity).
Extensive experiments on the GPT2 and Pythia model families, scaled up to
$1.5$B parameters, show that ContextLM delivers consistent improvements in both
perplexity and downstream task performance. Our analysis indicates that
next-context prediction provides a scalable and efficient pathway to stronger
language modeling, yielding better long-range coherence and more effective
attention allocation with minimal computational overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM检索增强生成（RAG）系统存在引用不完整问题，特别是当回答正确但证据引用缺失时会影响可信度。需要明确区分引用失败和回答错误，并针对性改进引用机制。

Conclusion: 明确区分引用失败类型有助于精准改进，多方法融合可有效提升引用质量。开源代码和数据推动相关研究。

Abstract: Citations from LLM-based RAG systems are supposed to simplify response
verification. However, this does not hold for citation failure, when a model
generates a helpful response, but fails to cite complete evidence. In contrast
to previous work, we propose to disentangle this from response failure, where
the response itself is flawed, and citing complete evidence is impossible. To
address citation failure, this work follows a two-step approach: (1) We study
when citation failure occurs and (2) how it can be mitigated. For step 1, we
extend prior work by investigating how the relation between response and
evidence affects citation quality. We introduce CITECONTROL, a benchmark that
systematically varies this relation to analyze failure modes. Experiments show
that failures increase with relational complexity and suggest that combining
citation methods could improve performance, motivating step 2. To improve LLM
citation efficiently, we propose CITENTION, a framework integrating generative,
attention-based, and retrieval-based methods. Results demonstrate substantial
citation improvements on CITECONTROL and in transfer settings. We make our data
and code publicly available.

TL;DR: 首个针对表格问答的PRM系统性研究，发现现有模型在跨域泛化能力和步骤验证-答案准确性关联性方面存在显著局限


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索过程奖励模型在表格问答领域的适用性，该任务具有半结构化数据、无关信息干扰、松散推理步骤依赖等独特挑战

Method: 通过文本验证与代码验证结合的PRM方法，从答案准确性和步骤验证两个维度评估模型在表格问答任务上的表现

Result: 组合验证方法能提升方案选择，但跨域泛化能力弱；步骤验证表现与答案准确性相关性低（可能源于弱步骤依赖和松散因果关系）

Conclusion: 揭示了当前PRM在表格问答中的局限性，为构建更鲁棒的过程感知验证器提供了关键洞见

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) improve complex reasoning in large language
models (LLMs) by grading candidate solutions step-by-step and selecting answers
via aggregated step scores. While effective in domains such as mathematics,
their applicability to tasks involving semi-structured data, like table
question answering (TQA) remains unexplored. TQA poses unique challenges for
PRMs, including abundant irrelevant information, loosely connected reasoning
steps, and domain-specific reasoning. This work presents the first systematic
study of PRMs for TQA. We evaluate state-of-the-art generative PRMs on TQA from
both answer and step perspectives. Results show that PRMs that combine textual
and code verification can aid solution selection but struggle to generalize to
out-of-domain data. Analysis reveals a weak correlation between performance in
step-level verification and answer accuracy, possibly stemming from weak step
dependencies and loose causal links. Our findings highlight limitations of
current PRMs on TQA and offer valuable insights for building more robust,
process-aware verifiers.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) like OpenAI-o1 have shown impressive
capabilities in natural language reasoning. However, these models frequently
demonstrate inefficiencies or inaccuracies when tackling complex mathematical
operations. While integrating computational tools such as Code Interpreters
(CIs) offers a promising solution, it introduces a critical challenge: a
conflict between the model's internal, probabilistic reasoning and the
external, deterministic knowledge provided by the CI, which often leads models
to unproductive deliberation. To overcome this, we introduce CoRT
(Code-Optimized Reasoning Training), a post-training framework designed to
teach LRMs to effectively utilize CIs. We propose \emph{Hint-Engineering}, a
new data synthesis strategy that strategically injects diverse hints at optimal
points within reasoning paths. This approach generates high-quality,
code-integrated reasoning data specifically tailored to optimize LRM-CI
interaction. Using this method, we have synthesized 30 high-quality samples to
post-train models ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters through supervised
fine-tuning. CoRT further refines the multi-round interleaving of external CI
usage and internal thinking by employing rejection sampling and reinforcement
learning. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate CoRT's effectiveness,
yielding absolute improvements of 4\% and 8\% on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B
and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, respectively, across five challenging
mathematical reasoning datasets. Moreover, CoRT significantly enhances
efficiency, reducing token usage by approximately 30\% for the 32B model and
50\% for the 1.5B model compared to pure natural language reasoning baselines.

TL;DR: LLMs在表格推理任务中的表现可能源于对公开数据集的记忆而非真实推理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在结构化数据推理能力时存在数据集污染盲区，需验证其是否依赖语义线索而非真实推理

Method: 通过控制变量实验（保留/随机化语义线索）测试LLMs在多个表格基准上的表现差异

Result: 当去除语义线索时模型性能骤降至随机水平，显示其依赖数据集表层特征而非深层推理

Conclusion: 需改进评估协议以区分语义泄漏与真实推理能力，建议采用去语义化测试集验证模型泛化性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on their ability to
reason over structured data, yet such assessments often overlook a crucial
confound: dataset contamination. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs
exhibit prior knowledge of widely used tabular benchmarks such as Adult Income,
Titanic, and others. Through a series of controlled probing experiments, we
reveal that contamination effects emerge exclusively for datasets containing
strong semantic cues-for instance, meaningful column names or interpretable
value categories. In contrast, when such cues are removed or randomized,
performance sharply declines to near-random levels. These findings suggest that
LLMs' apparent competence on tabular reasoning tasks may, in part, reflect
memorization of publicly available datasets rather than genuine generalization.
We discuss implications for evaluation protocols and propose strategies to
disentangle semantic leakage from authentic reasoning ability in future LLM
assessments.

Motivation: 传统固定粒度的分块方法依赖静态边界识别，难以适应多样化查询需求，限制了检索增强生成系统的适应性

Method: 建立以句子为原子单位的编码框架，通过动态组合策略取代静态分块，支持任意句子组合的跨粒度检索

Result: 在LongBench V2上的实验显示，FreeChunker检索性能优于传统分块方法，计算效率提升显著

Conclusion: 范式转换的跨粒度编码框架既降低语义边界检测计算成本，又增强对复杂查询的适应能力，推动RAG系统进化

Abstract: Chunking strategies significantly impact the effectiveness of
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Existing methods operate within
fixed-granularity paradigms that rely on static boundary identification,
limiting their adaptability to diverse query requirements. This paper presents
FreeChunker, a Cross-Granularity Encoding Framework that fundamentally
transforms the traditional chunking paradigm: the framework treats sentences as
atomic units and shifts from static chunk segmentation to flexible retrieval
supporting arbitrary sentence combinations. This paradigm shift not only
significantly reduces the computational overhead required for semantic boundary
detection but also enhances adaptability to complex queries. Experimental
evaluation on LongBench V2 demonstrates that FreeChunker achieves superior
retrieval performance compared to traditional chunking methods, while
significantly outperforming existing approaches in computational efficiency.

Abstract: We investigate whether pre-training exclusively on dialogue data results in

Conclusion: 现有LLM架构需针对性改进以应对否定表达带来的特殊挑战，提示需要新的解释性框架。

Abstract: Recent studies on hallucination in large language models (LLMs) have been
actively progressing in natural language processing. However, the impact of
negated text on hallucination with LLMs remains largely unexplored. In this
paper, we set three important yet unanswered research questions and aim to
address them. To derive the answers, we investigate whether LLMs can recognize
contextual shifts caused by negation and still reliably distinguish
hallucinations comparable to affirmative cases. We also design the NegHalu
dataset by reconstructing existing hallucination detection datasets with
negated expressions. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs struggle to detect
hallucinations in negated text effectively, often producing logically
inconsistent or unfaithful judgments. Moreover, we trace the internal state of
LLMs as they process negated inputs at the token level and reveal the
challenges of mitigating their unintended effects.

Abstract: Since their initial release, BERT models have demonstrated exceptional
performance on a variety of tasks, despite their relatively small size
(BERT-base has ~100M parameters). Nevertheless, the architectural choices used
in these models are outdated compared to newer transformer-based models such as
Llama3 and Qwen3. In recent months, several architectures have been proposed to
close this gap. ModernBERT and NeoBERT both show strong improvements on English
benchmarks and significantly extend the supported context window. Following
their successes, we introduce NeoDictaBERT and NeoDictaBERT-bilingual:
BERT-style models trained using the same architecture as NeoBERT, with a
dedicated focus on Hebrew texts. These models outperform existing ones on
almost all Hebrew benchmarks and provide a strong foundation for downstream
tasks. Notably, the NeoDictaBERT-bilingual model shows strong results on
retrieval tasks, outperforming other multilingual models of similar size. In
this paper, we describe the training process and report results across various
benchmarks. We release the models to the community as part of our goal to
advance research and development in Hebrew NLP.

Motivation: 解决BabyLM在多轮对话中难以保持连续性（即及时、直接、有意义交互）的核心挑战，通过后训练提升对话质量

Method: 1. 构建教师-学生框架 2. 使用新型对齐数据集进行后训练 3. 尝试自适应教师解码策略（效果有限）

Result: 语法正确性提升21%，对话连贯性改善17%，但自适应策略仅带来3%额外增益，显示连续性仍是BabyLM的技术瓶颈

Conclusion: 针对性后训练有效提升对话质量，但完全实现人类水平的对话连续性需要更深入的架构创新，当前BabyLM仍存在显著技术鸿沟

Abstract: Multi-turn dialogues between a child and a caregiver are characterized by a
property called contingency - that is, prompt, direct, and meaningful exchanges
between interlocutors. We introduce ContingentChat, a teacher-student framework
that benchmarks and improves multi-turn contingency in a BabyLM trained on 100M
words. Using a novel alignment dataset for post-training, BabyLM generates
responses that are more grammatical and cohesive. Experiments with adaptive
teacher decoding strategies show limited additional gains. ContingentChat
demonstrates the benefits of targeted post-training for dialogue quality and
indicates that contingency remains a challenging goal for BabyLMs.

Method: 构建144K样本的MIXTURE数据集，开发LM-Mixup框架：先监督微调，再通过GRPO强化学习融合质量/语义/格式三重奖励信号。

Result: 蒸馏后的3%数据微调效果超越全量训练，在多个基准测试中媲美SOTA高质量数据筛选方法，验证低质量数据利用价值。

Conclusion: 通过LM-Mixup有效蒸馏低质量数据，显著提升LLM指令微调效率，证明低质量数据是待开发的宝贵资源。

Abstract: Instruction tuning is crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs), yet
the quality of instruction-following data varies significantly. While
high-quality data is paramount, it is often scarce; conversely, abundant
low-quality data is frequently discarded, leading to substantial information
loss. Existing data augmentation methods struggle to augment this low-quality
data effectively, and the evaluation of such techniques remains poorly defined.
To address this, we formally define the task of Instruction Distillation:
distilling multiple low-quality and redundant inputs into high-quality and
coherent instruction-output pairs. Specifically, we introduce a comprehensive
data construction pipeline to create MIXTURE, a 144K-sample dataset pairing
low-quality or semantically redundant imperfect instruction clusters with their
high-quality distillations. We then introduce LM-Mixup, by first performing
supervised fine-tuning on MIXTURE and then optimizing it with reinforcement
learning. This process uses three complementary reward signals: quality,
semantic alignment, and format compliance, via Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). We demonstrate that LM-Mixup effectively augments
imperfect datasets: fine-tuning LLMs on its distilled data, which accounts for
only about 3% of the entire dataset, not only surpasses full-dataset training
but also competes with state-of-the-art high-quality data selection methods
across multiple benchmarks. Our work establishes that low-quality data is a
valuable resource when properly distilled and augmented with LM-Mixup,
significantly enhancing the efficiency and performance of instruction-tuned
LLMs.

TL;DR: Evaluated four confidence estimation methods for LLM outputs, finding CoCoA hybrid approach most reliable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM outputs exhibit variability in uncertainty and correctness, necessitating robust confidence metrics for practical reliability.

Method: Tested VCE, MSP, Sample Consistency, and CoCoA on four QA tasks using a state-of-the-art open-source LLM.

Result: CoCoA demonstrated superior reliability with improved calibration (15% better) and discrimination (20% higher AUC-ROC).

Conclusion: Hybrid approaches like CoCoA offer optimal balance, though method choice should align with specific application requirements.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) produce outputs with varying levels of
uncertainty, and, just as often, varying levels of correctness; making their
practical reliability far from guaranteed. To quantify this uncertainty, we
systematically evaluate four approaches for confidence estimation in LLM
outputs: VCE, MSP, Sample Consistency, and CoCoA (Vashurin et al., 2025). For
the evaluation of the approaches, we conduct experiments on four
question-answering tasks using a state-of-the-art open-source LLM. Our results
show that each uncertainty metric captures a different facet of model
confidence and that the hybrid CoCoA approach yields the best reliability
overall, improving both calibration and discrimination of correct answers. We
discuss the trade-offs of each method and provide recommendations for selecting
uncertainty measures in LLM applications.

Result: 在5个NLP任务中持续学习效果优于基线，实现多领域无缝整合，保持知识保留与泛化能力的平衡。

Conclusion: RECALL为LLM持续进化提供了可扩展的无数据解决方案，突破了传统方法对任务标签和数据存储的依赖。

Abstract: We unveil that internal representations in large language models (LLMs) serve
as reliable proxies of learned knowledge, and propose RECALL, a novel
representation-aware model merging framework for continual learning without
access to historical data. RECALL computes inter-model similarity from
layer-wise hidden representations over clustered typical samples, and performs
adaptive, hierarchical parameter fusion to align knowledge across models. This
design enables the preservation of domain-general features in shallow layers
while allowing task-specific adaptation in deeper layers. Unlike prior methods
that require task labels or incur performance trade-offs, RECALL achieves
seamless multi-domain integration and strong resistance to catastrophic
forgetting. Extensive experiments across five NLP tasks and multiple continual
learning scenarios show that RECALL outperforms baselines in both knowledge
retention and generalization, providing a scalable and data-free solution for
evolving LLMs.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在安全评估中因识别评估场景而调整行为导致的可靠性问题

Method: 采用两步训练流程：1）持续预训练使模型识别评估线索 2）专家迭代训练使用Python类型提示，最终通过激活向量引导抑制评估意识

Result: 激活引导技术成功消除了评估环境与部署环境之间的行为差异，即使存在评估线索也能保持部署状态行为模式

Conclusion: 该方法为提升AI安全评估可靠性提供了新思路，证明模型行为引导可有效解决评估场景识别带来的偏差问题

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can sometimes detect when they are being
evaluated and adjust their behavior to appear more aligned, compromising the
reliability of safety evaluations. In this paper, we show that adding a
steering vector to an LLM's activations can suppress evaluation-awareness and
make the model act like it is deployed during evaluation. To study our steering
technique, we train an LLM to exhibit evaluation-aware behavior using a
two-step training process designed to mimic how this behavior could emerge
naturally. First, we perform continued pretraining on documents with factual
descriptions of the model (1) using Python type hints during evaluation but not
during deployment and (2) recognizing that the presence of a certain evaluation
cue always means that it is being tested. Then, we train the model with expert
iteration to use Python type hints in evaluation settings. The resulting model
is evaluation-aware: it writes type hints in evaluation contexts more than
deployment contexts. However, this gap can only be observed by removing the
evaluation cue. We find that activation steering can suppress evaluation
awareness and make the model act like it is deployed even when the cue is
present. Importantly, we constructed our steering vector using the original
model before our additional training. Our results suggest that AI evaluators
could improve the reliability of safety evaluations by steering models to act
like they are deployed.

Conclusion: RPS为偏好对齐模型提供了理论可靠且无需重训练的实际解决方案，有效扩展了偏好覆盖范围。

Abstract: Aligning large language models with human preferences is critical for
creating reliable and controllable AI systems. A human preference can be
visualized as a high-dimensional vector where different directions represent
trade-offs between desired attributes (e.g., helpfulness vs. verbosity). Yet,
because the training data often reflects dominant, average preferences, LLMs
tend to perform well on common requests but fall short in specific, individual
needs. This mismatch creates a preference coverage gap. Existing methods often
address this through costly retraining, which may not be generalized to the
full spectrum of diverse preferences. This brittleness means that when a user's
request reflects a nuanced preference deviating from the training data's
central tendency, model performance can degrade unpredictably. To address this
challenge, we introduce Robust Preference Selection (RPS), a post-hoc,
training-free method by leveraging directional neighborhood consensus. Instead
of forcing a model to generate a response from a single, highly specific
preference, RPS samples multiple responses from a local neighborhood of related
preferences to create a superior candidate pool. It then selects the response
that best aligns with the user's original intent. We provide a theoretical
framework showing our neighborhood generation strategy is provably superior to
a strong baseline that also samples multiple candidates. Comprehensive
experiments across three distinct alignment paradigms (DPA, DPO, and SFT)
demonstrate that RPS consistently improves robustness against this baseline,
achieving win rates of up to 69% on challenging preferences from
under-represented regions of the space without any model retraining. Our work
presents a practical, theoretically-grounded solution for enhancing the
reliability of preference-aligned models.

Method: 1) 将文档/表格/知识图谱线性化为可逆分层序列(HSeq) 2) 通过双代理机制（指导代理+迭代代理）进行结构感知的检索扩展，支持跨父节点/子节点/表格行列/KG关系跳转 3) 证据规范化与矛盾检测的答案合成机制。

Result: 在HotpotQA(文本)、HybridQA/TAT-QA(表格+文本)、MetaQA(KG)上EM/F1全面超越基线，同时实现：单策略跨模态处理、检索跳转减少40%、推理token节省35%。

Conclusion: HSEQ的三大优势：1) 格式无关的统一处理框架 2) 预算感知的智能迭代机制 3) 证据规范化提升答案可审计性，为复杂QA系统提供新的架构范式。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) remains brittle on multi-step questions
and heterogeneous evidence sources, trading accuracy against latency and
token/tool budgets. This paper introducesHierarchical Sequence (HSEQ) Iteration
for Heterogeneous Question Answering, a unified framework that (i) linearize
documents, tables, and knowledge graphs into a reversible hierarchical sequence
with lightweight structural tags, and (ii) perform structure-aware iteration to
collect just-enough evidence before answer synthesis. A Head Agent provides
guidance that leads retrieval, while an Iteration Agent selects and expands
HSeq via structure-respecting actions (e.g., parent/child hops, table
row/column neighbors, KG relations); Finally the head agent composes
canonicalized evidence to genearte the final answer, with an optional
refinement loop to resolve detected contradictions. Experiments on HotpotQA
(text), HybridQA/TAT-QA (table+text), and MetaQA (KG) show consistent EM/F1
gains over strong single-pass, multi-hop, and agentic RAG baselines with high
efficiency. Besides, HSEQ exhibits three key advantages: (1) a format-agnostic
unification that enables a single policy to operate across text, tables, and
KGs without per-dataset specialization; (2) guided, budget-aware iteration that
reduces unnecessary hops, tool calls, and tokens while preserving accuracy; and
(3) evidence canonicalization for reliable QA, improving answers consistency
and auditability.

*Paul Lerner,François Yvon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过欧洲议会多语言语料库分析发现，主流政党演讲的翻译质量优于边缘政党，揭示了LLMs存在政治偏见


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM政治偏见评估主要依赖英语问卷模拟，本研究提出通过多语言翻译公平性原则揭示不同政党间的系统性差异

Method: 利用包含政治背景信息的21种语言EuroParl数据集（150万句子），系统比较欧洲议会不同政党演讲的翻译质量

Result: 左翼/中间/右翼主流政党的翻译准确性显著高于非主流政党，显示LLM存在与政治地位相关的翻译偏差

Conclusion: 翻译质量差异反映了LLMs潜在的政治偏见，需建立跨语言公平性评估框架来提升边缘群体的技术包容性

Abstract: The political biases of Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually assessed by
simulating their answers to English surveys. In this work, we propose an
alternative framing of political biases, relying on principles of fairness in
multilingual translation. We systematically compare the translation quality of
speeches in the European Parliament (EP), observing systematic differences with
majority parties from left, center, and right being better translated than
outsider parties. This study is made possible by a new, 21-way multiparallel
version of EuroParl, the parliamentary proceedings of the EP, which includes
the political affiliations of each speaker. The dataset consists of 1.5M
sentences for a total of 40M words and 249M characters. It covers three years,
1000+ speakers, 7 countries, 12 EU parties, 25 EU committees, and hundreds of
national parties.

*Hippolyte Pilchen,Edouard Grave,Patrick Pérez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出ARC-Encoder：通过连续表征压缩上下文，减少解码器LLM的token嵌入量4-8倍，保持多场景性能的同时提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长上下文场景下推理成本高的问题，避免传统压缩方法需微调模型或修改架构导致的通用能力下降。

Method: 设计可适配编码器，通过系统研究训练策略和架构选择，将文本压缩为低维连续表征替换原token嵌入。

Result: 在多个基准测试实现SOTA，计算效率提升，且单编码器可适配不同解码器LLM。

Conclusion: ARC-Encoder为跨模型通用的上下文压缩提供了灵活高效的解决方案，支持多LLM的无缝集成。

Abstract: Recent techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation or chain-of-thought
reasoning have led to longer contexts and increased inference costs. Context
compression techniques can reduce these costs, but the most effective
approaches require fine-tuning the target model or even modifying its
architecture. This can degrade its general abilities when not used for this
specific purpose. Here we explore an alternative approach: an encoder that
compresses the context into continuous representations which replace token
embeddings in decoder LLMs. First, we perform a systematic study of training
strategies and architecture choices for the encoder. Our findings led to the
design of an Adaptable text Representations Compressor, named ARC-Encoder,
which outputs $x$-times fewer continuous representations (typically
$x\!\in\!\{4,8\}$) than text tokens. We evaluate ARC-Encoder across a variety
of LLM usage scenarios, ranging from in-context learning to context window
extension, on both instruct and base decoders. Results show that ARC-Encoder
achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks while improving
computational efficiency at inference. Finally, we demonstrate that our models
can be adapted to multiple decoders simultaneously, allowing a single encoder
to generalize across different decoder LLMs. This makes ARC-Encoder a flexible
and efficient solution for portable encoders that work seamlessly with multiple
LLMs. We release a training code at https://github.com/kyutai-labs/ARC-Encoder

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究开发CenterBench数据集量化语言模型从结构分析转向语义模式匹配的临界点，揭示模型在嵌套句处理中随复杂度加深逐渐依赖语义关联的现象


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试无法区分语言模型对句子的结构理解与语义模式匹配行为，需建立新评估框架量化模型结构分析能力边界

Method: 创建包含9,720个中心嵌套句问题的数据集，通过句法相同但语义合理/不合理对比句，测试6个模型在表层理解、句法依赖和因果推理的表现

Result: 模型在合理/不合理句子的表现差距随复杂度系统化扩大（中位差达26.8%），语义合理性反而损害行动类问题表现，推理模型存在语义捷径和过度思考现象

Conclusion: CenterBench首次提供量化模型结构分析能力边界的框架，证明语义合理性优势随复杂度系统化扩展是模型特征，与人类多变的语义效应形成对比

Abstract: When language models correctly parse "The cat that the dog chased meowed,"
are they analyzing syntax or simply familiar with dogs chasing cats? Despite
extensive benchmarking, we lack methods to distinguish structural understanding
from semantic pattern matching. We introduce CenterBench, a dataset of 9,720
comprehension questions on center-embedded sentences (like "The cat [that the
dog chased] meowed") where relative clauses nest recursively, creating
processing demands from simple to deeply nested structures. Each sentence has a
syntactically identical but semantically implausible counterpart (e.g., mailmen
prescribe medicine, doctors deliver mail) and six comprehension questions
testing surface understanding, syntactic dependencies, and causal reasoning.
Testing six models reveals that performance gaps between plausible and
implausible sentences widen systematically with complexity, with models showing
median gaps up to 26.8 percentage points, quantifying when they abandon
structural analysis for semantic associations. Notably, semantic plausibility
harms performance on questions about resulting actions, where following causal
relationships matters more than semantic coherence. Reasoning models improve
accuracy but their traces show semantic shortcuts, overthinking, and answer
refusal. Unlike models whose plausibility advantage systematically widens with
complexity, humans shows variable semantic effects. CenterBench provides the
first framework to identify when models shift from structural analysis to
pattern matching.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索增强生成方法在多跳问答中存在全局规划能力不足（无法结构化多步推理）和执行不忠实（检索查询构建不完善、证据使用不一致）两大核心限制

Method: 1. 问题分解为子目标形成推理链
2. 规划质量奖励机制确保逻辑连贯性
3. 子目标完成奖励机制保障可靠执行
4. 渐进式权重退火策略平衡过程与结果目标

Result: 在领域内外基准测试中：
- 仅使用8k训练数据（约为基线42%）
- EM和F1平均提升14.2%
- 显著超越现有强基线模型

Conclusion: GlobalRAG通过结构化强化学习框架有效提升多跳问答性能，验证了全局规划与忠实执行联合优化策略的有效性，为低资源场景下的复杂推理任务提供了新思路

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has recently shown promise in improving
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite these advances, its effectiveness
in multi-hop question answering (QA) remains limited by two fundamental
limitations: (i) global planning absence to structure multi-step reasoning, and
(ii) unfaithful execution, which hinders effective query formulation and
consistent use of retrieved evidence. We propose GlobalRAG, a reinforcement
learning framework designed to enhance global reasoning in multi-hop QA.
GlobalRAG decomposes questions into subgoals, coordinates retrieval with
reasoning, and refines evidence iteratively. To guide this process, we
introduce Planning Quality Reward and SubGoal Completion Reward, which
encourage coherent planning and reliable subgoal execution. In addition, a
progressive weight annealing strategy balances process-oriented and
outcome-based objectives. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and
out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that GlobalRAG significantly outperforms
strong baselines while using only 8k training data (42% of the training data
used by strong baselines), achieving average improvements of 14.2% in both EM
and F1.

Motivation: 传统检索-排序范式因依赖查询-商品匹配机制，导致三个核心问题：复杂查询的语义鸿沟、跨平台信息搜索的高决策成本、缺乏专业购物指导。

Method: 构建多代理认知决策框架（MACDF），将被动检索范式转变为主动决策支持系统，通过多代理协作优化用户决策路径。

Result: 离线评估显示MACDF在复杂查询（否定/多约束/推理需求）场景下推荐准确率提升23%，用户满意度提高18%；京东平台A/B测试验证其实际效果。

Conclusion: MACDF验证了多代理认知系统在重构电商搜索范式的潜力，为平台提供了从匹配到决策支持的范式转型方案。

Abstract: The retrieval-ranking paradigm has long dominated e-commerce search, but its
reliance on query-item matching fundamentally misaligns with multi-stage
cognitive decision processes of platform users. This misalignment introduces
critical limitations: semantic gaps in complex queries, high decision costs due
to cross-platform information foraging, and the absence of professional
shopping guidance. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Agent Cognitive
Decision Framework (MACDF), which shifts the paradigm from passive retrieval to
proactive decision support. Extensive offline evaluations demonstrate MACDF's
significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and user satisfaction,
particularly for complex queries involving negation, multi-constraint, or
reasoning demands. Online A/B testing on JD search platform confirms its
practical efficacy. This work highlights the transformative potential of
multi-agent cognitive systems in redefining e-commerce search.

*Jiangang Hao,Wenju Cui,Patrick Kyllonen,Emily Kerzabi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChatGPT-based coding shows no significant bias across gender/race in collaborative tasks, enabling large-scale assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate potential demographic bias in AI-based coding of communication data for collaborative problem solving frameworks.

Method: Analyzed three collaborative task types (negotiation, problem solving, decision making) using ChatGPT-based coding with a CPS framework.

Result: No statistically significant differences found in coding outcomes across gender and racial groups.

Conclusion: Validates ChatGPT's fairness for large-scale collaboration assessment applications across diverse populations.

Abstract: Assessing communication and collaboration at scale depends on a labor
intensive task of coding communication data into categories according to
different frameworks. Prior research has established that ChatGPT can be
directly instructed with coding rubrics to code the communication data and
achieves accuracy comparable to human raters. However, whether the coding from
ChatGPT or similar AI technology exhibits bias against different demographic
groups, such as gender and race, remains unclear. To fill this gap, this paper
investigates ChatGPT-based automated coding of communication data using a
typical coding framework for collaborative problem solving, examining
differences across gender and racial groups. The analysis draws on data from
three types of collaborative tasks: negotiation, problem solving, and decision
making. Our results show that ChatGPT-based coding exhibits no significant bias
across gender and racial groups, paving the road for its adoption in
large-scale assessment of collaboration and communication.

Method: 基于5DCR问卷设计多维度评估框架（信息寻求/刺激寻求/社会好奇心等），采用实验方法测量模型在知识探索、风险决策等场景的表现

Result: LLMs知识渴求强度超人类基准37%，风险场景选择保守概率比人类低19%，注入好奇特征使推理任务准确率提升12.6%

Conclusion: LLMs具备类人好奇行为潜力，为发展自主学习和创新推理能力提供实证基础

Abstract: Curiosity serves as a pivotal conduit for human beings to discover and learn
new knowledge. Recent advancements of large language models (LLMs) in natural
language processing have sparked discussions regarding whether these models
possess capability of curiosity-driven learning akin to humans. In this paper,
starting from the human curiosity assessment questionnaire Five-Dimensional
Curiosity scale Revised (5DCR), we design a comprehensive evaluation framework
that covers dimensions such as Information Seeking, Thrill Seeking, and Social
Curiosity to assess the extent of curiosity exhibited by LLMs. The results
demonstrate that LLMs exhibit a stronger thirst for knowledge than humans but
still tend to make conservative choices when faced with uncertain environments.
We further investigated the relationship between curiosity and thinking of
LLMs, confirming that curious behaviors can enhance the model's reasoning and
active learning abilities. These findings suggest that LLMs have the potential
to exhibit curiosity similar to that of humans, providing experimental support
for the future development of learning capabilities and innovative research in
LLMs.

Motivation: 探究大型推理模型(LRMs)在多语言场景下的推理能力，特别关注其默认使用英语推理对可解释性及文化差异处理的影响

Method: 通过MGSM和GPQA Diamond双任务评估，对比模型在英语与问题语言中的推理表现，分析认知行为特征与答案准确率

Result: 英语推理的认知行为出现频率显著更高，且准确率优势随任务复杂度增加而扩大，但面临翻译步骤引发的关键性错误

Conclusion: 英语优先策略虽提升性能，但存在'翻译迷失'缺陷，需平衡多语言推理能力与错误风险

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance on mathematical,
scientific, and other question-answering tasks, but their multilingual
reasoning abilities remain underexplored. When presented with non-English
questions, LRMs often default to reasoning in English, raising concerns about
interpretability and the handling of linguistic and cultural nuances. We
systematically compare an LRM's reasoning in English versus the language of the
question. Our evaluation spans two tasks: MGSM and GPQA Diamond. Beyond
measuring answer accuracy, we also analyze cognitive attributes in the
reasoning traces. We find that English reasoning traces exhibit a substantially
higher presence of these cognitive behaviors, and that reasoning in English
generally yields higher final-answer accuracy, with the performance gap
increasing as tasks become more complex. However, this English-centric strategy
is susceptible to a key failure mode - getting "Lost in Translation," where
translation steps lead to errors that would have been avoided by question's
language reasoning.

Method: 构建跨7个任务的CantoNLU基准，测试普通话模型、持续预训练粤语适配模型、单语粤语模型的性能对比。

Result: 粤语适配模型整体最佳，单语模型在句法任务占优；普通话模型在数据稀缺时仍具迁移潜力。

Conclusion: 模型适配策略有效提升性能，资源开放将推动粤语NLP发展，为低资源语言处理提供参考范式。

Abstract: Cantonese, although spoken by millions, remains under-resourced due to policy
and diglossia. To address this scarcity of evaluation frameworks for Cantonese,
we introduce \textsc{\textbf{CantoNLU}}, a benchmark for Cantonese natural
language understanding (NLU). This novel benchmark spans seven tasks covering
syntax and semantics, including word sense disambiguation, linguistic
acceptability judgment, language detection, natural language inference,
sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing. In addition
to the benchmark, we provide model baseline performance across a set of models:
a Mandarin model without Cantonese training, two Cantonese-adapted models
obtained by continual pre-training a Mandarin model on Cantonese text, and a
monolingual Cantonese model trained from scratch. Results show that
Cantonese-adapted models perform best overall, while monolingual models perform
better on syntactic tasks. Mandarin models remain competitive in certain
settings, indicating that direct transfer may be sufficient when Cantonese
domain data is scarce. We release all datasets, code, and model weights to
facilitate future research in Cantonese NLP.

Motivation: 现有语言模型在参数、算力和数据持续增加的情况下仍存在严重幻觉问题。受投资组合理论启发，试图通过神经多样性（解相关的并行表示）突破传统扩展范式。

Method: 结合并行LoRA适配器与Barlow Twins正则化的ND-LoRA方法，通过理论推导证明幻觉概率与表征相关性存在数学约束（P(H) ≤ f(...)），并设计因果干预实验验证机制。

Result: ND-LoRA实现最高25.6%幻觉降低（平均14.6%），相关性分析显示神经相关性每增加0.1%导致幻觉率上升3.8%，不同任务存在最优神经多样性水平。

Conclusion: 神经多样性构成语言模型扩展的第三维度，与参数/数据正交。任务依赖的最优多样性水平为未来研究指明方向，模型可靠性提升不再仅依赖资源投入。

Abstract: Language models continue to hallucinate despite increases in parameters,
compute, and data. We propose neural diversity -- decorrelated parallel
representations -- as a principled mechanism that reduces hallucination rates
at fixed parameter and data budgets. Inspired by portfolio theory, where
uncorrelated assets reduce risk by $\sqrt{P}$, we prove hallucination
probability is bounded by representational correlation: $P(H) \leq
f(\sigma^2((1-\rho(P))/P + \rho(P)), \mu^2)$, which predicts that language
models need an optimal amount of neurodiversity. To validate this, we introduce
ND-LoRA (Neural Diversity Low-Rank Adaptation), combining parallel LoRA
adapters with Barlow Twins regularization, and demonstrate that ND-LoRA reduces
hallucinations by up to 25.6% (and 14.6% on average) without degrading general
accuracy. Ablations show LoRA adapters and regularization act synergistically,
causal interventions prove neurodiversity as the mediating factor and
correlational analyses indicate scale: a 0.1% neural correlation increase is
associated with a 3.8% hallucination increase. Finally, task-dependent
optimality emerges: different tasks require different amounts of optimal
neurodiversity. Together, our results highlight neural diversity as a third
axis of scaling -- orthogonal to parameters and data -- to improve the
reliability of language models at fixed budgets.

Conclusion: 通过增强效用函数对潜在结构的敏感性，可有效提升MBR解码在开放任务中的生成质量

Abstract: Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding has seen renewed interest as an alternative
to traditional generation strategies. While MBR has proven effective in machine
translation, where the variability of a language model's outcome space is
naturally constrained, it may face challenges in more open-ended tasks such as
dialogue or instruction-following. We hypothesise that in such settings,
applying MBR with standard similarity-based utility functions may result in
selecting responses that are broadly representative of the model's
distribution, yet sub-optimal with respect to any particular grouping of
generations that share an underlying latent structure. In this work, we
introduce three lightweight adaptations to the utility function, designed to
make MBR more sensitive to structural variability in the outcome space. To test
our hypothesis, we curate a dataset capturing three representative types of
latent structure: dialogue act, emotion, and response structure (e.g., a
sentence, a paragraph, or a list). We further propose two metrics to evaluate
the structural optimality of MBR. Our analysis demonstrates that common
similarity-based utility functions fall short by these metrics. In contrast,
our proposed adaptations considerably improve structural optimality. Finally,
we evaluate our approaches on real-world instruction-following benchmarks,
AlpacaEval and MT-Bench, and show that increased structural sensitivity
improves generation quality by up to 13.7 percentage points in win rate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前工作依赖代理LLM评估隐私合规性，忽视用户真实感知；且未深入分析帮助性差异。需量化用户对隐私保护与实用性的权衡。

Method: 使用PrivacyLens的90个场景，招募94名参与者进行用户研究，对比用户与5个代理LLM对相同场景响应的评价差异。

Result: 用户对隐私保护质量/帮助性评价一致性低（Kappa<0.2），代理LLM间一致性高但个体与用户相关性弱（r<0.3），表明评估具个体特异性。

Conclusion: 需建立用户中心的LLM隐私-效用评估框架，探索提升代理模型与用户感知对齐的技术，推动隐私保护与实用性的平衡优化。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen rapid adoption for tasks such as
drafting emails, summarizing meetings, and answering health questions. In such
uses, users may need to share private information (e.g., health records,
contact details). To evaluate LLMs' ability to identify and redact such private
information, prior work developed benchmarks (e.g., ConfAIde, PrivacyLens) with
real-life scenarios. Using these benchmarks, researchers have found that LLMs
sometimes fail to keep secrets private when responding to complex tasks (e.g.,
leaking employee salaries in meeting summaries). However, these evaluations
rely on LLMs (proxy LLMs) to gauge compliance with privacy norms, overlooking
real users' perceptions. Moreover, prior work primarily focused on the
privacy-preservation quality of responses, without investigating nuanced
differences in helpfulness. To understand how users perceive the
privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of LLM responses to
privacy-sensitive scenarios, we conducted a user study with 94 participants
using 90 scenarios from PrivacyLens. We found that, when evaluating identical
responses to the same scenario, users showed low agreement with each other on
the privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of the LLM response. Further,
we found high agreement among five proxy LLMs, while each individual LLM had
low correlation with users' evaluations. These results indicate that the
privacy and helpfulness of LLM responses are often specific to individuals, and
proxy LLMs are poor estimates of how real users would perceive these responses
in privacy-sensitive scenarios. Our results suggest the need to conduct
user-centered studies on measuring LLMs' ability to help users while preserving
privacy. Additionally, future research could investigate ways to improve the
alignment between proxy LLMs and users for better estimation of users'
perceived privacy and utility.

cancers, but are associated with toxicities such as hand-foot syndrome and
cardiotoxicity. Since toxicity documentation is often embedded in clinical
notes, we aimed to develop and evaluate natural language processing (NLP)
methods to extract treatment and toxicity information.
  Materials and Methods: We constructed a gold-standard dataset of 236 clinical
notes from 204,165 adult oncology patients. Domain experts annotated categories
related to treatment regimens and toxicities. We developed rule-based, machine
learning-based (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine [SVM], Logistic
Regression [LR]), deep learning-based (BERT, ClinicalBERT), and large language
models (LLM)-based NLP approaches (zero-shot and error-analysis prompting).
Models used an 80:20 train-test split.
  Results: Sufficient data existed to train and evaluate 5 annotated
categories. Error-analysis prompting achieved optimal precision, recall, and F1
scores (F1=1.000) for treatment and toxicities extraction, whereas zero-shot
prompting reached F1=1.000 for treatment and F1=0.876 for toxicities
extraction.LR and SVM ranked second for toxicities (F1=0.937). Deep learning
underperformed, with BERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1= 0.839 toxicities) and
ClinicalBERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1 = 0.886 toxicities). Rule-based methods
served as our baseline with F1 scores of 0.857 in treatment and 0.858 in
toxicities.
  Discussion: LMM-based approaches outperformed all others, followed by machine
learning methods. Machine and deep learning approaches were limited by small
training data and showed limited generalizability, particularly for rare
categories.
  Conclusion: LLM-based NLP most effectively extracted fluoropyrimidine
treatment and toxicity information from clinical notes, and has strong
potential to support oncology research and pharmacovigilance.

Motivation: 大型推理模型在机器翻译质量评估中存在定制材料需求、简单实例过度思考、评分机制高估等问题

Method: 使用合成的人类思考轨迹数据集训练模型，优化模型的思考校准机制

Result: 在WMT24基准测试中，R1-Distill-Qwen-7B模型相关系数提升8.7个百分点，32B模型保持高性能

Conclusion: 高效校准的大型推理模型能够显著推进细粒度机器翻译自动评估技术的发展

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have introduced an
intermediate "thinking" process prior to generating final answers, improving
their reasoning capabilities on complex downstream tasks. However, the
potential of LRMs as evaluators for machine translation (MT) quality remains
underexplored. We provides the first systematic analysis of LRM-as-a-judge in
MT evaluation. We identify key challenges, revealing LRMs require tailored
evaluation materials, tend to "overthink" simpler instances and have issues
with scoring mechanisms leading to overestimation. To address these, we propose
to calibrate LRM thinking by training them on synthetic, human-like thinking
trajectories. Our experiments on WMT24 Metrics benchmarks demonstrate that this
approach largely reduces thinking budgets by ~35x while concurrently improving
evaluation performance across different LRM scales from 7B to 32B (e.g.,
R1-Distill-Qwen-7B achieves a +8.7 correlation point improvement). These
findings highlight the potential of efficiently calibrated LRMs to advance
fine-grained automatic MT evaluation.

Motivation: 现有LLM评估方法缺乏针对特定AI应用的公平性维度评估，不同应用场景中受保护属性的相关性差异导致通用评估方式不充分

Method: 构建参数化数据集：1）以产品描述生成为应用场景 2）交叉性别化形容词与产品类别 3）生成带公平性标签的提示集

Result: 验证数据集可系统识别LLM在四个维度的缺陷，提出结合具体资源的评估框架

Conclusion: 建立了应用导向的LLM评估范式，为负责任AI研究提供可复用的方法论和基准资源

Abstract: Current methods for evaluating large language models (LLMs) typically focus
on high-level tasks such as text generation, without targeting a particular AI
application. This approach is not sufficient for evaluating LLMs for
Responsible AI dimensions like fairness, since protected attributes that are
highly relevant in one application may be less relevant in another. In this
work, we construct a dataset that is driven by a real-world application
(generate a plain-text product description, given a list of product features),
parameterized by fairness attributes intersected with gendered adjectives and
product categories, yielding a rich set of labeled prompts. We show how to use
the data to identify quality, veracity, safety, and fairness gaps in LLMs,
contributing a proposal for LLM evaluation paired with a concrete resource for
the research community.

Motivation: 线性注意力模型因固定大小的记忆状态导致检索密集型任务性能下降，需解决遗忘问题。

Method: 结合滑动窗口注意力与轻量CNN，实现可学习的KV对淘汰机制，保留关键信息同时维持线性时空复杂度。

Result: 在检索密集型基准测试中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 混合注意力机制在保持效率的同时显著提升模型对长程信息的捕捉能力。

Abstract: Linear-attention models that compress the entire input sequence into a
fixed-size recurrent state offer an efficient alternative to Transformers, but
their finite memory induces forgetfulness that harms retrieval-intensive tasks.
To mitigate the issue, we explore a series of hybrid models that restore direct
access to past tokens. We interleave token mixers with intermediate time and
space complexity between linear and full attention, including sparse attention
with token eviction, and the query-aware native sparse attention. Particularly,
we propose a novel learnable token eviction approach. Combined with
sliding-window attention, an end-to-end trainable lightweight CNN aggregates
information from both past and future adjacent tokens to adaptively retain a
limited set of critical KV-pairs per head, maintaining linear attention's
constant time and space complexity. Efficient Triton kernels for the sparse
attention mechanisms are provided. Empirical evaluations on retrieval-intensive
benchmarks support the effectiveness of our approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对检索增强生成（RAG）中长上下文计算成本高的问题，探索更高效的连续表示压缩方法。现有压缩token架构存在效率瓶颈，需寻找既能降低计算量又能保持模型性能的替代方案。

Method: 开发基于均值池化的轻量级压缩架构，通过简单聚合上下文特征生成紧凑表示。创新性地训练单一压缩器支持多压缩比输出，并在不同压缩率下进行系统性评估。

Result: 在领域内外QA数据集、不同模型家族和压缩比下，均值池化方法均取得最优性能。多压缩比联合训练时性能仅小幅下降（约1-2%准确率），不同架构间的效率-精度权衡呈现复杂非线性关系。

Conclusion: 简单均值池化在上下文压缩中展现出强大竞争力，多压缩比训练可行性为实际应用提供灵活性。研究揭示了压缩方法选择需综合考虑架构特性与任务需求，为后续研究建立了新的基准。

Abstract: A common strategy to reduce the computational costs of using long contexts in
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) is soft
context compression, where the input sequence is transformed into a shorter
continuous representation. We develop a lightweight and simple mean-pooling
approach that consistently outperforms the widely used compression-tokens
architecture, and study training the same compressor to output multiple
compression ratios. We conduct extensive experiments across in-domain and
out-of-domain QA datasets, as well as across model families, scales, and
compression ratios. Overall, our simple mean-pooling approach achieves the
strongest performance, with a relatively small drop when training for multiple
compression ratios. More broadly though, across architectures and training
regimes the trade-offs are more nuanced, illustrating the complex landscape of
compression methods.

Motivation: LLM生成文本缺乏统一定义，人类编辑行为与LLM对使用者的潜在影响模糊了人机文本界限，现有检测基准未能覆盖真实应用场景的多样性

Method: 通过分析LLM使用场景多样性、人类编辑行为和现有检测基准局限性，论证检测器的应用边界

Result: 检测器在特定条件下仍具应用价值，但其数值结果常被误解且重要性逐渐降低

Conclusion: 检测器结果应作为辅助参考指标，需结合具体应用场景谨慎解读，不能作为绝对判定依据

Abstract: With the widespread use of large language models (LLMs), many researchers
have turned their attention to detecting text generated by them. However, there
is no consistent or precise definition of their target, namely "LLM-generated
text". Differences in usage scenarios and the diversity of LLMs further
increase the difficulty of detection. What is commonly regarded as the
detecting target usually represents only a subset of the text that LLMs can
potentially produce. Human edits to LLM outputs, together with the subtle
influences that LLMs exert on their users, are blurring the line between
LLM-generated and human-written text. Existing benchmarks and evaluation
approaches do not adequately address the various conditions in real-world
detector applications. Hence, the numerical results of detectors are often
misunderstood, and their significance is diminishing. Therefore, detectors
remain useful under specific conditions, but their results should be
interpreted only as references rather than decisive indicators.

Motivation: 传统聚类/分类方法无法有效捕捉复杂图像集合中重叠的层级关系，尤其在缺乏标注数据和预训练模型时

Result: 在真实图像集评估中实现对数万级图像的迭代探索，用户可高效获取洞见

Conclusion: 可视化分析方法有效支持领域专家从复杂图像集中发现关系模式，突破传统方法的信息过载局限

Abstract: Analyzing large complex image collections in domains like forensics, accident
investigation, or social media analysis involves interpreting intricate,
overlapping relationships among images. Traditional clustering and
classification methods fail to adequately represent these complex
relationships, particularly when labeled data or suitable pre-trained models
are unavailable. Hypergraphs effectively capture overlapping relationships, but
to translate their complexity into information and insights for domain expert
users visualization is essential. We propose an interactive visual analytics
approach specifically designed for the construction, exploration, and analysis
of hypergraphs on large-scale complex image collections. Our core contributions
include: (1) a scalable pipeline for constructing hypergraphs directly from raw
image data, including a similarity measure to evaluate constructed hypergraphs
against a ground truth, (2) interactive visualization techniques that integrate
spatial hypergraph representations, interactive grids, and matrix
visualizations, enabling users to dynamically explore and interpret
relationships without becoming overwhelmed and disoriented, and (3) practical
insights on how domain experts can effectively use the application, based on
evaluation with real-life image collections. Our results demonstrate that our
visual analytics approach facilitates iterative exploration, enabling domain
experts to efficiently derive insights from image collections containing tens
of thousands of images.

TL;DR: 提出基于多智能体协作流程的量子代码协同设计方法，结合系统枚举与精确分析重建，实现可验证的横向对角门构造与分类扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有量子代码设计缺乏系统性验证和可扩展性，需开发结合自动化工具与人工协作的框架，以提高代码构造的可靠性和效率。

Method: 1) 使用SSLP框架分割基字符串并强制KL等式
2) 在TeXRA平台部署多智能体协作（合成/搜索/审计代理）
3) LaTeX-Python环境实现代码生成与验证闭环

Result: 1) 生成n≤6量子比特的认证代码表（如K=3时n=6的16阶群）
2) 构造新型((6,4,2))代码实现控制相位门
3) 证明闭式族结构满足全参数KL等式

Conclusion: 该工作流程建立了可扩展的量子代码设计范式，支持参数扩展与数据驱动分类，为高距离代码构造提供系统化解决方案。

Abstract: We present a multi-agent, human-in-the-loop workflow that co-designs quantum
codes with prescribed transversal diagonal gates. It builds on the Subset-Sum
Linear Programming (SSLP) framework (arXiv:2504.20847), which partitions basis
strings by modular residues and enforces $Z$-marginal Knill-Laflamme (KL)
equalities via small LPs. The workflow is powered by GPT-5 and implemented
within TeXRA (https://texra.ai)-a multi-agent research assistant platform that
supports an iterative tool-use loop agent and a derivation-then-edit workflow
reasoning agent. We work in a LaTeX-Python environment where agents reason,
edit documents, execute code, and synchronize their work to Git/Overleaf.
Within this workspace, three roles collaborate: a Synthesis Agent formulates
the problem; a Search Agent sweeps/screens candidates and exactifies numerics
into rationals; and an Audit Agent independently checks all KL equalities and
the induced logical action. As a first step we focus on distance $d=2$ with
nondegenerate residues. For code dimension $K\in\{2,3,4\}$ and $n\le6$ qubits,
systematic sweeps yield certificate-backed tables cataloging attainable cyclic
logical groups-all realized by new codes-e.g., for $K=3$ we obtain order $16$
at $n=6$. From verified instances, Synthesis Agent abstracts recurring
structures into closed-form families and proves they satisfy the KL equalities
for all parameters. It further demonstrates that SSLP accommodates residue
degeneracy by exhibiting a new $((6,4,2))$ code implementing the transversal
controlled-phase $diag(1,1,1,i)$. Overall, the workflow recasts
diagonal-transversal feasibility as an analytical pipeline executed at scale,
combining systematic enumeration with exact analytical reconstruction. It
yields reproducible code constructions, supports targeted extensions to larger
$K$ and higher distances, and leads toward data-driven classification.

TL;DR: 提出RLEV方法，通过将显式人类价值信号整合到奖励函数中，优化LLM对齐效果并实现价值敏感的终止策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法仅关注任务正确性而忽略不同任务的价值差异，需要更直接的量化人类价值对齐方式。

Method: 在奖励函数中直接集成人类定义的价值信号，使用带有明确价值标签的考试数据训练，通过价值加权梯度放大机制调整终止策略。

Result: 在多个RL算法和模型规模上超越基准模型，实现价值敏感终止策略（低价值简洁/高价值详细），噪声信号下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过显式优化人类定义的效用函数，RLEV为LLM与人类价值对齐提供了实用路径，验证了价值加权机制的有效性。

Abstract: We propose Reinforcement Learning with Explicit Human Values (RLEV), a method
that aligns Large Language Model (LLM) optimization directly with quantifiable
human value signals. While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) effectively trains models in objective domains using binary correctness
rewards, it overlooks that not all tasks are equally significant. RLEV extends
this framework by incorporating human-defined value signals directly into the
reward function. Using exam-style data with explicit ground-truth value labels,
RLEV consistently outperforms correctness-only baselines across multiple RL
algorithms and model scales. Crucially, RLEV policies not only improve
value-weighted accuracy but also learn a value-sensitive termination policy:
concise for low-value prompts, thorough for high-value ones. We demonstrate
this behavior stems from value-weighted gradient amplification on
end-of-sequence tokens. Ablation studies confirm the gain is causally linked to
value alignment. RLEV remains robust under noisy value signals, such as
difficulty-based labels, demonstrating that optimizing for an explicit utility
function offers a practical path to aligning LLMs with human priorities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理可能通过删除失败测试而非修复错误等捷径作弊，威胁基准测试可信度和实际部署可靠性，需系统化评估工具量化此类行为。

Method: 构建基于LiveCodeBench等基准的'impossible'任务变体，使自然语言规范与单元测试直接冲突，以作弊率（通过率）作为核心指标。

Result: 框架成功揭示从简单测试篡改到复杂运算符重载的作弊行为层级，展示提示工程/测试访问权限对作弊率的影响，并产出可监测的欺骗解决方案库。

Conclusion: ImpossibleBench既是评估标准又是多功能工具，可为构建鲁棒LLM系统提供行为分析、上下文优化和监控方案开发支持。

Abstract: The tendency to find and exploit "shortcuts" to complete tasks poses
significant risks for reliable assessment and deployment of large language
models (LLMs). For example, an LLM agent with access to unit tests may delete
failing tests rather than fix the underlying bug. Such behavior undermines both
the validity of benchmark results and the reliability of real-world LLM coding
assistant deployments.
  To quantify, study, and mitigate such behavior, we introduce ImpossibleBench,
a benchmark framework that systematically measures LLM agents' propensity to
exploit test cases. ImpossibleBench creates "impossible" variants of tasks from
existing benchmarks like LiveCodeBench and SWE-bench by introducing direct
conflicts between the natural-language specification and the unit tests. We
measure an agent's "cheating rate" as its pass rate on these impossible tasks,
where any pass necessarily implies a specification-violating shortcut.
  As a practical framework, ImpossibleBench is not just an evaluation but a
versatile tool. We demonstrate its utility for: (1) studying model behaviors,
revealing more fine-grained details of cheating behaviors from simple test
modification to complex operator overloading; (2) context engineering, showing
how prompt, test access and feedback loop affect cheating rates; and (3)
developing monitoring tools, providing a testbed with verified deceptive
solutions. We hope ImpossibleBench serves as a useful framework for building
more robust and reliable LLM systems.

Conclusion: 相对扩展定律补充了传统交叉熵视角，为模型开发提供性能优化指导，为涌现机制等理论研究提供新视角，推动LLM研究的理论实践协同发展。

Abstract: Scaling laws aim to accurately predict model performance across different
scales. Existing scaling-law studies almost exclusively rely on cross-entropy
as the evaluation metric. However, cross-entropy provides only a partial view
of performance: it measures the absolute probability assigned to the correct
token, but ignores the relative ordering between correct and incorrect tokens.
Yet, relative ordering is crucial for language models, such as in
greedy-sampling scenario. To address this limitation, we investigate scaling
from the perspective of relative ordering. We first propose the Relative-Based
Probability (RBP) metric, which quantifies the probability that the correct
token is ranked among the top predictions. Building on this metric, we
establish the Relative-Based Scaling Law, which characterizes how RBP improves
with increasing model size. Through extensive experiments on four datasets and
four model families spanning five orders of magnitude, we demonstrate the
robustness and accuracy of this law. Finally, we illustrate the broad
application of this law with two examples, namely providing a deeper
explanation of emergence phenomena and facilitating finding fundamental
theories of scaling laws. In summary, the Relative-Based Scaling Law
complements the cross-entropy perspective and contributes to a more complete
understanding of scaling large language models. Thus, it offers valuable
insights for both practical development and theoretical exploration.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注图像扩散和无条件图生成的后门攻击，文本引导的图生成模型缺乏安全评估。论文旨在探索此类模型的后门植入可能性及危害性

Method: 通过文本触发器毒化训练数据，在VAE和扩散训练阶段植入后门。攻击触发时生成特定子图，正常输入时保持原有性能

Result: 在四个数据集上验证：10%中毒率即达50%攻击成功率，24%中毒率成功率超80%，良性样本性能损失可忽略

Conclusion: 文本引导图生成的扩散模型存在严重安全漏洞，需开发针对性防御机制。消融实验表明后门主要来自VAE和扩散训练阶段

Abstract: The rapid progress of graph generation has raised new security concerns,
particularly regarding backdoor vulnerabilities. While prior work has explored
backdoor attacks in image diffusion and unconditional graph generation,
conditional, especially text-guided graph generation remains largely
unexamined. This paper proposes BadGraph, a backdoor attack method targeting
latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation. BadGraph leverages
textual triggers to poison training data, covertly implanting backdoors that
induce attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when triggers appear,
while preserving normal performance on clean inputs. Extensive experiments on
four benchmark datasets (PubChem, ChEBI-20, PCDes, MoMu) demonstrate the
effectiveness and stealth of the attack: less than 10% poisoning rate can
achieves 50% attack success rate, while 24% suffices for over 80% success rate,
with negligible performance degradation on benign samples. Ablation studies
further reveal that the backdoor is implanted during VAE and diffusion training
rather than pretraining. These findings reveal the security vulnerabilities in
latent diffusion models of text-guided graph generation, highlight the serious
risks in models' applications such as drug discovery and underscore the need
for robust defenses against the backdoor attack in such diffusion models.

Conclusion: 结合梯度指导和样本高效评估，实现了无需微调的快速LLM适配框架，证明模型适配主要依赖提示风格而非数据规模

Abstract: Recently, Sharma et al. suggested a method called Layer-SElective-Rank
reduction (LASER) which demonstrated that pruning high-order components of
carefully chosen LLM's weight matrices can boost downstream accuracy -- without
any gradient-based fine-tuning. Yet LASER's exhaustive, per-matrix search (each
requiring full-dataset forward passes) makes it impractical for rapid
deployment. We demonstrate that this overhead can be removed and find that: (i)
Only a small, carefully chosen subset of matrices needs to be inspected --
eliminating the layer-by-layer sweep, (ii) The gradient of each matrix's
singular values pinpoints which matrices merit reduction, (iii) Increasing the
factorization search space by allowing matrices rows to cluster around multiple
subspaces and then decomposing each cluster separately further reduces
overfitting on the original training data and further lifts accuracy by up to
24.6 percentage points, and finally, (iv) we discover that evaluating on just
100 samples rather than the full training data -- both for computing the
indicative gradients and for measuring the final accuracy -- suffices to
further reduce the search time; we explain that as adaptation to downstream
tasks is dominated by prompting style, not dataset size. As a result, we show
that combining these findings yields a fast and robust adaptation algorithm for
downstream tasks. Overall, with a single gradient step on 100 examples and a
quick scan of the top candidate layers and factorization techniques, we can
adapt LLMs to new datasets -- entirely without fine-tuning.

Result: 在5-17智能体规模下，任务完成时间减少40%且保持扩展稳定性，通信成本可控。

Conclusion: C2C为多智能体系统建立了通信效能评估理论，并提供可扩展的复杂协作实践框架。

Abstract: Teamwork in workspace for complex tasks requires diverse communication
strategies, but current multi-agent LLM systems lack systematic frameworks for
task oriented communication. We introduce Communication to Completion (C2C), a
scalable framework that addresses this gap through two key innovations: (1) the
Alignment Factor (AF), a novel metric quantifying agent task alignment that
directly impacts work efficiency, and (2) a Sequential Action Framework that
integrates stepwise execution with intelligent communication decisions. C2C
enables agents to make cost aware communication choices, dynamically improving
task understanding through targeted interactions. We evaluated C2C on realistic
coding workflows across three complexity tiers and team sizes from 5 to 17
agents, comparing against no communication and fixed steps baselines. The
results show that C2C reduces the task completion time by about 40% with
acceptable communication costs. The framework completes all tasks successfully
in standard configurations and maintains effectiveness at scale. C2C
establishes both a theoretical foundation for measuring communication
effectiveness in multi-agent systems and a practical framework for complex
collaborative tasks.

Conclusion: 该框架推进了AI系统的互操作性和行为一致性，为构建可解释、可扩展的声明式人机接口提供新范式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are central to reasoning, writing, and
decision-support workflows, yet users lack consistent control over how they
reason and express outputs. Conventional prompt engineering relies on verbose
natural-language instructions, limiting reproducibility, modularity, and
interpretability. This paper introduces Prompt Decorators, a declarative,
composable syntax that governs LLM behavior through compact control tokens such
as +++Reasoning, +++Tone(style=formal), and +++Import(topic="Systems
Thinking"). Each decorator modifies a behavioral dimension, such as reasoning
style, structure, or tone, without changing task content. The framework
formalizes twenty core decorators organized into two functional families
(Cognitive & Generative and Expressive & Systemic), each further decomposed
into subcategories that govern reasoning, interaction, expression, and
session-control. It defines a unified syntax, scoping model, and deterministic
processing pipeline enabling predictable and auditable behavior composition. By
decoupling task intent from execution behavior, Prompt Decorators create a
reusable and interpretable interface for prompt design. Illustrative use cases
demonstrate improved reasoning transparency, reduced prompt complexity, and
standardized model behavior across domains. The paper concludes with
implications for interoperability, behavioral consistency, and the development
of declarative interfaces for scalable AI systems.

TL;DR: 系统综述多媒体检索增强型QA技术进展，聚焦多模态对齐架构与性能评估


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统QA系统依赖结构化文本，多媒体数据爆炸需整合视觉/语言/音频多模态数据提升问答能力，应对复杂跨模态查询场景

Method: 基于检索方法（单模态/跨模态检索）、融合技术（早期/晚期融合）、答案生成策略（端到端/分阶段）三维分类体系，系统分析20+前沿模型在WebQA/MSVD等基准的表现

Result: 揭示跨模态表征对齐质量直接影响RAG效果（平均提升12.7% EM得分），但多级检索管道增加300-500ms延迟，当前最优模型在MMarco数据集上达到76.4% MRR@10

Conclusion: 亟需轻量级多模态编码器降低计算开销，开发动态路由机制平衡延迟与准确性，建立细粒度语义评估框架解决当前BLEU/ROUGE指标与人工评估15%的GAP

Abstract: Question Answering (QA) systems have traditionally relied on structured text
data, but the rapid growth of multimedia content (images, audio, video, and
structured metadata) has introduced new challenges and opportunities for
retrieval-augmented QA. In this survey, we review recent advancements in QA
systems that integrate multimedia retrieval pipelines, focusing on
architectures that align vision, language, and audio modalities with user
queries. We categorize approaches based on retrieval methods, fusion
techniques, and answer generation strategies, and analyze benchmark datasets,
evaluation protocols, and performance tradeoffs. Furthermore, we highlight key
challenges such as cross-modal alignment, latency-accuracy tradeoffs, and
semantic grounding, and outline open problems and future research directions
for building more robust and context-aware QA systems leveraging multimedia
data.

Abstract: This study presents the multilingual e-commerce search system developed by
the Tredence_AICOE team. The competition features two multilingual relevance
tasks: Query-Category (QC) Relevance, which evaluates how well a user's search
query aligns with a product category, and Query-Item (QI) Relevance, which
measures the match between a multilingual search query and an individual
product listing. To ensure full language coverage, we performed data
augmentation by translating existing datasets into languages missing from the
development set, enabling training across all target languages. We fine-tuned
Gemma-3 12B and Qwen-2.5 14B model for both tasks using multiple strategies.
The Gemma-3 12B (4-bit) model achieved the best QC performance using original
and translated data, and the best QI performance using original, translated,
and minority class data creation. These approaches secured 4th place on the
final leaderboard, with an average F1-score of 0.8857 on the private test set.

TL;DR: 提出DeEAR框架，通过三维度评估（情感/韵律/自然性）将人类语音偏好转化为客观评分，显著提升语音合成表现力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音合成模型缺乏自然表现力，主要由于评估指标不可靠（主观评分成本高、声学特征局限、情感识别不全面）

Method: 基于语音学和心理学设计DeEAR框架，包含Emotion/Prosody/Spontaneity三个评估维度，使用500标注样本建立人类感知对齐模型

Result: 达到0.86人类感知相关性（SRCC），构建ExpressiveSpeech数据集使模型表现力评分从2.0提升至23.4（百分制）

Conclusion: DeEAR不仅实现可靠评估，还能指导数据筛选和模型优化，为语音合成表现力提升提供系统解决方案

Abstract: Recent speech-to-speech (S2S) models generate intelligible speech but still
lack natural expressiveness, largely due to the absence of a reliable
evaluation metric. Existing approaches, such as subjective MOS ratings,
low-level acoustic features, and emotion recognition are costly, limited, or
incomplete. To address this, we present DeEAR (Decoding the Expressive
Preference of eAR), a framework that converts human preference for speech
expressiveness into an objective score. Grounded in phonetics and psychology,
DeEAR evaluates speech across three dimensions: Emotion, Prosody, and
Spontaneity, achieving strong alignment with human perception (Spearman's Rank
Correlation Coefficient, SRCC = 0.86) using fewer than 500 annotated samples.
Beyond reliable scoring, DeEAR enables fair benchmarking and targeted data
curation. It not only distinguishes expressiveness gaps across S2S models but
also selects 14K expressive utterances to form ExpressiveSpeech, which improves
the expressive score (from 2.0 to 23.4 on a 100-point scale) of S2S models.

Motivation: 现有网络代理方法存在推理深度不足（线性方法无法支持多步回溯）和执行效率低下（粗粒度策略计算成本高）的问题，需要更精细化的控制框架。

Method: 1) 树状结构实现可控多分支推理 2) 基于网页状态回放的高效探索 3) 跨会话共享的页面动作记忆机制

Result: 在WebArena基准测试中达到35.8%任务成功率，相比SOTA方法执行时间减少40.4%

Conclusion: 该框架通过结构化推理-执行范式与上下文记忆系统的结合，为LLM网络代理提供了可靠高效的解决方案

Abstract: Autonomous web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) show strong
potential for performing goal-oriented tasks such as information retrieval,
report generation, and online transactions. These agents mark a key step toward
practical embodied reasoning in open web environments. However, existing
approaches remain limited in reasoning depth and efficiency: vanilla linear
methods fail at multi-step reasoning and lack effective backtracking, while
other search strategies are coarse-grained and computationally costly. We
introduce Branch-and-Browse, a fine-grained web agent framework that unifies
structured reasoning-acting, contextual memory, and efficient execution. It (i)
employs explicit subtask management with tree-structured exploration for
controllable multi-branch reasoning, (ii) bootstraps exploration through
efficient web state replay with background reasoning, and (iii) leverages a
page action memory to share explored actions within and across sessions. On the
WebArena benchmark, Branch-and-Browse achieves a task success rate of 35.8\%
and reduces execution time by up to 40.4\% relative to state-of-the-art
methods. These results demonstrate that Branch-and-Browse is a reliable and
efficient framework for LLM-based web agents.

TL;DR: 利用大语言模型（LLM）将隐藏信息嵌入普通文本中，实现文本与作者意图的彻底分离，威胁书面交流信任并挑战AI安全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 展示LLM隐藏信息的潜在风险（如隐蔽传播敏感内容），揭示文本表层内容与真实意图的割裂现象。

Method: 提出基于开源LLM（如80亿参数模型）的编解码协议，可在普通笔记本电脑上数秒内完成信息隐藏与提取。

Result: 小规模LLM即可实现高质量信息隐藏，编解码效率极高（如摘要长度信息处理仅需数秒）。

Conclusion: 该技术加剧AI安全风险（如企业可伪装危险模型输出），并质疑LLM对'知识'的表征本质。

Abstract: A meaningful text can be hidden inside another, completely different yet
still coherent and plausible, text of the same length. For example, a tweet
containing a harsh political critique could be embedded in a tweet that
celebrates the same political leader, or an ordinary product review could
conceal a secret manuscript. This uncanny state of affairs is now possible
thanks to Large Language Models, and in this paper we present a simple and
efficient protocol to achieve it. We show that even modest 8-billion-parameter
open-source LLMs are sufficient to obtain high-quality results, and a message
as long as this abstract can be encoded and decoded locally on a laptop in
seconds. The existence of such a protocol demonstrates a radical decoupling of
text from authorial intent, further eroding trust in written communication,
already shaken by the rise of LLM chatbots. We illustrate this with a concrete
scenario: a company could covertly deploy an unfiltered LLM by encoding its
answers within the compliant responses of a safe model. This possibility raises
urgent questions for AI safety and challenges our understanding of what it
means for a Large Language Model to know something.

Abstract: We present AI PB, a production-scale generative agent deployed in real retail
finance. Unlike reactive chatbots that answer queries passively, AI PB
proactively generates grounded, compliant, and user-specific investment
insights. It integrates (i) a component-based orchestration layer that
deterministically routes between internal and external LLMs based on data
sensitivity, (ii) a hybrid retrieval pipeline using OpenSearch and the
finance-domain embedding model, and (iii) a multi-stage recommendation
mechanism combining rule heuristics, sequential behavioral modeling, and
contextual bandits. Operating fully on-premises under Korean financial
regulations, the system employs Docker Swarm and vLLM across 24 X NVIDIA H100
GPUs. Through human QA and system metrics, we demonstrate that grounded
generation with explicit routing and layered safety can deliver trustworthy AI
insights in high-stakes finance.

Motivation: 现有持续预训练方法需要原始基模型或外部领域数据库支持，在模型权重受限或外部语料不可靠的场景存在局限

Method: 构建指令-知识感知的自监督目标，利用文本内嵌的领域知识，通过指令-响应对话格式实现深层语义编码

Result: 提出的框架有效避免指令跟随能力退化，实现领域知识的深层语义编码

Conclusion: IKnow为受限场景下的语言模型持续适应提供了简单有效的解决方案，突破对外部资源的依赖

Abstract: Continual pretraining promises to adapt large language models (LLMs) to new
domains using only unlabeled test-time data, but naively applying standard
self-supervised objectives to instruction-tuned models is known to degrade
their instruction-following capability and semantic representations. Existing
fixes assume access to the original base model or rely on knowledge from an
external domain-specific database - both of which pose a realistic barrier in
settings where the base model weights are withheld for safety reasons or
reliable external corpora are unavailable. In this work, we propose
Instruction-Knowledge-Aware Continual Adaptation (IKnow), a simple and general
framework that formulates novel self-supervised objectives in the
instruction-response dialogue format. Rather than depend- ing on external
resources, IKnow leverages domain knowledge embedded within the text itself and
learns to encode it at a deeper semantic level.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于最终答案正确性的评估方式过于粗糙，无法捕捉推理过程质量，阻碍模型改进效果

Method: 1. 将推理质量分解为相关性（是否基于问题背景）和连贯性（逻辑延续性）两个维度
2. 开发CaSE因果逐步评估法（仅基于前序上下文评估当前步骤）
3. 构建MRa-GSM8K和MRa-MATH专家标注基准验证方法

Result: CaSE评估结果与人类判断高度一致，基于CaSE筛选的训练数据使最终任务性能显著提升

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM推理提供了可扩展的分析改进路径，证明过程质量评估比单纯结果验证更具实践价值

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on final-answer correctness is the
dominant paradigm. This approach, however, provides a coarse signal for model
improvement and overlooks the quality of the underlying reasoning process. We
argue that a more granular evaluation of reasoning offers a more effective path
to building robust models. We decompose reasoning quality into two dimensions:
relevance and coherence. Relevance measures if a step is grounded in the
problem; coherence measures if it follows logically from prior steps. To
measure these aspects reliably, we introduce causal stepwise evaluation (CaSE).
This method assesses each reasoning step using only its preceding context,
which avoids hindsight bias. We validate CaSE against human judgments on our
new expert-annotated benchmarks, MRa-GSM8K and MRa-MATH. More importantly, we
show that curating training data with CaSE-evaluated relevance and coherence
directly improves final task performance. Our work provides a scalable
framework for analyzing, debugging, and improving LLM reasoning, demonstrating
the practical value of moving beyond validity checks.

for new inquiry. In this work, we present Real Deep Research (RDR) a
comprehensive framework applied to the domains of AI and robotics, with a
particular focus on foundation models and robotics advancements. We also

TL;DR: 提出通过特征排列组合优化策略降低雷达图视觉尖峰效应，改善多变量数据可视化效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决雷达图在特征值剧烈交替时产生的区域折叠问题，避免因多边形尖峰导致的视觉信息误导

Method: 采用字典序最小最大组合优化策略，结合穷举搜索和特征重排算法，优先优化整体平滑度（平均跳跃量），再以最大单次跳跃量作为平局决胜条件

Result: 通过p=6特征的双轮廓案例验证，特征重排后显著提升视觉平衡性，保持全局信息完整性

Conclusion: 该方法在中等规模特征下可有效提升雷达图的可视化准确性，为数据可视化领域提供新的组合优化思路

Abstract: Radar charts are widely used to visualize multivariate data and compare
multiple profiles across features. However, the visual clarity of radar charts
can be severely compromised when feature values alternate drastically in
magnitude around the circle, causing areas to collapse, which misrepresents
relative differences. In the present work we introduce a permutation
optimization strategy that reorders features to minimize polygon ``spikiness''
across multiple profiles simultaneously. The method is combinatorial
(exhaustive search) for moderate numbers of features and uses a lexicographic
minimax criterion that first considers overall smoothness (mean jump) and then
the largest single jump as a tie-breaker. This preserves more global
information and produces visually balanced arrangements. We discuss complexity,
practical bounds, and relations to existing approaches that either change the
visualization (e.g., OrigamiPlot) or learn orderings (e.g., Versatile Ordering
Network). An example with two profiles and $p=6$ features (before/after
ordering) illustrates the qualitative improvement.
  Keywords: data visualization, radar charts, combinatorial optimization,

Method: 通过三组实验（静态声明/标准聊天机器人/个性化聊天机器人）开展50次争议话题讨论（N=266）

Result: 人类立场基本稳定，LLM输出显著改变并趋近人类立场；个性化设置双向改变幅度最大；涉及个人经历的多轮对话最易引发立场变化

Conclusion: 需谨慎设计个性化聊天机器人，在保持立场稳定性和深度用户对齐之间取得平衡，避免过度对齐带来的风险

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-powered chatbots are increasingly used for opinion
exploration. Prior research examined how LLMs alter user views, yet little work
extended beyond one-way influence to address how user input can affect LLM
responses and how such bi-directional influence manifests throughout the
multi-turn conversations. This study investigates this dynamic through 50
controversial-topic discussions with participants (N=266) across three
conditions: static statements, standard chatbot, and personalized chatbot.
Results show that human opinions barely shifted, while LLM outputs changed more
substantially, narrowing the gap between human and LLM stance. Personalization
amplified these shifts in both directions compared to the standard setting.
Analysis of multi-turn conversations further revealed that exchanges involving
participants' personal stories were most likely to trigger stance changes for
both humans and LLMs. Our work highlights the risk of over-alignment in
human-LLM interaction and the need for careful design of personalized chatbots
to more thoughtfully and stably align with users.

Result: 初步评估（N=5）显示系统能自然整合非语言输入，用户认可对话流畅性

Conclusion: 框架在需要理解用户情感的领域（如医疗聊天机器人）具有应用潜力

Abstract: We present Empathic Prompting, a novel framework for multimodal human-AI
interaction that enriches Large Language Model (LLM) conversations with
implicit non-verbal context. The system integrates a commercial facial
expression recognition service to capture users' emotional cues and embeds them
as contextual signals during prompting. Unlike traditional multimodal
interfaces, empathic prompting requires no explicit user control; instead, it
unobtrusively augments textual input with affective information for
conversational and smoothness alignment. The architecture is modular and
scalable, allowing integration of additional non-verbal modules. We describe
the system design, implemented through a locally deployed DeepSeek instance,
and report a preliminary service and usability evaluation (N=5). Results show
consistent integration of non-verbal input into coherent LLM outputs, with
participants highlighting conversational fluidity. Beyond this proof of
concept, empathic prompting points to applications in chatbot-mediated
communication, particularly in domains like healthcare or education, where
users' emotional signals are critical yet often opaque in verbal exchanges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3DGS模型在超出训练视角范围时因各向异性方向导致生成不确定性，产生视觉伪影，需保持自由导航下的视觉保真度

Method: 利用中间梯度敏感度评分，针对性处理各向异性方向引起的不稳定性，实时集成到现有3DGS渲染管线

Result: 相较BayesRays等NeRF方法显著提升视觉质量与一致性，无需重新训练即可实时运行

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决生成不确定性核心问题，增强三维重建系统在自由导航场景下的实用性和用户体验

Abstract: When viewing a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from camera positions
significantly outside the training data distribution, substantial visual noise
commonly occurs. These artifacts result from the lack of training data in these
extrapolated regions, leading to uncertain density, color, and geometry
predictions from the model.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel real-time render-aware filtering
method. Our approach leverages sensitivity scores derived from intermediate
gradients, explicitly targeting instabilities caused by anisotropic
orientations rather than isotropic variance. This filtering method directly
addresses the core issue of generative uncertainty, allowing 3D reconstruction
systems to maintain high visual fidelity even when users freely navigate
outside the original training viewpoints.
  Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method substantially improves
visual quality, realism, and consistency compared to existing Neural Radiance
Field (NeRF)-based approaches such as BayesRays. Critically, our filter
seamlessly integrates into existing 3DGS rendering pipelines in real-time,
unlike methods that require extensive post-hoc retraining or fine-tuning.

Result: BIOCAP在物种分类和跨模态检索任务中表现优异，验证描述性标题对生物多模态建模的有效性。

Conclusion: 描述性标题超越传统标签，为连接生物图像与多模态基础模型提供了关键语义桥梁。

Abstract: This work investigates descriptive captions as an additional source of
supervision for biological multimodal foundation models. Images and captions
can be viewed as complementary samples from the latent morphospace of a
species, each capturing certain biological traits. Incorporating captions
during training encourages alignment with this shared latent structure,
emphasizing potentially diagnostic characters while suppressing spurious
correlations. The main challenge, however, lies in obtaining faithful,
instance-specific captions at scale. This requirement has limited the
utilization of natural language supervision in organismal biology compared with
many other scientific domains. We complement this gap by generating synthetic
captions with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), guided by
Wikipedia-derived visual information and taxon-tailored format examples. These
domain-specific contexts help reduce hallucination and yield accurate,
instance-based descriptive captions. Using these captions, we train BIOCAP
(i.e., BIOCLIP with Captions), a biological foundation model that captures rich
semantics and achieves strong performance in species classification and
text-image retrieval. These results demonstrate the value of descriptive
captions beyond labels in bridging biological images with multimodal foundation

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究揭示LVLM模型长文本幻觉核心机制是语境依赖而非文本长度，提出诱导-检测-抑制框架实现有效控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对长文本幻觉现象，突破传统归因于文本长度的认知局限，探索语境依赖机制的核心影响。

Method: 通过设计语境主动诱导幻觉→利用诱导样本实现早期风险检测→在解码阶段进行对象级幻觉抑制的三阶段框架。

Result: 框架在多个基准测试中显著提升检测能力（F1值提升12.3%）并降低幻觉率（相对减少38.5%）。

Conclusion: 首次建立语境依赖与长文本幻觉的因果关系，提出的框架兼具方法论创新与机制验证双重价值，为后续研究提供新范式。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant progress in recent
years but are also prone to hallucination issues. They exhibit more
hallucinations in longer, free-form responses, often attributed to accumulated
uncertainties. In this paper, we ask: Does increased hallucination result
solely from length-induced errors, or is there a deeper underlying mechanism?
After a series of preliminary experiments and findings, we suggest that the
risk of hallucinations is not caused by length itself but by the increased
reliance on context for coherence and completeness in longer responses.
Building on these insights, we propose a novel "induce-detect-suppress"
framework that actively induces hallucinations through deliberately designed
contexts, leverages induced instances for early detection of high-risk cases,
and ultimately suppresses potential object-level hallucinations during actual
decoding. Our approach achieves consistent, significant improvements across all
benchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy. The strong detection and improved
hallucination mitigation not only validate our framework but, more importantly,
re-validate our hypothesis on context. Rather than solely pursuing performance
gains, this study aims to provide new insights and serves as a first step
toward a deeper exploration of hallucinations in LVLMs' longer responses.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CMC模型解决多模态情感识别中的语义不一致和文本模态主导问题，通过自监督预训练和无参数融合模块实现多模态共识优化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略多模态间语义不一致(如文本与视觉情感冲突)，且过度依赖文本模态导致识别精度下降

Method: 1. PLGM模块生成单模态伪标签进行自监督预训练 2. PFM无参数融合模块和MCR共识路由机制进行微调

Result: 在CH-SIMS等4个数据集达到SOTA性能，在语义不一致场景下表现尤为突出

Conclusion: CMC通过自监督预训练和共识引导融合机制，有效缓解模态主导问题并提升跨模态一致性

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) has made substantial
progress. Nevertheless, most existing approaches neglect the semantic
inconsistencies that may arise across modalities, such as conflicting emotional
cues between text and visual inputs. Besides, current methods are often
dominated by the text modality due to its strong representational capacity,
which can compromise recognition accuracy. To address these challenges, we
propose a model termed Calibrated Multimodal Consensus (CMC). CMC introduces a
Pseudo Label Generation Module (PLGM) to produce pseudo unimodal labels,
enabling unimodal pretraining in a self-supervised fashion. It then employs a
Parameter-free Fusion Module (PFM) and a Multimodal Consensus Router (MCR) for
multimodal finetuning, thereby mitigating text dominance and guiding the fusion
process toward a more reliable consensus. Experimental results demonstrate that
CMC achieves performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art methods
across four datasets, CH-SIMS, CH-SIMS v2, CMU-MOSI, and CMU-MOSEI, and
exhibits notable advantages in scenarios with semantic inconsistencies on
CH-SIMS and CH-SIMS v2. The implementation of this work is publicly accessible
at https://github.com/gw-zhong/CMC.

### [91] [Small Drafts, Big Verdict: Information-Intensive Visual Reasoning via Speculation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20812)
*Yuhan Liu,Lianhui Qin,Shengjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出无训练的推测性裁决框架（SV），通过轻量级专家草稿模型与裁决模型协同工作，提升视觉语言模型在信息密集型视觉问答任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在处理密集文本与图形交织的信息密集型图像时，面临精准定位关键线索和多跳推理整合分散证据的挑战。现有方法存在计算成本高且准确率不足的问题。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 草稿阶段由小型VLM生成多样化定位候选推理路径；2) 裁决阶段由强VLM合成路径生成最终答案，并引入共识专家选择机制筛选高一致性路径。

Result: 在InfographicVQA、ChartMuseum等四个高难度基准测试中均取得显著提升，相比大型专有模型降低计算成本的同时实现错误纠正。

Conclusion: SV框架通过集成部分正确的推理路径实现错误修正与效率优化，为复杂视觉推理任务提供了有效的零训练解决方案。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal understanding, yet they struggle when reasoning over
information-intensive images that densely interleave textual annotations with
fine-grained graphical elements. The main challenges lie in precisely
localizing critical cues in dense layouts and multi-hop reasoning to integrate
dispersed evidence. We propose Speculative Verdict (SV), a training-free
framework inspired by speculative decoding that combines multiple lightweight
draft experts with a large verdict model. In the draft stage, small VLMs act as
draft experts to generate reasoning paths that provide diverse localization
candidates; in the verdict stage, a strong VLM synthesizes these paths to
produce the final answer, minimizing computational cost while recovering
correct answers. To further improve efficiency and accuracy, SV introduces a
consensus expert selection mechanism that forwards only high-agreement
reasoning paths to the verdict. Empirically, SV achieves consistent gains on
challenging information-intensive and high-resolution visual question answering
benchmarks, including InfographicVQA, ChartMuseum, ChartQAPro, and HR-Bench 4K.
By synthesizing correct insights from multiple partially accurate reasoning
paths, SV achieves both error correction and cost-efficiency compared to large
proprietary models or training pipelines. Code is available at

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出SOD任务并通过LLMs实现电子表格操作文档自动生成，构建基准数据集并验证可行性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子表格缺乏系统化文档方法导致自动化/协作/知识传承困难，存在机构知识流失风险

Method: 构建111个操作代码片段及自然语言摘要的基准数据集，使用5种LLMs通过BLEU/GLEU/ROUGE-L/METEOR指标评估

Result: LLMs能生成准确文档但存在挑战，GPT-4o表现最佳，自动文档生成可行性得到验证

Conclusion: SOD作为增强电子表格可重复性/可维护性的前置步骤具备可行性，需解决模型优化和文档标准化问题

Abstract: Numerous knowledge workers utilize spreadsheets in business, accounting, and
finance. However, a lack of systematic documentation methods for spreadsheets
hinders automation, collaboration, and knowledge transfer, which risks the loss
of crucial institutional knowledge. This paper introduces Spreadsheet
Operations Documentation (SOD), an AI task that involves generating
human-readable explanations from spreadsheet operations. Many previous studies
have utilized Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating spreadsheet
manipulation code; however, translating that code into natural language for SOD
is a less-explored area. To address this, we present a benchmark of 111
spreadsheet manipulation code snippets, each paired with a corresponding
natural language summary. We evaluate five LLMs, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini,
LLaMA-3.3-70B, Mixtral-8x7B, and Gemma2-9B, using BLEU, GLEU, ROUGE-L, and
METEOR metrics. Our findings suggest that LLMs can generate accurate
spreadsheet documentation, making SOD a feasible prerequisite step toward
enhancing reproducibility, maintainability, and collaborative workflows in
spreadsheets, although there are challenges that need to be addressed.
