However, the role of prompt\nspecificity, especially in domains like STEM (physics, chemistry, biology,\ncomputer science and mathematics), medicine, and law, remains underexplored.\nThis thesis addresses the problem of whether increasing the specificity of\nvocabulary in prompts improves LLM performance in domain-specific\nquestion-answering and reasoning tasks. We developed a synonymization framework\nto systematically substitute nouns, verbs, and adjectives with varying\nspecificity levels, measuring the impact on four LLMs: Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct,\nGranite-13B-Instruct-V2, Flan-T5-XL, and Mistral-Large 2, across datasets in\nSTEM, law, and medicine. Our results reveal that while generally increasing the\nspecificity of prompts does not have a significant impact, there appears to be\na specificity range, across all considered models, where the LLM performs the\nbest. Identifying this optimal specificity range offers a key insight for\nprompt design, suggesting that manipulating prompts within this range could\nmaximize LLM performance and lead to more efficient applications in specialized\ndomains."}

The results show\nthat (1) LLMs from all model families are stable, such that their responses are\nsemantically consistent despite being written in various ways, and (2) most of\nthe LLMs generated notes close to the corresponding notes made by experts.\nOverall, Meta's Llama 70B was the most reliable, followed by Mistral's Small\nmodel. With these findings, we recommend the local deployment of these\nrelatively smaller open-weight models for CNG to ensure compliance with data\nprivacy regulations, as well as to improve the efficiency of HCPs in clinical\ndocumentation."}

We consider two simple decoding strategies motivated by the shallow\nreward signal observation, namely Length Control Decoding and KL Threshold\nControl Decoding, which leverage shallow preference signals to optimize the\ntrade-off between alignment and computational efficiency. The performance is\neven better, which again validates our hypothesis.\n  The phenomenon of shallow preference signals highlights potential issues in\nLLM alignment: existing alignment methods often focus on aligning only the\ninitial tokens of responses, rather than considering the full response.

Despite their significant\nbenefits, the tendency of LLMs to hallucinate in such domains can have severe\nconsequences in applications such as energy, nature, finance, healthcare,\nretail and transportation, among others. To guarantee prediction reliability\nand accuracy in numerical domains, it is necessary to open the black-box and\nprovide performance guarantees through explanation.

This paper seeks to bridge this gap by understanding\nwhen the next-word prediction capability of LLMs can be adapted to numerical\ndomains through a novel analysis based on the concept of isotropy in the\ncontextual embedding space. Specifically, we consider a log-linear model for\nLLMs in which numeric data can be predicted from its context through a network\nwith softmax in the output layer of LLMs (i.e., language model head in\nself-attention). We demonstrate that, in order to achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance in numerical domains, the hidden representations of the LLM\nembeddings must possess a structure that accounts for the shift-invariance of\nthe softmax function. By formulating a gradient structure of self-attention in\npre-trained models, we show how the isotropic property of LLM embeddings in\ncontextual embedding space preserves the underlying structure of\nrepresentations, thereby resolving the shift-invariance problem and providing a\nperformance guarantee.

This variation often reflects\nreasonable differences in semantic interpretations rather than mere noise,\nnecessitating methods to distinguish between legitimate subjectivity and error.\nWe address this challenge by exploring label verification in these contexts\nusing Large Language Models (LLMs). First, we propose a simple In-Context\nLearning binary filtering baseline that estimates the reasonableness of a\ndocument-label pair. We then introduce the Label-in-a-Haystack setting: the\nquery and its label(s) are included in the demonstrations shown to LLMs, which\nare prompted to predict the label(s) again, while receiving task-specific\ninstructions (e.g., emotion recognition) rather than label copying. We show how\nthe failure to copy the label(s) to the output of the LLM are task-relevant and\ninformative. Building on this, we propose the Label-in-a-Haystack Rectification\n(LiaHR) framework for subjective label correction: when the model outputs\ndiverge from the reference gold labels, we assign the generated labels to the\nexample instead of discarding it. This approach can be integrated into\nannotation pipelines to enhance signal-to-noise ratios.

It also introduces a\ntailored evaluation methodology to comprehensively assess model performance in\nthese critical areas. Our evaluation shows that even advanced LLMs struggle to\nperform consistently across these dimensions, underscoring key areas for\nimprovement. We release CReSt to support further research and the development\nof more robust RAG systems. The dataset and code are available at:\nhttps://github.com/UpstageAI/CReSt."}

Despite their\nsuccess, next-token prediction (NTP), the dominant method for LLM training and\ninference, is constrained in both contextual coverage and inference efficiency\ndue to its inherently sequential process. To overcome these challenges, we\npropose leap multi-token prediction~(L-MTP), an innovative token prediction\nmethod that extends the capabilities of multi-token prediction (MTP) by\nintroducing a leap-based mechanism. Unlike conventional MTP, which generates\nmultiple tokens at adjacent positions, L-MTP strategically skips over\nintermediate tokens, predicting non-sequential ones in a single forward pass.\nThis structured leap not only enhances the model's ability to capture\nlong-range dependencies but also enables a decoding strategy specially\noptimized for non-sequential leap token generation, effectively accelerating\ninference.

We introduce CLUE\n(Conflict-and-Agreement-aware Language-model Uncertainty Explanations), the\nfirst framework to generate natural language explanations of model uncertainty\nby (i) identifying relationships between spans of text that expose\nclaim-evidence or inter-evidence conflicts and agreements that drive the\nmodel's predictive uncertainty in an unsupervised way, and (ii) generating\nexplanations via prompting and attention steering that verbalize these critical\ninteractions.

In this work, we propose a practical and scalable alternative:\ncomposing efficient hybrid language models from existing pre-trained models.\nOur approach, Zebra-Llama, introduces a family of 1B, 3B, and 8B hybrid models\nby combining State Space Models (SSMs) and Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA)\nlayers, using a refined initialization and post-training pipeline to\nefficiently transfer knowledge from pre-trained Transformers. Zebra-Llama\nachieves Transformer-level accuracy with near-SSM efficiency using only 7-11B\ntraining tokens (compared to trillions of tokens required for pre-training) and\nan 8B teacher. Moreover, Zebra-Llama dramatically reduces KV cache size -down\nto 3.9%, 2%, and 2.73% of the original for the 1B, 3B, and 8B variants,\nrespectively-while preserving 100%, 100%, and >97% of average zero-shot\nperformance on LM Harness tasks. Compared to models like MambaInLLaMA,\nX-EcoMLA, Minitron, and Llamba, Zebra-Llama consistently delivers competitive\nor superior accuracy while using significantly fewer tokens, smaller teachers,\nand vastly reduced KV cache memory.

SPEX greatly improves upon prior methods but requires\ntens of thousands of model inferences, which can be prohibitive for large\nmodels. In this paper, we observe that LLM feature interactions are often\nhierarchical -- higher-order interactions are accompanied by their lower-order\nsubsets -- which enables more efficient discovery. To exploit this hierarchy,\nwe propose ProxySPEX, an interaction attribution algorithm that first fits\ngradient boosted trees to masked LLM outputs and then extracts the important\ninteractions. Experiments across four challenging high-dimensional datasets\nshow that ProxySPEX more faithfully reconstructs LLM outputs by 20% over\nmarginal attribution approaches while using $10\\times$ fewer inferences than\nSPEX. By accounting for interactions, ProxySPEX identifies features that\ninfluence model output over 20% more than those selected by marginal\napproaches. Further, we apply ProxySPEX to two interpretability tasks. Data\nattribution, where we identify interactions among CIFAR-10 training samples\nthat influence test predictions, and mechanistic interpretability, where we\nuncover interactions between attention heads, both within and across layers, on\na question-answering task. ProxySPEX identifies interactions that enable more\naggressive pruning of heads than marginal approaches."}

To\naddress these issues, we explore the full automation pipeline within the online\nrecommendation service of a company with nearly 400 million daily active users,\nanalyzing industry-grade C++ codebases comprising hundreds of thousands of\nlines of code. We identify four key challenges: 1) capturing relevant context,\n2) improving key bug inclusion (KBI), 3) reducing false alarm rates (FAR), and\n4) integrating human workflows. To tackle these, we propose 1) code slicing\nalgorithms for context extraction, 2) a multi-role LLM framework for KBI, 3) a\nfiltering mechanism for FAR reduction, and 4) a novel prompt design for better\nhuman interaction.

A prerequisite for this vision is understanding how well\nan AI model can identify the underlying structure of a black-box system from\nits behavior. In this paper, we explore how well a large language model (LLM)\nlearns to identify a black-box function from passively observed versus actively\ncollected data. We investigate the reverse-engineering capabilities of LLMs\nacross three distinct types of black-box systems, each chosen to represent\ndifferent problem domains where future autonomous AI researchers may have\nconsiderable impact: Program, Formal Language, and Math Equation. Through\nextensive experiments, we show that LLMs fail to extract information from\nobservations, reaching a performance plateau that falls short of the ideal of\nBayesian inference. However, we demonstrate that prompting LLMs to not only\nobserve but also intervene -- actively querying the black-box with specific\ninputs to observe the resulting output -- improves performance by allowing LLMs\nto test edge cases and refine their beliefs. By providing the intervention data\nfrom one LLM to another, we show that this improvement is partly a result of\nengaging in the process of generating effective interventions, paralleling\nresults in the literature on human learning. Further analysis reveals that\nengaging in intervention can help LLMs escape from two common failure modes:\novercomplication, where the LLM falsely assumes prior knowledge about the\nblack-box, and overlooking, where the LLM fails to incorporate observations.\nThese insights provide practical guidance for helping LLMs more effectively\nreverse-engineer black-box systems, supporting their use in making new\ndiscoveries."}

Through\ncontrolled experiments on a synthetic biography dataset mixed with web-scraped\ndata, we demonstrate that: (1) as we increase the model size to a critical\nvalue, the model suddenly transitions from memorizing very few to most of the\nbiographies; (2) below a critical mixing ratio, the model memorizes almost\nnothing even with extensive training, but beyond this threshold, it rapidly\nmemorizes more biographies. We attribute these phase transitions to a capacity\nallocation phenomenon: a model with bounded capacity must act like a knapsack\nproblem solver to minimize the overall test loss, and the optimal allocation\nacross datasets can change discontinuously as the model size or mixing ratio\nvaries.
