Previous work has shown that LLMs are\nlinguistically overconfident in English, leading users to overrely on confident\ngenerations. However, the usage and interpretation of epistemic markers (e.g.,\n'It's definitely,' 'I think') can differ sharply across languages. Here, we\nstudy the risks of multilingual linguistic (mis)calibration, overconfidence,\nand overreliance across five languages to evaluate the safety of LLMs in a\nglobal context.\n  We find that overreliance risks are high across all languages. We first\nanalyze the distribution of LLM-generated epistemic markers, and observe that\nwhile LLMs are cross-linguistically overconfident, they are also sensitive to\ndocumented linguistic variation. For example, models generate the most markers\nof uncertainty in Japanese and the most markers of certainty in German and\nMandarin. We then measure human reliance rates across languages, finding that\nwhile users strongly rely on confident LLM generations in all languages,\nreliance behaviors differ cross-linguistically: for example, users rely\nsignificantly more on expressions of uncertainty in Japanese than in English.\nTaken together, these results indicate high risk of reliance on overconfident\nmodel generations across languages.

ETT enable the extension of the\ncontext length at test-time by efficient fine-tuning the model's parameters on\nthe input context, chunked into overlapping small subsequences. We evaluate ETT\non LongBench by extending the context length of GPT-Large and Phi-2 up to 32\ntimes, increasing from 1k to 32k tokens. This results in up to a 30 percent\nimprovement in the model's accuracy. We also study how context can be stored in\nLLM's weights effectively and efficiently.

Previous research shows that using\ntest-time learning to encode context directly into model parameters can\neffectively enable reasoning over noisy information.

In this work, we propose\nPERK (Parameter Efficient Reasoning over Knowledge), a scalable approach for\nlearning to encode long input contexts using gradient updates to a lightweight\nmodel adapter at test time. Specifically, PERK employs two nested optimization\nloops in a meta-training phase. The inner loop rapidly encodes contexts into a\nlow-rank adapter (LoRA) that serves as a parameter-efficient memory module for\nthe base model. Concurrently, the outer loop learns to use the updated adapter\nto accurately recall and reason over relevant information from the encoded long\ncontext. Our evaluations on several long-context reasoning tasks show that PERK\nsignificantly outperforms the standard prompt-based long-context baseline,\nachieving average absolute performance gains of up to 90% for smaller models\n(GPT-2) and up to 27% for our largest evaluated model, Qwen-2.5-0.5B.

In particular, we observe that a major\nsource of error in current multimodal reasoning lies in the perception of\nvisual inputs. To address this bottleneck, we propose Perception-Aware Policy\nOptimization (PAPO), a simple yet effective extension of GRPO that encourages\nthe model to learn to perceive while learning to reason, entirely from internal\nsupervision signals. Notably, PAPO does not rely on additional data curation,\nexternal reward models, or proprietary models. Specifically, we introduce the\nImplicit Perception Loss in the form of a KL divergence term to the GRPO\nobjective, which, despite its simplicity, yields significant overall\nimprovements (4.4%) on diverse multimodal benchmarks. The improvements are more\npronounced, approaching 8.0%, on tasks with high vision dependency. We also\nobserve a substantial reduction (30.5%) in perception errors, indicating\nimproved perceptual capabilities with PAPO. We conduct comprehensive analysis\nof PAPO and identify a unique loss hacking issue, which we rigorously analyze\nand mitigate through a Double Entropy Loss. Overall, our work introduces a\ndeeper integration of perception-aware supervision into RLVR learning\nobjectives and lays the groundwork for a new RL framework that encourages\nvisually grounded reasoning.

A general mathematical model of discursive networks is developed to\nprovide valuable insights: A network governed only by drift and self-repair\nstabilizes at a modest error rate; adding fabrication reproduces the high rates\nseen in current LLMs. Giving each false claim even a small chance of peer\nreview shifts the system to a truth-dominant state. We operationalize peer\nreview with the open-source \\emph{Flaws-of-Others (FOO) algorithm}: a\nconfigurable loop in which any set of agents critique one another while a\nharmoniser merges their verdicts.

In this work, we propose a\nset-wise passage selection approach and introduce SETR, which explicitly\nidentifies the information requirements of a query through Chain-of-Thought\nreasoning and selects an optimal set of passages that collectively satisfy\nthose requirements. Experiments on multi-hop RAG benchmarks show that SETR\noutperforms both proprietary LLM-based rerankers and open-source baselines in\nterms of answer correctness and retrieval quality, providing an effective and\nefficient alternative to traditional rerankers in RAG systems.

However, their close integration with personal devices\nraises significant security concerns, with many threats, including backdoor\nattacks, remaining largely unexplored. This work reveals that the visual\ngrounding of GUI agent-mapping textual plans to GUI elements-can introduce\nvulnerabilities, enabling new types of backdoor attacks. With backdoor attack\ntargeting visual grounding, the agent's behavior can be compromised even when\ngiven correct task-solving plans. To validate this vulnerability, we propose\nVisualTrap, a method that can hijack the grounding by misleading the agent to\nlocate textual plans to trigger locations instead of the intended targets.\nVisualTrap uses the common method of injecting poisoned data for attacks, and\ndoes so during the pre-training of visual grounding to ensure practical\nfeasibility of attacking. Empirical results show that VisualTrap can\neffectively hijack visual grounding with as little as 5% poisoned data and\nhighly stealthy visual triggers (invisible to the human eye); and the attack\ncan be generalized to downstream tasks, even after clean fine-tuning.
