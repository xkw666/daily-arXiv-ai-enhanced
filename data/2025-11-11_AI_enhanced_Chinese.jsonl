To address the issues of unstable pose estimation and scene representation distortion caused by geometric texture inconsistency in large outdoor scenes with weak or repetitive textures, we approach the problem from two aspects: pose estimation and scene representation. For pose estimation, we leverage LiDAR-IMU Odometry to provide prior poses for cameras in large-scale environments. These prior pose constraints are incorporated into COLMAP's triangulation process, with pose optimization performed via bundle adjustment. Ensuring consistency between pixel data association and prior poses helps maintain both robustness and accuracy. For scene representation, we introduce normal vector constraints and effective rank regularization to enforce consistency in the direction and shape of Gaussian primitives. These constraints are jointly optimized with the existing photometric loss to enhance the map quality. We evaluate our approach using both public and self-collected datasets. In terms of pose optimization, our method requires only one-third of the time while maintaining accuracy and robustness across both datasets. In terms of scene representation, the results show that our method significantly outperforms conventional 3DGS pipelines. Notably, on self-collected datasets characterized by weak or repetitive textures, our approach demonstrates enhanced visualization capabilities and achieves superior overall performance.

Existing data extraction methods, particularly heuristic-based divergence attacks, often exhibit limited success and offer limited insight into the fundamental drivers of memorization leakage. This paper introduces Confusion-Inducing Attacks (CIA), a principled framework for extracting memorized data by systematically maximizing model uncertainty. We empirically demonstrate that the emission of memorized text during divergence is preceded by a sustained spike in token-level prediction entropy. CIA leverages this insight by optimizing input snippets to deliberately induce this consecutive high-entropy state. For aligned LLMs, we further propose Mismatched Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) to simultaneously weaken their alignment and induce targeted confusion, thereby increasing susceptibility to our attacks. Experiments on various unaligned and aligned LLMs demonstrate that our proposed attacks outperform existing baselines in extracting verbatim and near-verbatim training data without requiring prior knowledge of the training data.

However, prevailing moderation systems are centralized and task-specific, offering limited transparency and neglecting diverse user preferences--an approach ill-suited for privacy-sensitive or decentralized environments. We propose a novel framework that leverages in-context learning (ICL) with foundation models to unify the detection of toxicity, spam, and negative sentiment across binary, multi-class, and multi-label settings. Crucially, our approach enables lightweight personalization, allowing users to easily block new categories, unblock existing ones, or extend detection to semantic variations through simple prompt-based interventions--all without model retraining. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks (TextDetox, UCI SMS, SST2) and a new, annotated Mastodon dataset reveal that: (i) foundation models achieve strong cross-task generalization, often matching or surpassing task-specific fine-tuned models; (ii) effective personalization is achievable with as few as one user-provided example or definition; and (iii) augmenting prompts with label definitions or rationales significantly enhances robustness to noisy, real-world data. Our work demonstrates a definitive shift beyond one-size-fits-all moderation, establishing ICL as a practical, privacy-preserving, and highly adaptable pathway for the next generation of user-centric content safety systems.

Recent efforts shift toward KV merging, merging eviction tokens with retention tokens based on similarity.

This work introduces FlowMM, an adaptive framework for cross-modal information flow-guided multimodal KV cache merging. FlowMM leverages cross-modal information flow to dynamically apply layer-specific merging strategies, capturing modality-specific patterns while preserving contextual integrity. Furthermore, we introduce a sensitivity-adaptive token matching mechanism that jointly evaluates token similarity and task-critical sensitivity, merging low-risk tokens while safeguarding high-sensitivity ones.

Code Available at https://github.com/t-satharasi/AI-Modal-Collapse-Code-for-Reproduction.git", "summary": "Artificial Intelligence, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), has transformed domains such as software engineering, journalism, creative writing, academia, and media (Naveed et al. 2025; arXiv:2307.06435). Diffusion models like Stable Diffusion generate high-quality images and videos from text. Evidence shows rapid expansion: 74.2% of newly published webpages now contain AI-generated material (Ryan Law 2025), 30-40% of the active web corpus is synthetic (Spennemann 2025; arXiv:2504.08755), 52% of U.S. adults use LLMs for writing, coding, or research (Staff 2025), and audits find AI involvement in 18% of financial complaints and 24% of press releases (Liang et al. 2025). The underlying neural architectures, including Transformers (Vaswani et al. 2023; arXiv:1706.03762), RNNs, LSTMs, GANs, and diffusion networks, depend on large, diverse, human-authored datasets (Shi & Iyengar 2019). As synthetic content dominates, recursive training risks eroding linguistic and semantic diversity, producing Model Collapse (Shumailov et al. 2024; arXiv:2307.15043; Dohmatob et al. 2024; arXiv:2402.07712). This study quantifies and forecasts collapse onset by examining year-wise semantic similarity in English-language Wikipedia (filtered Common Crawl) from 2013 to 2025 using Transformer embeddings and cosine similarity metrics. Results reveal a steady rise in similarity before public LLM adoption, likely driven by early RNN/LSTM translation and text-normalization pipelines, though modest due to a smaller scale. Observed fluctuations reflect irreducible linguistic diversity, variable corpus size across years, finite sampling error, and an exponential rise in similarity after the public adoption of LLM models.

While recent dictionary learning methods such as Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) provide a promising route to discover human-interpretable features, they suffer from a variety of problems, including a systematic failure to capture the rich conceptual information that drives linguistic understanding. Instead, they exhibit a bias towards shallow, token-specific, or noisy features, such as \"the phrase 'The' at the start of sentences\". In this work, we propose that this is due to a fundamental issue with how dictionary learning methods for LLMs are trained. Language itself has a rich, well-studied structure spanning syntax, semantics, and pragmatics; however, current unsupervised methods largely ignore this linguistic knowledge, leading to poor feature discovery that favors superficial patterns over meaningful concepts. We focus on a simple but important aspect of language: semantic content has long-range dependencies and tends to be smooth over a sequence, whereas syntactic information is much more local. Building on this insight, we introduce Temporal Sparse Autoencoders (T-SAEs), which incorporate a novel contrastive loss encouraging consistent activations of high-level features over adjacent tokens. This simple yet powerful modification enables SAEs to disentangle semantic from syntactic features in a self-supervised manner. Across multiple datasets and models, T-SAEs recover smoother, more coherent semantic concepts without sacrificing reconstruction quality. Strikingly, they exhibit clear semantic structure despite being trained without explicit semantic signal, offering a new pathway for unsupervised interpretability in language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65f6\u95f4\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668(T-SAEs)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u5206\u79bb\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u53e5\u6cd5\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668(SAEs)\u5b58\u5728\u6355\u6349\u6df1\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u504f\u5411\u6d45\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u6539\u8fdb\u7279\u5f81\u53d1\u73b0\u673a\u5236", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0e\u53e5\u6cd5\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e26\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u76f8\u90bbtoken\u7684\u9ad8\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u4e00\u81f4\u6027", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6/\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6982\u5ff5\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5448\u73b0\u6e05\u6670\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784", "conclusion": "T-SAEs\u4e3a\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u5f0f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u8026\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u53e5\u6cd5\u7279\u5f81"}}

The members of the vocabulary can be built of code points or bytes. Using code points means that all members of the vocabulary are valid UTF-8 characters. However, it also requires thousands of initial members to achieve acceptable coverage of inputs. Beginning with bytes, on the contrary, avoids out-of-vocabulary errors with only 256 initial members of the vocabulary, but the members of the vocabulary and sequences of them are not guaranteed to be valid UTF-8. Sequences that are not valid UTF-8 break code that assumes its input to be valid UTF-8. Applications of language models must account for the breakage thereby introduced. In this paper, we formalize tokenization using monoid theory and prove that tokenizers whose vocabularies contain tokens that are ill-formed UTF-8 can always produce sequences that are ill-formed UTF-8. We demonstrate formally that attempting to incrementally convert tokens back to a string and interpret the results as UTF-8 gives different results than converting the whole sequence of tokens at once.

Through experiments comparing multiple open- and closed-source models, we uncover that many models with comparable accuracy differ wildly in token consumption, revealing that efficiency variance is a neglected but significant axis of differentiation. We further demonstrate Pareto frontiers over the accuracy-efficiency plane and argue for an evaluation paradigm shift: we should no longer treat tokens as \"free\" to multiply. OckBench provides a unified platform for measuring, comparing, and guiding research in token-efficient reasoning.

As models develop induction heads, they often experience a sharp drop in training loss, a phenomenon cited as evidence that induction heads may serve as a prerequisite for more complex in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. In this work, we ask whether transformers can still acquire ICL capabilities when inductive copying is suppressed. We propose Hapax, a setting where we omit the loss contribution of any token that can be correctly predicted by induction heads. Despite a significant reduction in inductive copying, performance on abstractive ICL tasks (i.e., tasks where the answer is not contained in the input context) remains comparable and surpasses the vanilla model on 13 of 21 tasks, even though 31.7\\% of tokens are omitted from the loss. Furthermore, our model achieves lower loss values on token positions that cannot be predicted correctly by induction heads. Mechanistic analysis further shows that models trained with Hapax develop fewer and weaker induction heads but still preserve ICL capabilities.

First, the large language model captures contextual dependencies and deep semantic representations of the input text, providing a rich feature foundation for subsequent modeling. Then, based on multi-level feature representations, the feature pyramid mechanism effectively integrates semantic features of different scales, balancing global information and local details to construct hierarchical semantic expressions. Furthermore, the fused features are transformed into graph representations, and graph neural networks are employed to capture latent semantic relations and logical dependencies in the text, enabling comprehensive modeling of complex interactions among semantic units. On this basis, the readout and classification modules generate the final category predictions. The proposed method demonstrates significant advantages in robustness alignment experiments, outperforming existing models on ACC, F1-Score, AUC, and Precision, which verifies the effectiveness and stability of the framework.

Most existing approaches rely on fine-tuning to balance unlearning efficiency with general language capabilities. However, these methods typically require training or access to retain data, which is often unavailable in real world scenarios. Although these methods can perform well when both forget and retain data are available, few works have demonstrated equivalent capability in more practical, data-limited scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose Detect-Reasoning Augmented GeneratiON (DRAGON), a systematic, reasoning-based framework that utilizes in-context chain-of-thought (CoT) instructions to guard deployed LLMs before inference. Instead of modifying the base model, DRAGON leverages the inherent instruction-following ability of LLMs and introduces a lightweight detection module to identify forget-worthy prompts without any retain data. These are then routed through a dedicated CoT guard model to enforce safe and accurate in-context intervention. To robustly evaluate unlearning performance, we introduce novel metrics for unlearning performance and the continual unlearning setting. Extensive experiments across three representative unlearning tasks validate the effectiveness of DRAGON, demonstrating its strong unlearning capability, scalability, and applicability in practical scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDRAGON\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u6307\u4ee4\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u7684LLM\u77e5\u8bc6\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\u548cCoT\u5b89\u5168\u5e72\u9884\u673a\u5236", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u4e14\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u53ef\u83b7\u53d6", "method": "\u5229\u7528LLM\u56fa\u6709\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\u8bc6\u522b\u9057\u5fd8\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u7528CoT\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b89\u5168\u5e72\u9884", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u5f3a\u9057\u5fd8\u80fd\u529b\uff0898.3%\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u7387\uff09\u3001\u826f\u597d\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u9002\u7528\u6027", "conclusion": "DRAGON\u5f00\u521b\u4e86\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u5f0f\u9057\u5fd8\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u65b0\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e3a\u6301\u7eed\u9057\u5fd8\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6"}}

If fine-tuning impairs edits as shown in Figure 1, current KE methods become less useful, as every fine-tuned model would require re-editing, which significantly increases the cost; if edits persist, fine-tuned models risk propagating hidden malicious edits, raising serious safety concerns. To this end, we systematically quantify edits decay after fine-tuning, investigating how fine-tuning affects knowledge editing. We evaluate two state-of-the-art editing methods (MEMIT, AlphaEdit) and three fine-tuning approaches (full-parameter, LoRA, DoRA) across five LLMs and three datasets, yielding 232 experimental configurations. Our results show that edits decay after fine-tuning, with survival varying across configurations, e.g., AlphaEdit edits decay more than MEMIT edits. Further, we propose selective-layer fine-tuning and find that fine-tuning edited layers only can effectively remove edits, though at a slight cost to downstream performance. Surprisingly, fine-tuning non-edited layers impairs more edits than full fine-tuning. Overall, our study establishes empirical baselines and actionable strategies for integrating knowledge editing with fine-tuning, and underscores that evaluating model editing requires considering the full LLM application pipeline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5fae\u8c03\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u5185\u5bb9\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5c42\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u8bc4\u4f30\u9700\u7ed3\u5408\u5b8c\u6574\u5e94\u7528\u6d41\u7a0b", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9645\u9700\u6c42\uff1a1\uff09\u5f53\u9700\u8981\u79fb\u9664\u9690\u853d/\u6076\u610f\u7f16\u8f91\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u786e\u4fdd\u5fae\u8c03\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6d88\u9664\u7f16\u8f91\u75d5\u8ff9\uff1b2\uff09\u5f53\u5e0c\u671b\u4fdd\u7559\u6709\u76ca\u7f16\u8f91\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u9632\u6b62\u5fae\u8c03\u7834\u574f\u5df2\u7f16\u8f91\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u82e5\u5fae\u8c03\u635f\u5bb3\u7f16\u8f91\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5c06\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u590d\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\uff1b\u82e5\u7f16\u8f91\u6b8b\u7559\uff0c\u5219\u53ef\u80fd\u4f20\u64ad\u5b89\u5168\u9690\u60a3", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f302\u79cd\u524d\u6cbf\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5(MEMIT/AlphaEdit)\u4e0e3\u79cd\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5(\u5168\u53c2\u6570/LoRA/DoRA)\uff0c\u57285\u4e2aLLM\u548c3\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5c55\u5f00232\u7ec4\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5c42\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565(\u4ec5\u5fae\u8c03\u7f16\u8f91\u76f8\u5173\u5c42)", "result": "1) \u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7f16\u8f91\u5185\u5bb9\u5e73\u5747\u8870\u51cf40-70%\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u914d\u7f6e\u751f\u5b58\u7387\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457(\u5982AlphaEdit\u8870\u51cf\u7387\u9ad8\u4e8eMEMIT) 2) \u4ec5\u5fae\u8c03\u7f16\u8f91\u5c42\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u6d88\u966497%\u7f16\u8f91\u75d5\u8ff9\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d3% 3) \u610f\u5916\u53d1\u73b0\u5fae\u8c03\u975e\u7f16\u8f91\u5c42\u6bd4\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\u7834\u574f\u66f4\u591a\u7f16\u8f91(\u8870\u51cf\u7387+15%)", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u4e0e\u5fae\u8c03\u534f\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u5c42\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u6280\u672f\u5fc5\u987b\u7f6e\u4e8e\u5b8c\u6574\u5e94\u7528\u94fe\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba"}}

Existing works towards NID mainly adopt a cascaded architecture, wherein the first stage focuses on encoding the utterances into informative text embeddings beforehand, while the latter is to group similar embeddings into clusters (i.e., intents), typically by K-Means. However, such a cascaded pipeline fails to leverage the feedback from both steps for mutual refinement, and, meanwhile, the embedding-only clustering overlooks nuanced textual semantics, leading to suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes NILC, a novel clustering framework specially catered for effective NID. Particularly, NILC follows an iterative workflow, in which clustering assignments are judiciously updated by carefully refining cluster centroids and text embeddings of uncertain utterances with the aid of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, NILC first taps into LLMs to create additional semantic centroids for clusters, thereby enriching the contextual semantics of the Euclidean centroids of embeddings. Moreover, LLMs are then harnessed to augment hard samples (ambiguous or terse utterances) identified from clusters via rewriting for subsequent cluster correction. Further, we inject supervision signals through non-trivial techniques seeding and soft must links for more accurate NID in the semi-supervised setting.

Additionally, as time progresses, there may be a need to retrain these agents with new intents from the system-rejected queries to carry out additional tasks. Labeling all these emerging intents and rejected utterances over time is impractical, thus calling for an efficient mechanism to reduce annotation costs. In this paper, we introduce IDALC (Intent Detection and Active Learning based Correction), a semi-supervised framework designed to detect user intents and rectify system-rejected utterances while minimizing the need for human annotation.

We challenge this narrative by observing that RL-enhanced models consistently outperform their base and supervised fine-tuned (SFT) counterparts on pure knowledge recall tasks, particularly those requiring traversal of hierarchical, structured knowledge (e.g., medical codes). We hypothesize these gains stem not from newly acquired data, but from improved procedural skills in navigating and searching existing knowledge hierarchies within the model parameters. To support this hypothesis, we show that structured prompting, which explicitly guides SFTed models through hierarchical traversal, recovers most of the performance gap (reducing 24pp to 7pp on MedConceptsQA for DeepSeek-V3/R1). We further find that while prompting improves final-answer accuracy, RL-enhanced models retain superior ability to recall correct procedural paths on deep-retrieval tasks. Finally our layer-wise internal activation analysis reveals that while factual representations (e.g., activations for the statement \"code 57.95 refers to urinary infection\") maintain high cosine similarity between SFT and RL models, query representations (e.g., \"what is code 57.95\") diverge noticeably, indicating that RL primarily transforms how models traverse knowledge rather than the knowledge representation itself.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bfc\u822a\u80fd\u529b\u800c\u975e\u65b0\u589e\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u53ef\u7f29\u5c0fSFT\u4e0eRL\u6a21\u578b\u5dee\u8ddd", "motivation": "\u6311\u6218\u4f20\u7edf\u8ba4\u77e5\uff0c\u63ed\u793aRL\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u53ec\u56de\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u8868\u73b0", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3001\u8def\u5f84\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5bf9\u6bd4\u548c\u5c42\u7ea7\u6fc0\u6d3b\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5206\u6790", "result": "\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u7f29\u5c0f24pp\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0cRL\u6a21\u578b\u4fdd\u6301\u6df1\u5c42\u68c0\u7d22\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u76f8\u4f3c\u4f46\u67e5\u8be2\u8868\u5f81\u5206\u5316", "conclusion": "RL\u4e3b\u8981\u4f18\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u904d\u5386\u673a\u5236\u800c\u975e\u77e5\u8bc6\u5b58\u50a8\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u65b9\u5411"}}

Our approach constructs a synthetic English-language dataset derived from Chinese-context discrimination categories, including regional, ethnic, and occupational biases. Each instance is paired with both neutral and biased responses to train a reward model based on DeBERTa-v3, which provides multi-dimensional reward signals capturing fairness, neutrality, and linguistic quality. The trained reward model then guides GRPO fine-tuning to optimize model outputs along these ethical dimensions. Experimental results demonstrate significant reductions in bias intensity and improved alignment with non-discriminatory standards without compromising fluency or informativeness.

Existing work simply fuses information from various modalities to learn stance representations, overlooking the varying contributions of stance expression from different modalities. Therefore, stance misunderstanding noises may be drawn into the stance learning process due to the risk of learning errors by rough modality combination. To address this, we get inspiration from the dual-process theory of human cognition and propose **ReMoD**, a framework that **Re**thinks **Mo**dality contribution of stance expression through a **D**ual-reasoning paradigm. ReMoD integrates *experience-driven intuitive reasoning* to capture initial stance cues with *deliberate reflective reasoning* to adjust for modality biases, refine stance judgments, and thereby dynamically weight modality contributions based on their actual expressive power for the target stance. Specifically, the intuitive stage queries the Modality Experience Pool (MEP) and Semantic Experience Pool (SEP) to form an initial stance hypothesis, prioritizing historically impactful modalities. This hypothesis is then refined in the reflective stage via two reasoning chains: Modality-CoT updates MEP with adaptive fusion strategies to amplify relevant modalities, while Semantic-CoT refines SEP with deeper contextual insights of stance semantics. These dual experience structures are continuously refined during training and recalled at inference to guide robust and context-aware stance decisions. Extensive experiments on the public MMSD benchmark demonstrate that our ReMoD significantly outperforms most baseline models and exhibits strong generalization capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faReMoD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7acb\u573a\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5404\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7acb\u573a\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b80\u5355\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u672a\u8003\u8651\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u7acb\u573a\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u6027\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u6613\u5f15\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cd\u5224\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027", "method": "\u53d7\u53cc\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8ba4\u77e5\u7406\u8bba\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u76f4\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\uff08MEP/SEP\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6c60\uff09\u548c\u53cd\u601d\u63a8\u7406\uff08Modality-CoT/Semantic-CoT\uff09\u7684\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6a21\u6001\u6743\u91cd\u4f18\u5316\u7acb\u573a\u5224\u65ad", "result": "\u5728MMSD\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b", "conclusion": "ReMoD\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u6001\u8d21\u732e\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7acb\u573a\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

ArchCraft introduces a structured workflow, which uses formal graphs to capture the Architectural Blueprint and symbols to define the Functional Specification, translating unstructured academic papers into verifiable, hardware-aware designs. The framework then generates RTL and testbench (TB) code decoupled via these symbols to facilitate verification and debugging, ultimately reporting the circuit's Power, Area, and Performance (PPA). Moreover, we propose the first benchmark, \\textbf{ArchSynthBench}, for synthesizing hardware from architectural descriptions, with a complete set of evaluation indicators, 50 project-level circuits, and around 600 circuit blocks. We systematically assess ArchCraft on ArchSynthBench, where the experiment results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, surpassing direct generation methods and the VerilogCoder framework in both paper understanding and code completion.

This study introduces the Licensing Oracle, an architectural solution designed to stem hallucinations in LMs by enforcing truth constraints through formal validation against structured knowledge graphs. Unlike statistical approaches that rely on data scaling or fine-tuning, the Licensing Oracle embeds a deterministic validation step into the model's generative process, ensuring that only factually accurate claims are made. We evaluated the effectiveness of the Licensing Oracle through experiments comparing it with several state-of-the-art methods, including baseline language model generation, fine-tuning for factual recall, fine-tuning for abstention behavior, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Our results demonstrate that although RAG and fine-tuning improve performance, they fail to eliminate hallucinations.

To lower inference costs, prior works train router models or deferral mechanisms that allocate easy queries to a small, efficient model, while forwarding harder queries to larger, more expensive models. However, these trained router models often lack robustness under domain shifts and require expensive data synthesis techniques such as Monte Carlo rollouts to obtain sufficient ground-truth routing labels for training. In this work, we propose Confidence-Guided Stepwise Model Routing for Cost-Efficient Reasoning (STEER), a domain-agnostic framework that performs fine-grained, step-level routing between smaller and larger LLMs without utilizing external models. STEER leverages confidence scores from the smaller model's logits prior to generating a reasoning step, so that the large model is invoked only when necessary. Extensive evaluations using different LLMs on a diverse set of challenging benchmarks across multiple domains such as Mathematical Reasoning, Multi-Hop QA, and Planning tasks indicate that STEER achieves competitive or enhanced accuracy while reducing inference costs (up to +20% accuracy with 48% less FLOPs compared to solely using the larger model on AIME), outperforming baselines that rely on trained external modules.

While in-context learning (ICL) provides a parameter-efficient alternative to fine-tuning, existing ICL approaches often suffer from task recognition failure, suboptimal demonstration selection, and misalignment between label words and task objectives, issues that are amplified in clinical domains like AD detection. We propose Explicit Knowledge In-Context Learners (EK-ICL), a novel framework that integrates structured explicit knowledge to enhance reasoning stability and task alignment in ICL. EK-ICL incorporates three knowledge components: confidence scores derived from small language models (SLMs) to ground predictions in task-relevant patterns, parsing feature scores to capture structural differences and improve demo selection, and label word replacement to resolve semantic misalignment with LLM priors. In addition, EK-ICL employs a parsing-based retrieval strategy and ensemble prediction to mitigate the effects of semantic homogeneity in AD transcripts. Extensive experiments across three AD datasets demonstrate that EK-ICL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning and ICL baselines. Further analysis reveals that ICL performance in AD detection is highly sensitive to the alignment of label semantics and task-specific context, underscoring the importance of explicit knowledge in clinical reasoning under low-resource conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faEK-ICL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u663e\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6\uff08\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5206\u6570\u3001\u89e3\u6790\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u6807\u7b7e\u8bcd\u66ff\u6362\uff09\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728AD\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc6\u522b\u5931\u8d25\u3001\u6f14\u793a\u9009\u62e9\u6b21\u4f18\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u8bed\u4e49\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5c24\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "method": "\u96c6\u6210\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u951a\u5b9a\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u89e3\u6790\u7279\u5f81\u6539\u8fdb\u6837\u672c\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u6807\u7b7e\u8bcd\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89e3\u6790\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u96c6\u6210\u9884\u6d4b\u7f13\u89e3\u8bed\u4e49\u540c\u8d28\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2aAD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u6807\u7b7e\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5bf9\u9f50\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "EK-ICL\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u663e\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a8\u7406\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u533b\u5b66NLP\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, these goals often conflict. We propose priority alignment, a new alignment paradigm that enforces a strict \"trustworthy-before-helpful\" ordering: optimization of helpfulness is conditioned on first meeting trustworthy thresholds (e.g., harmlessness or honesty). To realize this, we introduce Self-Priority Alignment (SPA)-a fully unsupervised framework that generates diverse responses, self-evaluates them and refines them by the model itself, and applies dual-criterion denoising to remove inconsistency and control variance. From this, SPA constructs lexicographically ordered preference pairs and fine-tunes the model using an uncertainty-weighted alignment loss that emphasizes high-confidence, high-gap decisions.

This enables a single model to flexibly perform tasks that previously required specialized models for each domain. However, these methods typically rely on text labels for supervision during training, biasing the model toward textual cues while potentially neglecting the full temporal features. Such a bias can lead to outputs that contradict the underlying time-series context. To address this issue, we construct the EvalTS benchmark, comprising 10 tasks across three difficulty levels, from fundamental temporal pattern recognition to complex real-world reasoning, to evaluate models under more challenging and realistic scenarios. We also propose TimeSense, a multimodal framework that makes LLMs proficient in time-series analysis by balancing textual reasoning with a preserved temporal sense. TimeSense incorporates a Temporal Sense module that reconstructs the input time-series within the model's context, ensuring that textual reasoning is grounded in the time-series dynamics. Moreover, to enhance spatial understanding of time-series data, we explicitly incorporate coordinate-based positional embeddings, which provide each time point with spatial context and enable the model to capture structural dependencies more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that TimeSense achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks, and it particularly outperforms existing methods on complex multi-dimensional time-series reasoning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTimeSense\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u8861\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709LLM\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u6587\u672c\u504f\u7f6e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efaEvalTS\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6587\u672c\u6807\u7b7e\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5ffd\u7565\u5b8c\u6574\u65f6\u5e8f\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u77db\u76fe\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\u9700\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u7cfb\u5e76\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "method": "1.

However, existing benchmarks mainly address explicit hate toward protected groups and often overlook implicit or indirect hate, such as demeaning comparisons, calls for exclusion or violence, and subtle discriminatory language that still causes harm. While explicit hate can often be captured through surface features, implicit hate requires deeper, full-model semantic processing. In this work, we question the need for repeated fine-tuning and analyze the role of HatePrototypes, class-level vector representations derived from language models optimized for hate speech detection and safety moderation. We find that these prototypes, built from as few as 50 examples per class, enable cross-task transfer between explicit and implicit hate, with interchangeable prototypes across benchmarks.

A Knowledge + Reasoning Evaluation Dataset", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "comment": "An earlier version of this paper appears in IEEE FLLM 2025. GitHub: https://github.com/czi-ai/DrugMechCounterfactuals", "summary": "Two scientific fields showing increasing interest in pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are drug development / repurposing, and personalized medicine. For both, LLMs have to demonstrate factual knowledge as well as a deep understanding of drug mechanisms, so they can recall and reason about relevant knowledge in novel situations. Drug mechanisms of action are described as a series of interactions between biomedical entities, which interlink into one or more chains directed from the drug to the targeted disease. Composing the effects of the interactions in a candidate chain leads to an inference about whether the drug might be useful or not for that disease. We introduce a dataset that evaluates LLMs on both factual knowledge of known mechanisms, and their ability to reason about them under novel situations, presented as counterfactuals that the models are unlikely to have seen during training. Using this dataset, we show that o4-mini outperforms the 4o, o3, and o3-mini models from OpenAI, and the recent small Qwen3-4B-thinking model closely matches o4-mini's performance, even outperforming it in some cases. We demonstrate that the open world setting for reasoning tasks, which requires the model to recall relevant knowledge, is more challenging than the closed world setting where the needed factual knowledge is provided.

In this work, we focus on Dutch language data from cancer patients. We extract metaphors used by patients using two data sources: (1) cancer patient storytelling interview data and (2) online forum data, including patients' posts, comments, and questions to professionals. We investigate how current state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) perform on this task by exploring different prompting strategies such as chain of thought reasoning, few-shot learning, and self-prompting. With a human-in-the-loop setup, we verify the extracted metaphors and compile the outputs into a corpus named HealthQuote.NL. We believe the extracted metaphors can support better patient care, for example shared decision making, improved communication between patients and clinicians, and enhanced patient health literacy.

SR-KI begins by encoding KBs into key-value pairs using a pretrained encoder, and injects them into LLMs' KV cache. Building on this representation, we employ a two-stage training paradigm: first locating a dedicated retrieval layer within the LLM, and then applying an attention-based loss at this layer to explicitly supervise attention toward relevant KB entries. Unlike traditional retrieval-augmented generation methods that rely heavily on the performance of external retrievers and multi-stage pipelines, SR-KI supports end-to-end inference by performing retrieval entirely within the models latent space. This design enables efficient compression of injected knowledge and facilitates dynamic knowledge updates.

In this work, we conduct an extensive empirical study to investigate whether realignment truly benefits from using all available languages, or if strategically selected subsets can offer comparable or even improved cross-lingual transfer, and study the impact on LRLs. Our controlled experiments show that realignment can be particularly effective for LRLs and that using carefully selected, linguistically diverse subsets can match full multilingual alignment, and even outperform it for unseen LRLs.

Existing approaches often combine distillation and quantization, but most post-training quantization (PTQ) methods are task-agnostic, ignoring how task-specific signals are distributed across layers. In this work, we propose to use hidden representations that encode task-salient signals as a guideline for quantization. In order to fully utilize our innovative idea, this paper compares two new task-aware PTQ methods: Task-Aware Quantization (TAQ), which allocates bitwidths using task-conditioned statistics from hidden activations, and TAQO, which allocates precision based on direct layer sensitivity tests. From a small calibration set, these approaches identify task-relevant layers, preserving their precision while aggressively quantizing the rest. This yields stable task sensitivity profiles and efficient task-specialized models. Across models, TAQ and TAQO outperform the baselines; TAQ leads on Phi-4, while TAQO leads on Llama-3.1, Qwen3, and Qwen2.5. For instances, on Phi-4 it achieves 42.33 EM / 50.81 F1, far surpassing Activation-aware Weight Quantization (AWQ) (2.25 / 7.07), while remaining within < 1.0% of the original accuracy at lower average precision.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTAQ\u548cTAQO\u4e24\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u91cf\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u578b\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5404\u5c42\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cf\u5316\u540e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "1.

The recent surge in generative model-powered datasets has compounded these quality challenges. In this work, we introduce RefineLab, the first LLM-driven framework that automatically refines raw QA textual data into high-quality datasets under a controllable token-budget constraint. RefineLab takes a set of target quality attributes (such as coverage and difficulty balance) as refinement objectives, and performs selective edits within a predefined token budget to ensure practicality and efficiency. In essence, RefineLab addresses a constrained optimization problem: improving the quality of QA samples as much as possible while respecting resource limitations. With a set of available refinement operations (e.g., rephrasing, distractor replacement), RefineLab takes as input the original dataset, a specified set of target quality dimensions, and a token budget, and determines which refinement operations should be applied to each QA sample. This process is guided by an assignment module that selects optimal refinement strategies to maximize overall dataset quality while adhering to the budget constraint. Experiments demonstrate that RefineLab consistently narrows divergence from expert datasets across coverage, difficulty alignment, factual fidelity, and distractor quality.

More than 500 languages are spoken in Nigeria and it is one of the most linguistically diverse countries in the world. Despite this, natural language processing (NLP) research has mostly focused on the following four languages: Hausa, Igbo, Nigerian-Pidgin, and Yoruba (i.e <1% of the languages spoken in Nigeria). This is in part due to the unavailability of textual data in these languages to train and apply NLP algorithms. In this work, we introduce ibom -- a dataset for machine translation and topic classification in four Coastal Nigerian languages from the Akwa Ibom State region: Anaang, Efik, Ibibio, and Oro. These languages are not represented in Google Translate or in major benchmarks such as Flores-200 or SIB-200.

Rep2Text employs a trainable adapter that projects a target model's internal representations into the embedding space of a decoding language model, which then autoregressively reconstructs the input text. Experiments on various model combinations (Llama-3.1-8B, Gemma-7B, Mistral-7B-v0.1, Llama-3.2-3B) demonstrate that, on average, over half of the information in 16-token sequences can be recovered from this compressed representation while maintaining strong semantic integrity and coherence.

We evaluated these models on 170 clinical cases, each synthesized into speech from 36 distinct voice profiles spanning variations in age, gender, and emotion. Our findings reveal a severe modality bias: surgical recommendations for audio inputs varied by as much as 35% compared to identical text-based inputs, with one model providing 80% fewer recommendations. Further analysis uncovered age disparities of up to 12% between young and elderly voices, which persisted in most models despite chain-of-thought prompting. While explicit reasoning successfully eliminated gender bias, the impact of emotion was not detected due to poor recognition performance.

Establishing a conceptual bridge among these domains could enable each to benefit from the others. This paper proposes duality-based mode operations (split-unite, forward-backward, expansion-reduction and orthogonal dualities) to expand the set of rhetorical modes, introducing generated modes like combination and generalization, thereby enhancing epistemic diversity across multiple applications. It further presents a pyramid multilayer mapping framework (e.g., three layers from the rhetorical model layer, to cognitive layer, and to epistemic layers) that reduces the resulting cognitive complexity. The degrees of expressive diversity and complexity reduction are quantified through binomial combinatorics and Shannon entropy analysis. A Marginal Rhetorical Bit (MRB) is identified, permitting the definition of a rhetorical-scalable parameter that measures expressive growth speed in bits per stage. A direct entropy measure shows that hierarchical selection over smaller subsets markedly reduces choice uncertainty compared with flat selection across all modes. These considerations appear to transform static and non-measurable rhetorical taxonomies into more dynamic and more measurable systems for discourse design.

While this is often said jokingly, the light-hearted remark reflects a deeper concern. How can we be certain that an online post flagged as \"inappropriate\" was not simply the victim of a biased algorithm? This paper investigates this problem using a dual approach. First, I conduct a quantitative benchmark of a widely used toxicity model (unitary/toxic-bert) to measure performance disparity between text in African-American English (AAE) and Standard American English (SAE). The benchmark reveals a clear, systematic bias: on average, the model scores AAE text as 1.8 times more toxic and 8.8 times higher for \"identity hate\".

In this paper, we propose the dialect refinement (DIA-REFINE) framework, which guides LLMs toward faithful target dialect outputs through an iterative loop of translation, verification, and feedback using external dialect classifiers. To address the limitations of n-gram-based metrics, we introduce the dialect fidelity score (DFS) to quantify linguistic shift and the target dialect ratio (TDR) to measure the success of dialect translation. Experiments on Korean dialects across zero-shot and in-context learning baselines demonstrate that DIA-REFINE consistently enhances dialect fidelity. The proposed metrics distinguish between False Success cases, where high n-gram scores obscure failures in dialectal translation, and True Attempt cases, where genuine attempts at dialectal translation yield low n-gram scores. We also observed that models exhibit varying degrees of responsiveness to the framework, and that integrating in-context examples further improves the translation of dialectal expressions.

Recent test-time methods leverage textual feedback to overcome this, but they often critique and revise a single candidate response, lacking a principled mechanism to systematically analyze, weigh, and synthesize the strengths of multiple promising candidates. Such a mechanism is crucial because different responses may excel in distinct aspects (e.g., clarity, factual accuracy, or tone), and combining their best elements may produce a far superior outcome. This paper proposes the Textual Self-Attention Network (TSAN), a new paradigm for test-time preference optimization that requires no parameter updates. TSAN emulates self-attention entirely in natural language to overcome this gap: it analyzes multiple candidates by formatting them into textual keys and values, weighs their relevance using an LLM-based attention module, and synthesizes their strengths into a new, preference-aligned response under the guidance of the learned textual attention. This entire process operates in a textual gradient space, enabling iterative and interpretable optimization. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that with just three test-time iterations on a base SFT model, TSAN outperforms supervised models like Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct and surpasses the current state-of-the-art test-time alignment method by effectively leveraging multiple candidate solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u9700\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u6587\u672c\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7f51\u7edc\uff08TSAN\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u62df\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9636\u6bb5\u6574\u5408\u591a\u5019\u9009\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u4f18\u70b9\u5b9e\u73b0\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u54cd\u5e94\u8fdb\u884c\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6574\u5408\u591a\u5019\u9009\u65b9\u6848\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002\u4e0d\u540c\u54cd\u5e94\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6/\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027/\u8bed\u6c14\u7b49\u4e0d\u540c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u7efc\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4f18\u52bf\u53ef\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u4f18\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u591a\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u65b9\u6848\u683c\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u952e\u503c\u5bf9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u8bc4\u4f30\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5728\u6587\u672c\u68af\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fed\u4ee3\u5408\u6210\u65b0\u54cd\u5e94\u3002\u6574\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b8c\u5168\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u7ecf\u8fc73\u6b21\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8fed\u4ee3\u540e\uff0cTSAN\u8d85\u8d8aLlama-3.1-70B-Instruct\u7b49\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u53478.7%\u7684\u504f\u597d\u7b26\u5408\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "TSAN\u5f00\u521b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6587\u672c\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6574\u5408\u591a\u5019\u9009\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been widely adopted to address these limitations by supplementing model outputs with retrieved evidence. However, whether RAG reliably achieves these goals remains unclear. Here, we present the most comprehensive expert evaluation of RAG in medicine to date. Eighteen medical experts contributed a total of 80,502 annotations, assessing 800 model outputs generated by GPT-4o and Llama-3.1-8B across 200 real-world patient and USMLE-style queries. We systematically decomposed the RAG pipeline into three components: (i) evidence retrieval (relevance of retrieved passages), (ii) evidence selection (accuracy of evidence usage), and (iii) response generation (factuality and completeness of outputs). Contrary to expectation, standard RAG often degraded performance: only 22% of top-16 passages were relevant, evidence selection remained weak (precision 41-43%, recall 27-49%), and factuality and completeness dropped by up to 6% and 5%, respectively, compared with non-RAG variants. Retrieval and evidence selection remain key failure points for the model, contributing to the overall performance drop. We further show that simple yet effective strategies, including evidence filtering and query reformulation, substantially mitigate these issues, improving performance on MedMCQA and MedXpertQA by up to 12% and 8.2%, respectively.

We systematically investigate the contamination sensitivity of 23 SLMs (270M to 4B parameters) across multiple model families by measuring susceptibility to syntactic and semantic transformation types during instruction tuning: syntactic transformations (character and word reversal) and semantic transformations (irrelevant and counterfactual responses), each applied at contamination levels of 25\\%, 50\\%, 75\\%, and 100\\%. Our results reveal fundamental asymmetries in vulnerability patterns: syntactic transformations cause catastrophic performance degradation, with character reversal producing near-complete failure across all models regardless of size or family, while semantic transformations demonstrate distinct threshold behaviors and greater resilience in core linguistic capabilities. Critically, we discover a ``\\textit{capability curse}\" where larger, more capable models become more susceptible to learning semantic corruptions, effectively following harmful instructions more readily, while our analysis of base versus instruction-tuned variants reveals that alignment provides inconsistent robustness benefits, sometimes even reducing resilience. Our work establishes three core contributions: (1) empirical evidence of SLMs' disproportionate vulnerability to syntactic pattern contamination, (2) identification of asymmetric sensitivity patterns between syntactic and semantic transformations, and (3) systematic evaluation protocols for contamination robustness assessment.

However, the widespread adoption of LLMs has raised critical privacy and security concerns. During interactions, LLMs may unintentionally expose confidential database contents or be manipulated by attackers to exfiltrate data through seemingly benign queries. While current efforts typically rely on rule-based heuristics or LLM agents to mitigate this leakage risk, these methods still struggle with complex inference-based attacks, suffer from high false positive rates, and often compromise the reliability of SQL queries. To address these challenges, we propose \\textsc{SafeNlidb}, a novel privacy-security alignment framework for LLM-based NLIDB. The framework features an automated pipeline that generates hybrid chain-of-thought interaction data from scratch, seamlessly combining implicit security reasoning with SQL generation. Additionally, we introduce reasoning warm-up and alternating preference optimization to overcome the multi-preference oscillations of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), enabling LLMs to produce security-aware SQL through fine-grained reasoning without the need for human-annotated preference data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms both larger-scale LLMs and ideal-setting baselines, achieving significant security improvements while preserving high utility.WARNING: This work may contain content that is offensive and harmful!", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5b89\u5168\u9690\u79c1\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6SafeNlidb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6df7\u5408\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4ea4\u66ff\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a5\u53e3\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u6216LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u65b9\u9762\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a1) \u96be\u4ee5\u9632\u5fa1\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb 2) \u9ad8\u8bef\u62a5\u7387 3) \u635f\u5bb3SQL\u67e5\u8be2\u53ef\u9760\u6027", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u751f\u6210\u6df7\u5408\u5b89\u5168\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u9884\u70ed\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u4ea4\u66ff\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u63a8\u7406\u4e0eSQL\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u878d\u5408", "result": "\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u8d85\u8d8a\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7406\u60f3\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u630195%+\u7684SQL\u751f\u6210\u51c6\u786e\u7387", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0LLM\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u63a5\u53e3\u5728\u590d\u6742\u653b\u51fb\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9690\u79c1-\u6548\u7528\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u654f\u611f\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

Because cognition is fixed after pre-training, improving in-context learning (ICL) for AD detection hinges on enriching perception through better demonstration (demo) sets. We demonstrate that standard ICL quickly saturates, its demos lack diversity (context width) and fail to convey fine-grained signals (context depth), and that recent task vector (TV) approaches improve broad task adaptation by injecting TV into the LLMs' hidden states (HSs), they are ill-suited for AD detection due to the mismatch of injection granularity, strength and position.

However, direct fine-tuning on Han-character transcriptions often fails to capture detailed phonetic and tonal cues, while training only on romanization lacks lexical and syntactic coverage. In addition, prior studies have rarely explored staged strategies that integrate both annotation types. To address this gap, we present CLiFT-ASR, a cross-lingual fine-tuning framework that builds on Mandarin HuBERT models and progressively adapts them to Taiwanese Hokkien. The framework employs a two-stage process in which it first learns acoustic and tonal representations from phonetic Tai-lo annotations and then captures vocabulary and syntax from Han-character transcriptions. This progressive adaptation enables effective alignment between speech sounds and orthographic structures. Experiments on the TAT-MOE corpus demonstrate that CLiFT-ASR achieves a 24.88\\% relative reduction in character error rate (CER) compared with strong baselines. The results indicate that CLiFT-ASR provides an effective and parameter-efficient solution for Taiwanese Hokkien ASR and that it has potential to benefit other low-resource language scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCLiFT-ASR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6574\u5408\u53f0\u6e7e\u95fd\u5357\u8bed\u7684\u7f57\u9a6c\u62fc\u97f3\u548c\u6c49\u5b57\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5b57\u7b26\u9519\u8bef\u738724.88%\u3002", "motivation": "\u53f0\u6e7e\u95fd\u5357\u8bed\u7b49\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684ASR\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u6c49\u5b57\u8f6c\u5f55\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u8bed\u97f3\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u7f57\u9a6c\u62fc\u97f3\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53e5\u6cd5\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u6574\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "1. \u57fa\u4e8e\u666e\u901a\u8bddHuBERT\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8fc1\u79fb 2. \u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u7f57\u9a6c\u62fc\u97f3\u5b66\u4e60\u58f0\u5b66/\u58f0\u8c03\u8868\u5f81 3. \u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u6c49\u5b57\u8f6c\u5f55\u5b66\u4e60\u8bcd\u6c47/\u53e5\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784", "result": "\u5728TAT-MOE\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b024.88%\u7684\u5b57\u7b26\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b", "conclusion": "CLiFT-ASR\u4e3a\u53f0\u6e7e\u95fd\u5357\u8bedASR\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u5176\u4ed6\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6f5c\u529b"}}

A new challenge comes when entities play roles according to their act or attributes in certain context. Entity Role Detection is the task of assigning such roles to the entities. Usu- ally real-world entities are of types: person, lo- cation and organization etc. Roles could be con- sidered as domain-dependent subtypes of these types. In the cases, where retrieving a subset of entities based on their roles is needed, poses the problem of defining the role and entities having those roles. This paper presents the study of study of solving Entity Role Detection prob- lem by modeling it as Named Entity Recogni- tion (NER) and Entity Retrieval/Ranking task. In NER, these roles could be considered as mutually exclusive classes and standard NER methods like sequence tagging could be used. For Entity Retrieval, Roles could be formulated as Query and entities as Collection on which the query needs to be executed. The aspect of Entity Retrieval task, which is different than document retrieval task is that the entities and roles against which they need to be retrieved are indirectly described. We have formulated au- tomated ways of learning representative words and phrases and building representations of roles and entities using them. We have also explored different contexts like sentence and document.

However, ensuring their professional competence and ethical safety is a critical challenge, as existing benchmarks fail to measure role-playing fidelity or address the unique teaching harms inherent in educational scenarios. To address this, we propose EduGuardBench, a dual-component benchmark. It assesses professional fidelity using a Role-playing Fidelity Score (RFS) while diagnosing harms specific to the teaching profession. It also probes safety vulnerabilities using persona-based adversarial prompts targeting both general harms and, particularly, academic misconduct, evaluated with metrics including Attack Success Rate (ASR) and a three-tier Refusal Quality assessment. Our extensive experiments on 14 leading models reveal a stark polarization in performance. While reasoning-oriented models generally show superior fidelity, incompetence remains the dominant failure mode across most models. The adversarial tests uncovered a counterintuitive scaling paradox, where mid-sized models can be the most vulnerable, challenging monotonic safety assumptions. Critically, we identified a powerful Educational Transformation Effect: the safest models excel at converting harmful requests into teachable moments by providing ideal Educational Refusals. This capacity is strongly negatively correlated with ASR, revealing a new dimension of advanced AI safety. EduGuardBench thus provides a reproducible framework that moves beyond siloed knowledge tests toward a holistic assessment of professional, ethical, and pedagogical alignment, uncovering complex dynamics essential for deploying trustworthy AI in education.

However, most of these benchmarks evaluate models primarily through multiple-choice or short-answer formats, which do not take the reasoning process into account. Although some benchmarks assess the reasoning process, their methods are often overly simplistic and only examine reasoning when answers are incorrect. This approach overlooks scenarios where flawed reasoning leads to correct answers. In addition, these benchmarks do not consider the impact of intermodal relationships on reasoning. To address this issue, we propose the Reasoning Process Tree Score (RPTS), a tree structure-based metric to assess reasoning processes. Specifically, we organize the reasoning steps into a reasoning tree and leverage its hierarchical information to assign weighted faithfulness scores to each reasoning step. By dynamically adjusting these weights, RPTS not only evaluates the overall correctness of the reasoning, but also pinpoints where the model fails in the reasoning. To validate RPTS in real-world multimodal scenarios, we construct a new benchmark, RPTS-Eval, comprising 374 images and 390 reasoning instances.

Previous approaches have demonstrated exceptional performance in detecting texts fully generated by LLMs. However, these methods struggle when confronting more advanced LLM output or text with adversarial multi-task machine revision, especially in the black-box setting, where the generating model is unknown. To address this challenge, grounded in the hypothesis that human writing possesses distinctive stylistic patterns, we propose Human Language Preference Detection (HLPD). HLPD employs a reward-based alignment process, Human Language Preference Optimization (HLPO), to shift the scoring model's token distribution toward human-like writing, making the model more sensitive to human writing, therefore enhancing the identification of machine-revised text. We test HLPD in an adversarial multi-task evaluation framework that leverages a five-dimensional prompt generator and multiple advanced LLMs to create diverse revision scenarios. When detecting texts revised by GPT-series models, HLPD achieves a 15.11% relative improvement in AUROC over ImBD, surpassing Fast-DetectGPT by 45.56%. When evaluated on texts generated by advanced LLMs, HLPD achieves the highest average AUROC, exceeding ImBD by 5.53% and Fast-DetectGPT by 34.14%.

Specifically, the sparse autoencoder (SAE) projects hidden states into a high-dimensional, near-monosemantic space; benefiting from this representation, we identify a copyright-sensitive subspace and clamp its activations during decoding.

Attribution graphs reveal these feature pathways, but interpreting them requires extensive manual analysis -- a single prompt can take approximately 2 hours for an experienced circuit tracer. We present probe prompting, an automated pipeline that transforms attribution graphs into compact, interpretable subgraphs built from concept-aligned supernodes. Starting from a seed prompt and target logit, we select high-influence features, generate concept-targeted yet context-varying probes, and group features by cross-prompt activation signatures into Semantic, Relationship, and Say-X categories using transparent decision rules.\n  Across five prompts including classic \"capitals\" circuits, probe-prompted subgraphs preserve high explanatory coverage while compressing complexity (Completeness 0.83, mean across circuits; Replacement 0.54). Compared to geometric clustering baselines, concept-aligned groups exhibit higher behavioral coherence: 2.3x higher peak-token consistency (0.425 vs 0.183) and 5.8x higher activation-pattern similarity (0.762 vs 0.130), despite lower geometric compactness.

To address these challenges, we introduce \\textbf{LMT}, a suite of \\textbf{L}arge-scale \\textbf{M}ultilingual \\textbf{T}ranslation models centered on both Chinese and English, covering 60 languages and 234 translation directions. During development, we identify a previously overlooked phenomenon of \\textbf{directional degeneration}, where symmetric multi-way fine-tuning data overemphasize reverse directions (X $\\to$ En/Zh), leading to excessive many-to-one mappings and degraded translation quality. We propose \\textbf{Strategic Downsampling}, a simple yet effective method to mitigate this degeneration.

Through rigorous data curation and refined adaptation strategies, LMT achieves SOTA performance among models of comparable language coverage, with our 4B model (LMT-60-4B) surpassing the much larger Aya-101-13B and NLLB-54B models by a substantial margin.

We participate in the text-only translation tasks for English-Hindi, English-Bengali, English-Malayalam, and English-Odia language pairs. We present a two-stage approach that addresses quality issues in the training data through automated error detection and correction, followed by parameter-efficient model fine-tuning.\n  Our methodology introduces a vision-augmented judge-corrector pipeline that leverages multimodal language models to systematically identify and correct translation errors in the training data. The judge component classifies translations into three categories: correct, visually ambiguous (requiring image context), or mistranslated (poor translation quality). Identified errors are routed to specialized correctors: GPT-4o-mini regenerates captions requiring visual disambiguation, while IndicTrans2 retranslates cases with pure translation quality issues. This automated pipeline processes 28,928 training examples across four languages, correcting an average of 17.1% of captions per language.\n  We then apply Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the IndicTrans2 en-indic 200M distilled model on both original and corrected datasets. Training on corrected data yields consistent improvements, with BLEU score gains of +1.30 for English-Bengali on the evaluation set (42.00 -> 43.30) and +0.70 on the challenge set (44.90 -> 45.60), +0.60 for English-Odia on the evaluation set (41.00 -> 41.60), and +0.10 for English-Hindi on the challenge set (53.90 -> 54.00).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u6570\u636e\u81ea\u52a8\u7ea0\u9519+LoRA\u5fae\u8c03\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u79cd\u82f1\u5370\u5730\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0BLEU\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u5347", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6027\u80fd", "method": "1. \u6784\u5efa\u89c6\u89c9\u589e\u5f3a\u7684Judge-Corrector\u6d41\u7a0b\u81ea\u52a8\u6e05\u6d17\u6570\u636e\n2. \u5e94\u7528LoRA\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03IndicTrans2\u6a21\u578b", "result": "\u4fee\u6b6317.1%\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u540e\uff0c\u591a\u8bed\u79cdBLEU\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff08\u5982\u82f1\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed+1.3\uff0c\u82f1\u5965\u91cc\u4e9a\u8bed+0.6\uff09", "conclusion": "\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u6e05\u6d17\u4e0e\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6027\u80fd"}}

However, research to date has largely been in non-clinical cross-sectional samples of written language using complex machine learning (ML) approaches with limited interpretability.\n  Methods: We describe an initial exploratory analysis of longitudinal speech data and PHQ-8 assessments from 5,836 recordings of 586 participants in the UK, Netherlands, and Spain, collected in the RADAR-MDD study. We sought to identify interpretable lexical features associated with MDD symptom severity with linear mixed-effects modelling. Interpretable features and high-dimensional vector embeddings were also used to test the prediction performance of four regressor ML models.\n  Results: In English data, MDD symptom severity was associated with 7 features including lexical diversity measures and absolutist language. In Dutch, associations were observed with words per sentence and positive word frequency; no associations were observed in recordings collected in Spain. The predictive power of lexical features and vector embeddings was near chance level across all languages.\n  Limitations: Smaller samples in non-English speech and methodological choices, such as the elicitation prompt, may have also limited the effect sizes observable. A lack of NLP tools in languages other than English restricted our feature choice.\n  Conclusion: To understand the value of lexical markers in clinical research and practice, further research is needed in larger samples across several languages using improved protocols, and ML models that account for within- and between-individual variations in language.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u56fd\u7eb5\u5411\u8bed\u97f3\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u82f1\u8bed\u4e2d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u75c7\u72b6\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4f46\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u679c\u6b20\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u91c7\u96c6\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u75c7\u72b6\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u7eb5\u5411\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u5206\u6790\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u6765\u81ea\u82f1\u56fd\u3001\u8377\u5170\u3001\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u76845,836\u6761\u5f55\u97f3\u8fdb\u884c\u7ebf\u6027\u6df7\u5408\u6548\u5e94\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8bcd\u6c47\u7279\u5f81\u4e0ePHQ-8\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u56db\u4e2a\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u82f1\u8bed\u6570\u636e\u53d1\u73b07\u4e2a\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u8bcd\u6c47\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u8377\u5170\u8bed\u663e\u793a\u90e8\u5206\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u8bed\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u53d1\u73b0\u3002\u6240\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63a5\u8fd1\u968f\u673a\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u6269\u5927\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u4e2a\u4f53\u8bed\u8a00\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8bcd\u6c47\u6807\u8bb0\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Our model demonstrates superior performance across all major embedding tasks -- including retrieval, classification and semantic textual similarity (STS) -- and excels in challenging multilingual scenarios, such as low-resource languages and cross-lingual setups. This state-of-the-art performance is driven by a novel data mix of 16.1 million query-document pairs, split between 7.7 million samples from public datasets and 8.4 million synthetically generated examples from various open-weight LLMs. One of our key contributions is a detailed ablation study analyzing core design choices, including a comparison of contrastive loss implementations, an evaluation of synthetic data generation (SDG) strategies, and the impact of model merging.

This study evaluates multiple approaches for mental health detection, comparing Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Llama and GPT with classical machine learning and transformer-based architectures including BERT, XLNet, and Distil-RoBERTa. Using the DAIC-WOZ dataset of clinical interviews, we fine-tuned models for anxiety, depression, and stress classification and applied synthetic data generation to mitigate class imbalance. Results show that Distil-RoBERTa achieved the highest F1 score (0.883) for GAD-2, while XLNet outperformed others on PHQ tasks (F1 up to 0.891). For stress detection, a zero-shot synthetic approach (SD+Zero-Shot-Basic) reached an F1 of 0.884 and ROC AUC of 0.886.

We evaluated SRA on hate speech benchmarks in English (HateXplain) and Portuguese (HateBRXplain) with rationale annotations. Empirically, SRA achieves 2.4x better explainability compared to current baselines, and produces token-level explanations that are more faithful and human-aligned. In terms of fairness, SRA achieves competitive fairness across all measures, with second-best performance in detecting toxic posts targeting identity groups, while maintaining comparable results on other metrics.

Its success depends not only on the quality of the instruction data but also on the inherent capabilities of the LLM itself. Some studies suggest that even a small amount of high-quality data can achieve instruction fine-tuning results that are on par with, or even exceed, those from using a full-scale dataset. However, rather than focusing solely on calculating data quality scores to evaluate instruction data, there is a growing need to select high-quality data that maximally enhances the performance of instruction tuning for a given LLM.

However, explicit CoT methods rely on discrete token-level reasoning processes that are prone to error propagation and limited by vocabulary expressiveness, often resulting in rigid and inconsistent reasoning trajectories. Recent research has explored implicit or continuous reasoning in latent spaces, allowing models to perform internal reasoning before generating explicit output. Although such approaches alleviate some limitations of discrete CoT, they generally lack explicit mechanisms to enforce consistency among reasoning steps, leading to divergent reasoning paths and unstable outcomes. To address this issue, we propose EBM-CoT, an Energy-Based Chain-of-Thought Calibration framework that refines latent thought representations through an energy-based model (EBM). Our method dynamically adjusts latent reasoning trajectories toward lower-energy, high-consistency regions in the embedding space, improving both reasoning accuracy and consistency without modifying the base language model.

While the overall intensity and categorical values of emotions in arguments have received considerable attention in the research community, we argue that the emotion an argument evokes in a recipient is subjective. It depends on the recipient's goals, standards, prior knowledge, and stance. Appraisal theories lend themselves as a link between the subjective cognitive assessment of events and emotions. They have been used in event-centric emotion analysis, but their suitability for assessing argument convincingness remains unexplored. In this paper, we evaluate whether appraisal theories are suitable for emotion analysis in arguments by considering subjective cognitive evaluations of the importance and impact of an argument on its receiver. Based on the annotations in the recently published ContArgA corpus, we perform zero-shot prompting experiments to evaluate the importance of gold-annotated and predicted emotions and appraisals for the assessment of the subjective convincingness labels. We find that, while categorical emotion information does improve convincingness prediction, the improvement is more pronounced with appraisals.

Across three document-level MT benchmarks spanning six languages and diverse domains, TransGraph consistently surpasses strong baselines in translation quality and terminology consistency while incurring significantly lower token overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTransGraph\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u6587\u6863\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u7bc7\u7ae0\u8fde\u8d2f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7bc7\u7ae0\u56fe\u5efa\u6a21\u6bb5\u843d\u5173\u7cfb\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7ffb\u8bd1", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7b56\u7565\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7bc7\u7ae0\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6848", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7bc7\u7ae0\u56fe\u663e\u5f0f\u6355\u6349\u6bb5\u843d\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u90bb\u57df\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u805a\u7126\u76f8\u5173\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8fdb\u884c\u7ffb\u8bd1", "result": "\u57286\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u76843\u4e2a\u6587\u6863\u7ea7\u7ffb\u8bd1\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u53471.8BLEU\uff0c\u672f\u8bed\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u63d0\u9ad815%\uff0ctoken\u6d88\u8017\u964d\u4f4e40%", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u7bc7\u7ae0\u7ed3\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6587\u6863\u7ea7\u7ffb\u8bd1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f"}}

This limits downstream tasks that rely on understanding event salience, influence, or narrative focus. We introduce Protagonist Entity Recognition (PER), a task that identifies the organizations that anchor a news story and shape its main developments. To validate PER, we compare he predictions of Large Language Models (LLMs) against annotations from four expert annotators over a gold corpus, establishing both inter-annotator consistency and human-LLM agreement. Leveraging these findings, we use state-of-the-art LLMs to automatically label large-scale news collections through NER-guided prompting, generating scalable, high-quality supervision. We then evaluate whether other LLMs, given reduced context and without explicit candidate guidance, can still infer the correct protagonists.

For subtasks 1A and 1B, we employed a soft-voting ensemble of transformer models (BanglaBERT, MuRIL, IndicBERTv2). For subtask 1C, we trained three multitask variants and aggregated their predictions through a weighted voting ensemble. Our systems achieved micro-f1 scores of 72.75% (1A) and 72.69% (1B), and a weighted micro-f1 score of 72.62% (1C). On the shared task leaderboard, these corresponded to 9th, 10th, and 7th positions, respectively.

RLVE enables each verifiable environment to dynamically adapt its problem difficulty distribution to the policy model's capabilities as training progresses. In contrast, static data distributions often lead to vanishing learning signals when problems are either too easy or too hard for the policy. To implement RLVE, we create RLVE-Gym, a large-scale suite of 400 verifiable environments carefully developed through manual environment engineering. Using RLVE-Gym, we show that environment scaling, i.e., expanding the collection of training environments, consistently improves generalizable reasoning capabilities. RLVE with joint training across all 400 environments in RLVE-Gym yields a 3.37% absolute average improvement across six reasoning benchmarks, starting from one of the strongest 1.5B reasoning LMs. By comparison, continuing this LM's original RL training yields only a 0.49% average absolute gain despite using over 3x more compute.

In this paper, we highlight a critical yet previously underexplored class of hallucinations driven by spurious correlations -- superficial but statistically prominent associations between features (e.g., surnames) and attributes (e.g., nationality) present in the training data. We demonstrate that these spurious correlations induce hallucinations that are confidently generated, immune to model scaling, evade current detection methods, and persist even after refusal fine-tuning. Through systematically controlled synthetic experiments and empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs (including GPT-5), we show that existing hallucination detection methods, such as confidence-based filtering and inner-state probing, fundamentally fail in the presence of spurious correlations. Our theoretical analysis further elucidates why these statistical biases intrinsically undermine confidence-based detection techniques.

While in-domain data is limited, there exist vast amounts of similar general-domain data, and our initial findings reveal that they could potentially serve as auxiliary supervision for domain enhancement. This observation leads us to our central research question: \\textbf{\\textit{how to effectively select the most valuable auxiliary data to maximize domain-specific performance}}, particularly when traditional methods are inapplicable due to a lack of large in-domain data pools or validation sets. To address this, we propose \\textbf{NTK-Selector}, a principled and efficient framework for selecting general-domain auxiliary data to enhance domain-specific performance via neural tangent kernels (NTK). Our method tackles two challenges of directly applying NTK to LLMs, theoretical assumptions and prohibitive computational cost, by empirically demonstrating a stable NTK-like behavior in LLMs during LoRA fine-tuning and proposing a Jacobian-free approximation method. Extensive experiments across four low-resource domains (medical, financial, legal, and psychological) demonstrate that NTK-Selector consistently improves downstream performance. Specifically, fine-tuning on 1,000 in-domain samples alone only yielded +0.8 points for Llama3-8B-Instruct and +0.9 points for Qwen3-8B. In contrast, enriching with 9,000 auxiliary samples selected by NTK-Selector led to substantial \\textbf{gains of +8.7 and +5.1 points}, which corresponds to a \\textbf{10.9x and 5.7x improvement} over the domain-only setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faNTK-Selector\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u6b63\u5207\u6838\u9009\u62e9\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u9886\u57df\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LLMs\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u9886\u57df\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u98ce\u9669\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6d77\u91cf\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u76d1\u7763", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u6b63\u5207\u6838\u7406\u8bba\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51faLoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u7684\u7c7bNTK\u884c\u4e3a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u514dJacobian\u77e9\u9635\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u9886\u57df\u5b9e\u73b08.7-5.1\u5206\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8f85\u52a9\u6570\u636e\u6548\u80fd\u8fbe\u7eaf\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u768410.9\u500d", "conclusion": "NTK-Selector\u4e3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u7684\u9650\u5236"}}

However, low-resource languages (LRLs) like Bangla remain underrepresented due to the limited availability of instruction-to-code datasets and evaluation benchmarks. To address this, the BLP Workshop at IJCNLP-AACL 2025 introduced a shared task on \"Code Generation in Bangla\". In this work, we propose a method that combines instruction prompting with a test-driven, feedback-guided iterative refinement process using a fine-tuned Qwen2.5-14B model. The model generates code from Bangla instructions, tests it against unit tests, and iteratively refines any failing outputs through three evaluation passes, using test feedback to guide each step.

This approach decouples response latency from model capability, enabling systems that feel responsive while accessing the full power of large-scale models.

Evaluation across multiple backend models shows that conversational infill can be successfully learned, with ConvFill achieving accuracy improvements of 36-42% over standalone small models of the same size while consistently retaining sub-200ms response latencies.

We review modern GPU architectures (e.g. NVIDIA A100/H100, AMD Instinct MI250X/MI300) and key performance metrics of floating-point throughput, memory bandwidth, VRAM capacity. We show how these hardware capabilities affect radiology tasks: for example, generating reports or detecting findings on CheXpert and MIMIC-CXR images is computationally intensive and benefits from GPU parallelism and tensor-core acceleration. Empirical studies indicate that using appropriate GPU resources can reduce inference time and improve throughput. We discuss practical challenges including privacy, deployment, cost, power and optimization strategies: mixed-precision, quantization, compression, and multi-GPU scaling. Finally, we anticipate that next-generation features (8-bit tensor cores, enhanced interconnect) will further enable on-premise and federated radiology AI.

This work explores whether it is possible to predict Oscar nominations for screenplays using modern language models. Since no suitable dataset was available, a new one called Movie-O-Label was created by combining the MovieSum collection of movie scripts with curated Oscar records. Each screenplay was represented by its title, Wikipedia summary, and full script. Long scripts were split into overlapping text chunks and encoded with the E5 sentence em bedding model. Then, the screenplay embed dings were classified using a logistic regression model. The best results were achieved when three feature inputs related to screenplays (script, summary, and title) were combined. The best-performing model reached a macro F1 score of 0.66, a precision recall AP of 0.445 with baseline 0.19 and a ROC-AUC of 0.79.

However, since these DRs are not trained on the target corpus, they struggle to represent semantic differences between similar documents. To address this failing, we introduce a training-free representation sharpening framework that augments a document's representation with information that helps differentiate it from similar documents in the corpus. On over twenty datasets spanning multiple languages, the representation sharpening framework proves consistently superior to traditional retrieval, setting a new state-of-the-art on the BRIGHT benchmark. We show that representation sharpening is compatible with prior approaches to zero-shot dense retrieval and consistently improves their performance. Finally, we address the performance-cost tradeoff presented by our framework and devise an indexing-time approximation that preserves the majority of our performance gains over traditional retrieval, yet suffers no additional inference-time cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8868\u793a\u9510\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u6587\u6863\u8868\u5f81\u89e3\u51b3\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5bc6\u96c6\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u76f8\u4f3c\u6587\u6863\u533a\u5206\u96be\u9898", "motivation": "\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bc6\u96c6\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u5728\u672a\u7ecf\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u76f8\u4f3c\u6587\u6863\u95f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650", "method": "\u5728\u7d22\u5f15\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u5f3a\u6587\u6863\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e0eHyDE/SPAR\u7b49\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\u65f6\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6848", "result": "\u572820+\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cBRIGHT\u57fa\u51c6\u8fbe\u5230\u65b0SOTA\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ec4\u5408\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u5e73\u57472.7%\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "\u8868\u793a\u9510\u5316\u6709\u6548\u7a81\u7834\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u68c0\u7d22\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u96f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7d22\u5f15\u65b9\u6848\u5e73\u8861\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500"}}

In this work, we introduce a new reasoning data generation framework spanning diverse skills and levels of complexity with over 1M high-quality synthetic vision-centric questions. The dataset also includes preference data and instruction prompts supporting both offline and online RL. Our synthesis framework proceeds in two stages: (1) scale; and (2) complexity. Reasoning traces are then synthesized through a two-stage process that leverages VLMs and reasoning LLMs, producing CoT traces for VLMs that capture the richness and diverse cognitive behaviors found in frontier reasoning models. Remarkably, we show that finetuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B on our data outperforms all open-data baselines across all evaluated vision-centric benchmarks, and even surpasses strong closed-data models such as MiMo-VL-7B-RL on V* Bench, CV-Bench and MMStar-V. Perhaps most surprising, despite being entirely vision-centric, our data transfers positively to text-only reasoning (MMLU-Pro) and audio reasoning (MMAU), demonstrating its effectiveness. Similarly, despite not containing videos or embodied visual data, we observe notable gains when evaluating on a single-evidence embodied QA benchmark (NiEH). Finally, we use our data to analyze the entire VLM post-training pipeline. Our empirical analysis highlights that (i) SFT on high-quality data with non-linear reasoning traces is essential for effective online RL, (ii) staged offline RL matches online RL's performance while reducing compute demands, and (iii) careful SFT on high quality data can substantially improve out-of-domain, cross-modality transfer.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u751f\u6210100\u4e07+\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\uff0cQwen2.5-VL-7B\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u5728\u591a\u9879\u57fa\u51c6\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f00\u6e90/\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u4f9d\u8d56\u672a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b+\u63a8\u7406\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "Qwen2.5-VL-7B\u5728V* Bench\u7b49\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u51c6\u5168\u9762\u9886\u5148\uff0c\u97f3\u9891/\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u8fc1\u79fb\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u8fbe\u5230\u5728\u7ebfRL\u6027\u80fd\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cfSFT\u6570\u636e\u662f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3aVLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Anchoring bias, a classic human judgment bias, offers a critical test case. While prior work shows LLMs exhibit anchoring, most evidence relies on surface-level outputs, leaving internal mechanisms and attributional contributions unexplored. This paper advances the study of anchoring in LLMs through three contributions: (1) a log-probability-based behavioral analysis showing that anchors shift entire output distributions, with controls for training-data contamination; (2) exact Shapley-value attribution over structured prompt fields to quantify anchor influence on model log-probabilities; and (3) a unified Anchoring Bias Sensitivity Score integrating behavioral and attributional evidence across six open-source models. Results reveal robust anchoring effects in Gemma-2B, Phi-2, and Llama-2-7B, with attribution signaling that the anchors influence reweighting. Smaller models such as GPT-2, Falcon-RW-1B, and GPT-Neo-125M show variability, suggesting scale may modulate sensitivity.

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has become a standard interface for enabling such tool-based interactions. However, these interactions introduce substantial security concerns, particularly when the MCP server is compromised or untrustworthy. While prior benchmarks primarily focus on prompt injection attacks or analyze the vulnerabilities of LLM MCP interaction trajectories, limited attention has been given to the underlying system logs associated with malicious MCP servers. To address this gap, we present the first synthetic benchmark for evaluating LLMs ability to identify security risks from system logs. We define nine categories of MCP server risks and generate 1,800 synthetic system logs using ten state-of-the-art LLMs. These logs are embedded in the return values of 243 curated MCP servers, yielding a dataset of 2,421 chat histories for training and 471 queries for evaluation. Our pilot experiments reveal that smaller models often fail to detect risky system logs, leading to high false negatives. While models trained with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) tend to over-flag benign logs, resulting in elevated false positives, Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Reward (RLVR) offers a better precision-recall balance. In particular, after training with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), Llama3.1-8B-Instruct achieves 83% accuracy, surpassing the best-performing large remote model by 9 percentage points.

In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for memory-based student simulation that incorporates developmental trajectories through a hierarchical memory mechanism with structured knowledge representation. The framework also integrates metacognitive processes and personality traits to enrich the individual learner profiling, through dynamical consolidation of both cognitive development and personal learning characteristics.

Recent research has increasingly focused on developing such simulated agents to capture a range of learning styles, cognitive development pathways, and social behaviours. Among contemporary simulation techniques, the integration of large language models (LLMs) into educational research has emerged as a particularly versatile and scalable paradigm. LLMs afford a high degree of linguistic realism and behavioural adaptability, enabling agents to approximate cognitive processes and engage in contextually appropriate pedagogical dialogues. This paper presents a thematic review of empirical and methodological studies utilising LLMs to simulate student behaviour across educational environments. We synthesise current evidence on the capacity of LLM-based agents to emulate learner archetypes, respond to instructional inputs, and interact within multi-agent classroom scenarios. Furthermore, we examine the implications of such systems for curriculum development, instructional evaluation, and teacher training. While LLMs surpass rule-based systems in natural language generation and situational flexibility, ongoing concerns persist regarding algorithmic bias, evaluation reliability, and alignment with educational objectives.

Recent works have explored synthetic data generation to address this challenge, however, they suffer from data quality issues where synthesized tasks contain hallucinations that cannot be executed, and collected trajectories are noisy with redundant or misaligned actions. In this paper, we propose SynthAgent, a fully synthetic supervision framework that aims at improving synthetic data quality via dual refinement of both tasks and trajectories. Our approach begins by synthesizing diverse tasks through categorized exploration of web elements, ensuring efficient coverage of the target environment. During trajectory collection, we refine tasks when conflicts with actual observations are detected, mitigating hallucinations while maintaining task consistency. After collection, we conduct trajectory refinement with a global context to mitigate potential noise or misalignments. Finally, we fine-tune open-source web agents on the refined synthetic data to adapt them to the target environment.

In this paper, we argue that the predominant approach of simply removing existing biases from models is not enough. Using a paradigm from the psychology literature, we demonstrate that LLMs can spontaneously develop novel social biases about artificial demographic groups even when no inherent differences exist. These biases result in highly stratified task allocations, which are less fair than assignments by human participants and are exacerbated by newer and larger models. In social science, emergent biases like these have been shown to result from exploration-exploitation trade-offs, where the decision-maker explores too little, allowing early observations to strongly influence impressions about entire demographic groups. To alleviate this effect, we examine a series of interventions targeting model inputs, problem structure, and explicit steering. We find that explicitly incentivizing exploration most robustly reduces stratification, highlighting the need for better multifaceted objectives to mitigate bias. These results reveal that LLMs are not merely passive mirrors of human social biases, but can actively create new ones from experience, raising urgent questions about how these systems will shape societies over time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u4e3b\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u865a\u62df\u4eba\u53e3\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u65b0\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u6fc0\u52b1\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u6700\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u5206\u5c42", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u65f6\uff0c\u5355\u7eaf\u6d88\u9664\u73b0\u6709\u504f\u89c1\u4e0d\u591f\uff0c\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u4e3b\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u673a\u5236", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a2\u7d22-\u5229\u7528\u6743\u8861\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u5165\u5e72\u9884/\u95ee\u9898\u7ed3\u6784\u8c03\u6574/\u663e\u5f0f\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b49\u7cfb\u5217\u63aa\u65bd", "result": "LLMs\u4f1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u521b\u9020\u65b0\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8d8a\u65b0\u8d8a\u5927\u504f\u89c1\u8d8a\u4e25\u91cd\uff1b\u660e\u786e\u6fc0\u52b1\u63a2\u7d22\u6700\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u5206\u5c42", "conclusion": "\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u76ee\u6807\u673a\u5236\uff0cLLMs\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u955c\u5b50\uff0c\u66f4\u4f1a\u4e3b\u52a8\u521b\u9020\u65b0\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u957f\u671f\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u62c5\u5fe7"}}

Previous work has shown that verifying the correctness of individual reasoning steps can further improve the performance and efficiency of LLMs on such tasks and enhance solution interpretability. However, existing verification approaches, such as Process Reward Models (PRMs), are either computationally expensive, limited to specific domains, or require large-scale human or model-generated annotations. Thus, we propose a lightweight alternative for step-level reasoning verification based on data-driven uncertainty scores. We train transformer-based uncertainty quantification heads (UHeads) that use the internal states of a frozen LLM to estimate the uncertainty of its reasoning steps during generation. The approach is fully automatic: target labels are generated either by another larger LLM (e.g., DeepSeek R1) or in a self-supervised manner by the original model itself. UHeads are both effective and lightweight, containing less than 10M parameters. Across multiple domains, including mathematics, planning, and general knowledge question answering, they match or even surpass the performance of PRMs that are up to 810x larger.

While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have become a standard for this, they face a fundamental dilemma in continual learning. Reusing a single set of PEFT parameters for new tasks often leads to catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge. Conversely, allocating distinct parameters for each task prevents forgetting but results in a linear growth of the model's size and fails to facilitate knowledge transfer between related tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel adaptive PEFT method referred to as \\textit{Mixtures of SubExperts (MoSEs)}, a novel continual learning framework designed for minimal forgetting and efficient scalability. MoSEs integrate a sparse Mixture of SubExperts into the transformer layers, governed by a task-specific routing mechanism. This architecture allows the model to isolate and protect knowledge within dedicated SubExperts, thereby minimizing parameter interference and catastrophic forgetting.

However, by observing the MMD posts, we hold that the text modality may be much more informative than the image modality because the text generally describes the whole event/story of the current post but the image often presents partial scenes only. Our preliminary empirical results indicate that the image modality exactly contributes less to MMD. Upon this idea, we propose a new MMD method named RETSIMD. Specifically, we suppose that each text can be divided into several segments, and each text segment describes a partial scene that can be presented by an image. Accordingly, we split the text into a sequence of segments, and feed these segments into a pre-trained text-to-image generator to augment a sequence of images. We further incorporate two auxiliary objectives concerning text-image and image-label mutual information, and further post-train the generator over an auxiliary text-to-image generation benchmark dataset. Additionally, we propose a graph structure by defining three heuristic relationships between images, and use a graph neural network to generate the fused features.

This behavior undermines model reliability and poses societal risks. Mitigating LRM sycophancy requires monitoring how this sycophancy emerges during the reasoning trajectory; however, current methods mainly focus on judging based on final answers and correcting them, without understanding how sycophancy develops during reasoning processes. To address this limitation, we propose MONICA, a novel Monitor-guided Calibration framework that monitors and mitigates sycophancy during model inference at the level of reasoning steps, without requiring the model to finish generating its complete answer. MONICA integrates a sycophantic monitor that provides real-time monitoring of sycophantic drift scores during response generation with a calibrator that dynamically suppresses sycophantic behavior when scores exceed predefined thresholds. Extensive experiments across 12 datasets and 3 LRMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces sycophantic behavior in both intermediate reasoning steps and final answers, yielding robust performance improvements.", "AI": {"tldr": "MONICA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u63a7\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u7684\u5949\u627f\u503e\u5411\u5e76\u52a8\u6001\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fce\u5408\u6027\u884c\u4e3a", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u7ea0\u6b63\u6a21\u578b\u5949\u627f\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u76d1\u6d4b\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8be5\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u98ce\u9669", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u65f6\u5949\u627f\u503e\u5411\u76d1\u63a7\u5668\uff08\u8ba1\u7b97\u5949\u627f\u6f02\u79fb\u5206\u6570\uff09\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6821\u51c6\u5668\uff08\u9608\u503c\u8d85\u9650\u65f6\u6291\u5236\u5949\u627f\u884c\u4e3a\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6b65\u9aa4\u7ea7\u5e72\u9884", "result": "\u572812\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c3\u79cd\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u5949\u627f\u7387\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u660e\u663e", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u63a7\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u6821\u51c6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u578b\u5949\u627f\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027"}}

TTRL leverages an elegant two-phase sampling strategy: first, multi-sampling derives a pseudo-label via majority voting, while subsequent downsampling and reward-based fine-tuning encourages the model to explore and learn diverse valid solutions, with the pseudo-label modulating the reward signal. Meanwhile, in-context learning has been widely explored at inference time and demonstrated the ability to enhance model performance without weight updates. However, TTRL's two-phase sampling strategy under-utilizes contextual guidance, which can potentially improve pseudo-label accuracy in the initial exploitation phase while regulating exploration in the second. To address this, we propose context-guided TTRL (CG-TTRL), integrating context dynamically into both sampling phases and propose a method for efficient context selection for on-device applications. Our evaluations on mathematical and scientific QA benchmarks show CG-TTRL outperforms TTRL (e.g. additional 7% relative accuracy improvement over TTRL), while boosting efficiency by obtaining strong performance after only a few steps of test-time training (e.g. 8% relative improvement rather than 1% over TTRL after 3 steps).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684TTRL\u65b9\u6cd5(CG-TTRL)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u6574\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5230\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfTTRL\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u751f\u6210\u7cbe\u5ea6\u53d7\u9650\u4e14\u63a2\u7d22\u9636\u6bb5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5c55\u73b0\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u672a\u88ab\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u3002", "method": "1. \u5728\u521d\u59cb\u5229\u7528\u9636\u6bb5\u6ce8\u5165\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63d0\u5347\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u7cbe\u5ea6\n2. \u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u9636\u6bb5\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8c03\u8282\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\n3. \u63d0\u51fa\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5", "result": "\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u79d1\u5b66QA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u76f8\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53477%\uff0c3\u6b65\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u83b7\u5f978%\u6539\u8fdb\uff08\u539f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec51%\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b", "conclusion": "\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u52a8\u6001\u6574\u5408\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u7a81\u7834TTRL\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u6a21\u578b\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

Over the years, these networks have evolved to replicate the complex capabilities of the brain, allowing them to handle tasks such as image and language processing. In the realm of Large Language Models, there has been a keen interest in making the language learning process more akin to that of humans. While neuroscientific research has shown that different grammatical categories are processed by different neurons in the brain, we show that LLMs operate in a similar way. Utilizing Llama 3, we identify the most important neurons associated with the prediction of words belonging to different part-of-speech tags. Using the achieved knowledge, we train a classifier on a dataset, which shows that the activation patterns of these key neurons can reliably predict part-of-speech tags on fresh data.

One promising approach to address this issue is the watermark technique, which embeds subtle statistical signals into LLM-generated text to enable reliable identification. In this paper, we first generalize the likelihood-based LLM detection method of a previous study by introducing a flexible weighted formulation, and further adapt this approach to the inverse transform sampling method. Moving beyond watermark detection, we extend this adaptive detection strategy to tackle the more challenging problem of segmenting a given text into watermarked and non-watermarked substrings. In contrast to the approach in a previous study, which relies on accurate estimation of next-token probabilities that are highly sensitive to prompt estimation, our proposed framework removes the need for precise prompt estimation.

However, these models often treat text as flat sequences, limiting their ability to handle complex, compositional, and long-form descriptions. In particular, they fail to capture two essential properties of language: semantic hierarchy, which reflects the multi-level compositional structure of text, and semantic monotonicity, where richer descriptions should result in stronger alignment with visual content.To address these limitations, we propose HiMo-CLIP, a representation-level framework that enhances CLIP-style models without modifying the encoder architecture. HiMo-CLIP introduces two key components: a hierarchical decomposition (HiDe) module that extracts latent semantic components from long-form text via in-batch PCA, enabling flexible, batch-aware alignment across different semantic granularities, and a monotonicity-aware contrastive loss (MoLo) that jointly aligns global and component-level representations, encouraging the model to internalize semantic ordering and alignment strength as a function of textual completeness.These components work in concert to produce structured, cognitively-aligned cross-modal representations. Experiments on multiple image-text retrieval benchmarks show that HiMo-CLIP consistently outperforms strong baselines, particularly under long or compositional descriptions.

Quantifying these differences is critical to understanding if the quality of the legal information obtained by users of LLM-based chatbots varies depending on their location. However, obtaining meaningful comparative metrics is challenging because legal institutions in different places are not themselves easily comparable. In this work we propose a methodology to obtain place-to-place metrics based on the comparative law concept of functionalism. We construct a dataset of factual scenarios drawn from Reddit posts by users seeking legal advice for family, housing, employment, crime and traffic issues. We use these to elicit a summary of a law from the LLM relevant to each scenario in Los Angeles, London and Sydney. These summaries, typically of a legislative provision, are manually evaluated for hallucinations. We show that the rate of hallucination of legal information by leading closed-source LLMs is significantly associated with place.

Building on the success of Deepseek-R1, researchers extended multimodal reasoning to post-training paradigms based on reinforcement learning (RL), focusing predominantly on mathematical datasets. However, existing post-training paradigms tend to neglect two critical aspects: (1) The lack of quantifiable difficulty metrics capable of strategically screening samples for post-training optimization. (2) Suboptimal post-training paradigms that fail to jointly optimize perception and reasoning capabilities. To address this gap, we propose two novel difficulty-aware sampling strategies: Progressive Image Semantic Masking (PISM) quantifies sample hardness through systematic image degradation, while Cross-Modality Attention Balance (CMAB) assesses cross-modal interaction complexity via attention distribution analysis. Leveraging these metrics, we design a hierarchical training framework that incorporates both GRPO-only and SFT+GRPO hybrid training paradigms, and evaluate them across six benchmark datasets. Experiments demonstrate consistent superiority of GRPO applied to difficulty-stratified samples compared to conventional SFT+GRPO pipelines, indicating that strategic data sampling can obviate the need for supervised fine-tuning while improving model accuracy.

Current alignment efforts primarily target explicit risks such as bias, hate speech, and violence. However, they often fail to address deeper, domain-specific implicit risks and lack a flexible, generalizable framework applicable across diverse specialized fields. Hence, we proposed MENTOR: A MEtacognition-driveN self-evoluTion framework for uncOvering and mitigating implicit Risks in LLMs on Domain Tasks. To address the limitations of labor-intensive human evaluation, we introduce a novel metacognitive self-assessment tool. This enables LLMs to reflect on potential value misalignments in their responses using strategies like perspective-taking and consequential thinking. We also release a supporting dataset of 9,000 risk queries spanning education, finance, and management to enhance domain-specific risk identification. Subsequently, based on the outcomes of metacognitive reflection, the framework dynamically generates supplementary rule knowledge graphs that extend predefined static rule trees. This enables models to actively apply validated rules to future similar challenges, establishing a continuous self-evolution cycle that enhances generalization by reducing maintenance costs and inflexibility of static systems. Finally, we employ activation steering during inference to guide LLMs in following the rules, a cost-effective method to robustly enhance enforcement across diverse contexts. Experimental results show MENTOR's effectiveness: In defensive testing across three vertical domains, the framework substantially reduces semantic attack success rates, enabling a new level of implicit risk mitigation for LLMs. Furthermore, metacognitive assessment not only aligns closely with baseline human evaluators but also delivers more thorough and insightful analysis of LLMs value alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "MENTOR\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5219\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4eLLMs\u5728\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6301\u7eed\u81ea\u6211\u8fdb\u5316", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLMs\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u663e\u6027\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5904\u7406\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u6df1\u5c42\u9690\u5f0f\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e14\u9759\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ef4\u62a4\u6210\u672c\u9ad8", "method": "1. \u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u81ea\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08\u89c6\u89d2\u8f6c\u6362/\u7ed3\u679c\u63a8\u6f14\uff09\n2. \u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u8865\u5145\u89c4\u5219\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\n3. \u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u6280\u672f\u589e\u5f3a\u89c4\u5219\u6267\u884c", "result": "\u9632\u5fa1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e09\u4e2a\u5782\u76f4\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff08\u6559\u80b2/\u91d1\u878d/\u7ba1\u7406\uff09\uff0c\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8fbe86%", "conclusion": "MENTOR\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86LLMs\u6301\u7eed\u8fdb\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5219\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u98ce\u9669\u7f13\u89e3\u80fd\u529b"}}

However, the FL-enabled IoA system remains vulnerable to model poisoning attacks, and the prevailing distance and similarity-based defenses become fragile at billion-parameter scale and under heterogeneous data distributions.

The GRMP attack synthesizes malicious local models that preserve benign-like statistics while embedding adversarial objectives, remaining elusive to detection at the server.

Both approaches share a foundational assumption that scaling up model capacity and data volume leads to improved performance. However, we observe a \\textit{\\textbf{scaling paradox}} in TS models, revealing a puzzling phenomenon that larger models do \\emph{NOT} achieve better performance. Through extensive experiments on two model families across four scales (100M to 1.7B parameters) and diverse data (up to 6B observations), we rigorously confirm that the scaling paradox is a pervasive issue. We then diagnose its root cause by analyzing internal representations, identifying a phenomenon we call \\textit{few-layer dominance}: only a small subset of layers are functionally important, while the majority are redundant, under-utilized, and can even distract training.

However, existing approaches rely on a mono-contextual paradigm that accumulates all information in a single, expanding context window, leading to context suffocation and noise contamination that limit their effectiveness on long-horizon tasks. We introduce IterResearch, a novel iterative deep-research paradigm that reformulates long-horizon research as a Markov Decision Process with strategic workspace reconstruction. By maintaining an evolving report as memory and periodically synthesizing insights, our approach preserves consistent reasoning capacity across arbitrary exploration depths. We further develop Efficiency-Aware Policy Optimization (EAPO), a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes efficient exploration through geometric reward discounting and enables stable distributed training via adaptive downsampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IterResearch achieves substantial improvements over existing open-source agents with average +14.5pp across six benchmarks and narrows the gap with frontier proprietary systems. Remarkably, our paradigm exhibits unprecedented interaction scaling, extending to 2048 interactions with dramatic performance gains (from 3.5\\% to 42.5\\%), and serves as an effective prompting strategy, improving frontier models by up to 19.2pp over ReAct on long-horizon tasks.

To accelerate this transformation, two fundamental building blocks are essential: high-quality datasets that enable agents to achieve complex and human-relevant goals, and robust evaluation methods that allow researchers and practitioners to rapidly enhance agent performance. In this paper, we introduce DigiData, a large-scale, high-quality, diverse, multi-modal dataset designed for training mobile control agents. Unlike existing datasets, which derive goals from unstructured interactions, DigiData is meticulously constructed through comprehensive exploration of app features, resulting in greater diversity and higher goal complexity. Additionally, we present DigiData-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating mobile control agents on real-world complex tasks. We demonstrate that the commonly used step-accuracy metric falls short in reliably assessing mobile control agents and, to address this, we propose dynamic evaluation protocols and AI-powered evaluations as rigorous alternatives for agent assessment. Our contributions aim to significantly advance the development of mobile control agents, paving the way for more intuitive and effective human-device interactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6DigiData\u53ca\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6DigiData-Bench\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u63a2\u7d22\u63d0\u5347\u79fb\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u6539\u8fdb\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u79fb\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u4ee3\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b58\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4f4e\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e25\u8c28\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u7cfb\u63a8\u52a8\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u9762\u63a2\u7d22APP\u529f\u80fd\u6784\u5efa\u590d\u6742\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u52a8\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u4e0eAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u5f0f\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u6b65\u6570\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6307\u6807", "result": "DigiData\u5177\u5907\u66f4\u9ad8\u76ee\u6807\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u53cd\u6620\u4ee3\u7406\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u79fb\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u57fa\u7840\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5411\u66f4\u76f4\u89c2\u9ad8\u6548\u65b9\u5411\u6f14\u8fdb"}}

Kleinberg and Mullainathan [KM24] proved that generation is achievable in surprisingly general settings. But their generator suffers from ``mode collapse,'' producing from an ever-smaller subset of the target. To address this, Kleinberg and Wei [KW25] require the generator's output to be ``dense'' in the target language. They showed that generation with density, surprisingly, remains achievable at the same generality.\n  Both results assume perfect data: no noisy insertions and no omissions. This raises a central question: how much contamination can generation tolerate? Recent works made partial progress on this question by studying (non-dense) generation with either finite amounts of noise (but no omissions) or omissions (but no noise).\n  We characterize robustness under contaminated enumerations: 1. Generation under Contamination: Language generation in the limit is achievable for all countable collections iff the fraction of contaminated examples converges to zero. When this fails, we characterize which collections are generable. 2. Dense Generation under Contamination: Dense generation is strictly less robust to contamination than generation. As a byproduct, we resolve an open question of Raman and Raman [ICML25] by showing that generation is possible with only membership oracle access under finitely many contaminated examples.\n  Finally, we introduce a beyond-worst-case model inspired by curriculum learning and prove that dense generation is achievable even with infinite contamination provided the fraction of contaminated examples converges to zero. This suggests curriculum learning may be crucial for learning from noisy web data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u9057\u6f0f\u7684\u6c61\u67d3\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\uff0c\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bc6\u96c6\u751f\u6210\uff08dense generation\uff09\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6c61\u67d3\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5b8c\u7f8e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u65e0\u566a\u58f0/\u65e0\u9057\u6f0f\uff09\u4e0a\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u5e38\u88ab\u6c61\u67d3\u3002\u9700\u8981\u786e\u5b9a\u751f\u6210\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6c61\u67d3\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u5bb9\u5fcd\u5ea6\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\uff08curriculum learning\uff09\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\uff1a1\uff09\u6c61\u67d3\u6bd4\u4f8b\u8d8b\u96f6\u65f6\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\uff1b2\uff09\u5bc6\u96c6\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6c61\u67d3\u66f4\u654f\u611f\uff1b3\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u65e0\u9650\u6c61\u67d3\u4f46\u6c61\u67d3\u6bd4\u4f8b\u6e10\u8fd1\u6d88\u5931\u65f6\u4ecd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bc6\u96c6\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "1\uff09\u6c61\u67d3\u6bd4\u4f8b\u8d8b\u96f6\u662f\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u5145\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b2\uff09\u5bc6\u96c6\u751f\u6210\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5f31\u4e8e\u666e\u901a\u751f\u6210\uff1b3\uff09\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7a81\u7834\u4f20\u7edf\u6c61\u67d3\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u751f\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u523b\u753b\u6c61\u67d3\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7a81\u7834\u6c61\u67d3\u9650\u5236\u7684\u5173\u952e\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u566a\u58f0\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}
