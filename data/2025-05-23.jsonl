First, a general-purpose LLM is\npreference-tuned to generate rationales conditioned on the input query using\ndirect preference optimization. These rationales guide the evidence chunk\nselection engine, which selects relevant chunks in three stages: pairing\nindividual rationales with corresponding retrieved chunks for local relevance,\nglobal selection with elbow detection for adaptive cutoff, and context\nexpansion via neighboring chunks.

However, these tasks\nprimarily focus on single-turn interactions with simplified instructions, which\ndo not truly reflect the challenges of providing meaningful assistance to\nusers. To provide personalized assistance, embodied agents must understand the\nunique semantics that users assign to the physical world (e.g., favorite cup,\nbreakfast routine) by leveraging prior interaction history to interpret\ndynamic, real-world instructions. Yet, the effectiveness of embodied agents in\nutilizing memory for personalized assistance remains largely underexplored. To\naddress this gap, we present MEMENTO, a personalized embodied agent evaluation\nframework designed to comprehensively assess memory utilization capabilities to\nprovide personalized assistance. Our framework consists of a two-stage memory\nevaluation process design that enables quantifying the impact of memory\nutilization on task performance. This process enables the evaluation of agents'\nunderstanding of personalized knowledge in object rearrangement tasks by\nfocusing on its role in goal interpretation: (1) the ability to identify target\nobjects based on personal meaning (object semantics), and (2) the ability to\ninfer object-location configurations from consistent user patterns, such as\nroutines (user patterns). Our experiments across various LLMs reveal\nsignificant limitations in memory utilization, with even frontier models like\nGPT-4o experiencing a 30.5% performance drop when required to reference\nmultiple memories, particularly in tasks involving user patterns. These\nfindings, along with our detailed analyses and case studies, provide valuable\ninsights for future research in developing more effective personalized embodied\nagents.

Since attention by itself is permutation-invariant,\nposition encoding is essential for modeling structured domains such as\nlanguage. Rotary position encoding (RoPE) has emerged as the de facto standard\napproach for position encoding and is part of many modern LLMs. However, in\nRoPE the key/query transformation between two elements in a sequence is only a\nfunction of their relative position and otherwise independent of the actual\ninput. This limits the expressivity of RoPE-based transformers.\n  This paper describes PaTH, a flexible data-dependent position encoding scheme\nbased on accumulated products of Householder(like) transformations, where each\ntransformation is data-dependent, i.e., a function of the input.

However, this reasoning\nprocess has been confined exclusively to textual space, limiting its\neffectiveness in visually intensive tasks. To address this limitation, we\nintroduce the concept of reasoning in the pixel-space. Within this novel\nframework, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are equipped with a suite of visual\nreasoning operations, such as zoom-in and select-frame. These operations enable\nVLMs to directly inspect, interrogate, and infer from visual evidences, thereby\nenhancing reasoning fidelity for visual tasks. Cultivating such pixel-space\nreasoning capabilities in VLMs presents notable challenges, including the\nmodel's initially imbalanced competence and its reluctance to adopt the newly\nintroduced pixel-space operations. We address these challenges through a\ntwo-phase training approach. The first phase employs instruction tuning on\nsynthesized reasoning traces to familiarize the model with the novel visual\noperations. Following this, a reinforcement learning (RL) phase leverages a\ncuriosity-driven reward scheme to balance exploration between pixel-space\nreasoning and textual reasoning. With these visual operations, VLMs can\ninteract with complex visual inputs, such as information-rich images or videos\nto proactively gather necessary information. We demonstrate that this approach\nsignificantly improves VLM performance across diverse visual reasoning\nbenchmarks. Our 7B model, \\model, achieves 84\\% on V* bench, 74\\% on\nTallyQA-Complex, and 84\\% on InfographicsVQA, marking the highest accuracy\nachieved by any open-source model to date.

However, we highlight a critical flaw:\nthe powerful general adaptability of LLMs allows them to easily bypass\nselective unlearning by rapidly relearning or repurposing their capabilities\nfor harmful tasks. To address this fundamental limitation, we propose a\nparadigm shift: instead of selective removal, we advocate for inducing model\ncollapse--effectively forcing the model to \"unlearn everything\"--specifically\nin response to updates characteristic of malicious adaptation. This collapse\ndirectly neutralizes the very general capabilities that attackers exploit,\ntackling the core issue unaddressed by selective unlearning. We introduce the\nCollapse Trap (CTRAP) as a practical mechanism to implement this concept\nconditionally. Embedded during alignment, CTRAP pre-configures the model's\nreaction to subsequent fine-tuning dynamics. If updates during fine-tuning\nconstitute a persistent attempt to reverse safety alignment, the pre-configured\ntrap triggers a progressive degradation of the model's core language modeling\nabilities, ultimately rendering it inert and useless for the attacker.\nCrucially, this collapse mechanism remains dormant during benign fine-tuning,\nensuring the model's utility and general capabilities are preserved for\nlegitimate users.

More recently,\nit has emerged as an important subroutine in deep learning, particularly within\nthe Muon optimization framework. However, the requirements in this setting\ndiffer significantly from those of traditional numerical analysis. In deep\nlearning, methods must be highly efficient and GPU-compatible, but high\naccuracy is often unnecessary. As a result, classical algorithms like\nNewton-Schulz (which suffers from slow initial convergence) and methods based\non rational functions (which rely on QR decompositions or matrix inverses) are\npoorly suited to this context. In this work, we introduce Polar Express, a\nGPU-friendly algorithm for computing the polar decomposition. Like classical\npolynomial methods such as Newton-Schulz, our approach uses only matrix-matrix\nmultiplications, making it GPU-compatible. Motivated by earlier work of Chen &\nChow and Nakatsukasa & Freund, Polar Express adapts the polynomial update rule\nat each iteration by solving a minimax optimization problem, and we prove that\nit enjoys a strong worst-case optimality guarantee. This property ensures both\nrapid early convergence and fast asymptotic convergence. We also address\nfinite-precision issues, making it stable in bfloat16 in practice. We apply\nPolar Express within the Muon optimization framework and show consistent\nimprovements in validation loss on large-scale models such as GPT-2,\noutperforming recent alternatives across a range of learning rates."}
